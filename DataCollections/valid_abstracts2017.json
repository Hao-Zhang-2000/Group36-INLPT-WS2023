{"abstracts": ["The neurometabolism underlying the cognitive and affective symptoms associated with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) remain poorly understood. After we have linked worry to intelligence in patients with GAD, we hypothesized that aberrant neurometabolic correlations between hippocampus and neocortical regions may underlie a shared substrate in GAD patients for both anxiety sensitivity and intelligence.\nGAD patients (n = 16; F = 11) and healthy volunteers (n = 16; F = 10) were assessed using 1H-MRSI. Co-axial planes I [hippocampus (HIPP)] and co-axial plane III [dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), central gyrus (CG)] were examined. Using general linear models, we examined resting metabolite concentrations using HIPP as a hub to CG and DLPFC. Neocortical ROIs were related to Anxiety Sensitivity Index (ASI) and Full Scale IQ (FSIQ) in GAD patients versus controls.\nRight hippocampal Cho/Cr directly predicted left DLPFC Cho/Cr in GAD (r = 0.75), an effect distinguishable (p = 0.0004) from controls. Left HIPP Cho/Cr positively predicted left CG Cho/Cr in GAD, an effect distinguishable from controls. In patients, both left and right DLPFC Cho/Cr positively predicted ASI but only left DLPFC Cho/Cr inversely predicted IQ. By contrast, IQ in controls correlated directly with left CG Cho/Cr.\nSmall sample size precluded us from investigating how gender and FSIQ subscales related to neurochemical correlations in the ROIs examined.\nAberrant resting state neurochemical correlation between left DLPFC and right HIPP may contribute to GAD symptomatology. Unlike controls, in GAD, IQ and worry may share a common yet inverse neurometabolic substrate in left DLPFC.", "Sepsis is among the leading causes of morbidity, mortality, and cost overruns in critically ill patients. Early intervention with antibiotics improves survival in septic patients. However, no clinically validated system exists for real-time prediction of sepsis onset. We aimed to develop and validate an Artificial Intelligence Sepsis Expert algorithm for early prediction of sepsis.\nObservational cohort study.\nAcademic medical center from January 2013 to December 2015.\nOver 31,000 admissions to the ICUs at two Emory University hospitals (development cohort), in addition to over 52,000 ICU patients from the publicly available Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-III ICU database (validation cohort). Patients who met the Third International Consensus Definitions for Sepsis (Sepsis-3) prior to or within 4 hours of their ICU admission were excluded, resulting in roughly 27,000 and 42,000 patients within our development and validation cohorts, respectively.\nNone.\nHigh-resolution vital signs time series and electronic medical record data were extracted. A set of 65 features (variables) were calculated on hourly basis and passed to the Artificial Intelligence Sepsis Expert algorithm to predict onset of sepsis in the proceeding T hours (where T = 12, 8, 6, or 4). Artificial Intelligence Sepsis Expert was used to predict onset of sepsis in the proceeding T hours and to produce a list of the most significant contributing factors. For the 12-, 8-, 6-, and 4-hour ahead prediction of sepsis, Artificial Intelligence Sepsis Expert achieved area under the receiver operating characteristic in the range of 0.83-0.85. Performance of the Artificial Intelligence Sepsis Expert on the development and validation cohorts was indistinguishable.\nUsing data available in the ICU in real-time, Artificial Intelligence Sepsis Expert can accurately predict the onset of sepsis in an ICU patient 4-12 hours prior to clinical recognition. A prospective study is necessary to determine the clinical utility of the proposed sepsis prediction model.", "A new type of flexible proximity sensor that uses a microsized organic crystal as the sensing element is demonstrated. The two-terminal organic sensor can accurately perceive the external objects, such as the human finger, fiber, and even atomic force microscopy tip. The proximity sensor shows an unprecedented distance resolution of 0.05 mm, which is 2 orders of magnitude higher than that of the previously reported conventional capacitor proximity sensors. A novel method has been proposed to realize the location detection of the approaching unknown-charge object by changing the distance between the stimulus and the sensor. Our results open a new route to realize an ultrasensitive perception of objects, making it a promising candidate for applications in artificial intelligence, healthcare systems, and high-precision robots.", "The fifth edition of the Stanford-Binet Intelligence scales allows 'full scale' IQ (FSIQ) to be estimated using an abridged version of the test-the abbreviated battery IQ (ABIQ). Set within a public early intervention team service, the current cross-sectional study investigated the utility of the ABIQ in estimating FSIQ for 40 children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) aged 3-5 years. A strong ABIQ-FSIQ association was yielded (r\u2009=\u20090.89; r2 \u2009=\u20090.808) and the ABIQ did not over-estimate mean FSIQ above a clinically-relevant threshold; however, clinically significant over-estimation occurred in 17.5% of individual cases. While the findings provide support for the utility of the ABIQ in estimating FSIQ for young children with ASD, caution relating to the over-estimation of FSIQ is warranted. Careful clinical judgment-ideally based on examination of previous cognitive assessment results (if available), thorough interactional observations, and close multi-disciplinary consultation-is necessary to determine the applicability of the ABIQ to individual cases. Autism Res 2018, 11: 503-508. \u00a9 2017 International Society for Autism Research, Wiley Periodicals, Inc.\nWe investigated the utility of a shortened version of the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scales in estimating IQ for 40 young children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The findings provide qualified support for the instrument: acceptably accurate IQ estimation was achieved for most cases; but not so for a sizeable minority (17.5%). Careful clinical judgment is necessary to determine the applicability of the ABIQ to individual cases.", "The term \"digital health\" is currently the most comprehensive term that includes all information and communication technologies in healthcare, including e-health, mobile health, telemedicine, big data, health apps and others. Digital health can be seen as a good example of the use of the concept and methodology of health services research in the interaction between complex interventions and complex contexts. The position paper deals with 1) digital health as the subject of health services research; 2) digital health as a methodological and ethical challenge for health services research. The often-postulated benefits of digital health interventions should be demonstrated with good studies. First systematic evaluations of apps for \"treatment support\" show that risks are higher than benefits. The need for a rigorous proof applies even more to big data-assisted interventions that support decision-making in the treatment process with the support of artificial intelligence. Of course, from the point of view of health services research, it is worth participating as much as possible in data access available through digital health and \"big data\". However, there is the risk that a noncritical application of digital health and big data will lead to a return to a linear understanding of biomedical research, which, at best, accepts complex conditions assuming multivariate models but does not take complex facts into account. It is not just a matter of scientific ethical requirements in health services care research, for instance, better research instead of unnecessary research (\"reducing waste\"), but it is primarily a matter of anticipating the social consequences (system level) of scientific analysis and evaluation. This is both a challenge and an attractive option for health services research to present itself as a mature and responsible scientific discipline.\nDer Begriff Digital Health (digitale Gesundheitsanwendungen) ist zurzeit der umfassendste und schlie\u00dft alle Informations- und Kommunikationstechnologien aus dem Gesundheitsbereich mit ein, inkl. E-Health, Mobile Health, Telemedizin, Big Data, Gesundheits-Apps und anderen. Digital Health kann als ein Paradebeispiel f\u00fcr den Einsatz des Konzeptes und der Methodik der Versorgungsforschung gelten, wo es um das Zusammenspiel von komplexen Interventionen und komplexem Kontext geht. Das Positionspapier betrachtet 1) Digital Health als Gegenstand der Versorgungsforschung und 2) Digital Health als methodische und wissenschaftsethische Herausforderung f\u00fcr die Versorgungsforschung. Der h\u00e4ufig postulierte Nutzen, der von Digital Health-Interventionen erwartet wird, sollte durch gute Studien nachweisbar sein. Erste systematische Evaluationen von Apps zur \u201eBehandlungsunterst\u00fctzung\u201c liefern teilweise Ergebnisse, die eher auf einen Schaden, denn auf einen Nutzen hinweisen. Die Forderung eines Nachweises von Nutzen bzw. Risiken gilt erst recht f\u00fcr Big Data-gest\u00fctzte Interventionen, die Entscheidungsprozesse im Behandlungsablauf unter Zuhilfenahme von K\u00fcnstlicher Intelligenz unterst\u00fctzen. Nat\u00fcrlich ist es aus Sicht der Versorgungsforschung anstrebenswert, m\u00f6glichst an dem durch Digital Health verf\u00fcgbaren Datenzugang zu partizipieren und \u201eBig Data\u201c zu nutzen. Es besteht allerdings die Gefahr, dass es durch eine unkritische Anwendung von Digital Health und Big Data zu einer R\u00fcckkehr zum linearen, naturwissenschaftlich-biomedizinischen Forschungsverst\u00e4ndnis kommt, der bestenfalls komplizierte Verh\u00e4ltnisse unter der Annahme multivariater Modelle akzeptiert und komplexe Sachverhalte nicht zur Kenntnis nimmt. Es geht f\u00fcr die Versorgungsforschung nicht nur darum, wissenschaftsethischen Anforderungen zu gen\u00fcgen, indem statt unn\u00f6tiger Forschung (\u201ereducing waste\u201c) bessere Forschung gemacht wird, sondern vor allem darum, die gesellschaftlichen Konsequenzen (Systemebene) der wissenschaftlichen Analyse und Evaluation zu antizipieren. Dies birgt f\u00fcr die Versorgungsforschung die anspruchsvolle, gleichseitig aber attraktive Option, sich \u00fcber die Kompetenz, eine solche Diskussion zu initiieren und zu f\u00fchren, als reifes und verantwortungsvolles Wissenschaftsgebiet zu pr\u00e4sentieren.", "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relation between cognitive performance and white matter (WM) integrity in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) with mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS).\nWe included 26 patients with TLE (10 right, 16 left onset) as well as 24 healthy controls matched for age, gender, and years of education. In addition to quantitative hippocampal volume and transverse relaxation (T2) evaluation, whole-brain WM was analyzed using fractional anisotropy (FA) maps, derived from the diffusion tensor model. Average FA values were obtained from 38 regions of interest (ROI) of the main WM fascicles using an atlas-based approach. All subjects underwent extensive coFignitive assessments, Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS-IV) and Wechsler Memory Scale (WMS-IV). Fractional anisotropy was correlated with neuropsychological scores, and group effects were evaluated. Finally, patients were clustered based on their cognitive performance to evaluate if clinical and structural variables relate to specific cognitive profiles.\nPatients had differential alterations in the integrity of the WM dependent on seizure laterality and presence of hippocampal sclerosis. Patients with TLE showed, on average, lower scores in most of the cognitive assessments. Correlations between cognition and WM followed specific trajectories per group with TLE, particularly in Left-TLE, in which we found a marked association between cognitive abilities and WM abnormalities. Cluster analysis of cognitive performance revealed three cognitive profiles, which were associated with the degree and spread of WM abnormalities.\nWhite matter diffusion characteristics differ between patients, particularly in relation to seizure laterality and hippocampal damage. Moreover, WM abnormalities are associated with cognitive performance. The extent of WM alterations leads to disrupted cerebral intercommunication and therefore negatively affects cognition.", "During the third quarter of 2017, Cortellis Competitive Intelligence registered 949 new deals (excluding mergers and acquisitions) added as part of its ongoing coverage of pharmaceutical licensing activity compared to 1,007 in Q2 this year and 1,023 in Q3 the previous year.", "To define the emotional intelligence (EI) profile of emergency medicine (EM) residents, and identify resident EI strengths and weaknesses.\nFirst-, second-, and third-year residents (post-graduate years [PGY] 1, 2, and 3, respectively) of Thomas Jefferson University Hospital's EM Program completed the Emotional Quotient Inventory (EQ-i 2.0), a validated instrument offered by Multi-Health Systems. Reported scores included total mean EI, 5 composite scores, and 15 subscales of EI. Scores are reported as means with 95% CIs. The unpaired, two-sample t-test was used to evaluate differences in means.\nThirty-five residents completed the assessment (response rate 97.2%). Scores were normed to the general population (mean 100, SD 15). Total mean EI for the cohort was 103 (95%CI,100-108). EI was higher in female (107) than male (101) residents. PGY-2s demonstrated the lowest mean EI (95) versus PGY-1s (104) and PGY-3s (110). The difference in PGY-3 EI (110; 95%CI,103-116) and PGY-1 EI (95, 95%CI,87-104) was statistically significant (unpaired t-test, p<0.01). Highest composite scores were in interpersonal skills (107; 95%CI,100-108) and stress management (105; 95%CI,101-109). Subscale cohort strengths included self-actualization (107); empathy (107); interpersonal relationships (106); impulse control (106); and stress tolerance (106). Lowest subscale score was in assertiveness (98). Self-regard (89), assertiveness (88), and independence (90) were areas in which PGY-2s attained relatively lower scores (unpaired t-test, p<0.05) compared to their peers and the general population. PGY-3's scored highest in nearly all subscales.\nThe EQ-i offers insight into training that may assist in developing EM residents, specifically in self-regard, assertiveness, and self-expression. Further study is required to ascertain if patterns in level of training are idiosyncratic or relate to the natural maturation of residents.", "Purpose. This study aimed to develop a motor-free short-form of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Fifth Edition (WISC-V) that allows clinicians to estimate the Full Scale Intelligence Quotients of youths with motor impairments. Method. Using the reliabilities and intercorrelations of six WISC-V motor-free subtests, psychometric methodologies were applied to develop look-up tables for four Motor-free Short-form indices: Verbal Comprehension Short-form, Perceptual Reasoning Short-form, Working Memory Short-form, and a Motor-free Intelligence Quotient. Index-level discrepancy tables were developed using the same methods to allow clinicians to statistically compare visual, verbal, and working memory abilities. Results. The short-form indices had excellent reliabilities (r = .92-.97) comparable to the original WISC-V. Conclusion. This motor-free short-form of the WISC-V is a reliable alternative for the assessment of intellectual functioning in youths with motor impairments. Clinicians are provided with user-friendly look-up tables, index level discrepancy tables, and base rates, displayed similar to those in the WISC-V manuals to enable interpretation of assessment results.", "Objectives: The Jansari assessment of Executive Functions for Children (JEF-C\u00a9) is a new non-immersive computerised assessment of executive functions. The objectives of the study were to test the feasibility and validity of JEF-C\u00a9 in children and adolescents with acquired brain injury (ABI). Methods: Twenty-nine patients with ABI aged 10-18 years and 30 age-and gender-matched controls were tested. Participants performed JEF-C\u00a9, Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI) and the Behavioural Assessment of the Dysexecutive Syndrome for Children (BADS-C), while parents completed the Behaviour Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF) questionnaire. Results: The JEF-C\u00a9 task proved feasible in patients with ABI. The internal consistency was medium (Cronbach's alpha\u2009=\u20090.62 and significant intercorrelations between individual JEF-C\u00a9 constructs). Patients performed significantly worse than controls on most of the JEF-C\u00a9 subscales and total score, with 41.4% of participants with ABI classified as having severe executive dysfunction. No significant correlations were found between JEF-C\u00a9 total score, the BRIEF indices, and the BADS-C. Significant correlations were found between JEF-C\u00a9 and demographic characteristics of the sample and intellectual ability, but not with severity/medical variables. Conclusion: JEF-C\u00a9 is a playful complex task that appears to be a sensitive and ecologically valid assessment tool, especially for relatively high-functioning individuals.", "Interpretation of the French Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Fifth Edition (French WISC-V; Wechsler, 2016a) is based on a 5-factor model including Verbal Comprehension (VC), Visual Spatial (VS), Fluid Reasoning (FR), Working Memory (WM), and Processing Speed (PS). Evidence for the French WISC-V factorial structure was established exclusively through confirmatory factor analyses (CFAs). However, as recommended by Carroll (1995); Reise (2012), and Brown (2015), factorial structure should derive from both exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and CFA. The first goal of this study was to examine the factorial structure of the French WISC-V using EFA. The 15 French WISC-V primary and secondary subtest scaled scores intercorrelation matrix was used and factor extraction criteria suggested from 1 to 4 factors. To disentangle the contribution of first- and second-order factors, the Schmid and Leiman (1957) orthogonalization transformation (SLT) was applied. Overall, no EFA evidence for 5 factors was found. Results indicated that the g factor accounted for about 67% of the common variance and that the contributions of the first-order factors were weak (3.6 to 11.9%). CFA was used to test numerous alternative models. Results indicated that bifactor models produced better fit to these data than higher-order models. Consistent with previous studies, findings suggested dominance of the general intelligence factor and that users should thus emphasize the Full Scale IQ (FSIQ) when interpreting the French WISC-V.

Associations between these variables and residency performance were investigated through correlation and hierarchical regression analyses.\nCompletion of EQ, personality profiles, and SJT assessments.\nPerformance in residency as measured by a comprehensive performance metric. A score of zero represented a resident whose performance was consistent with that of their respective cohort's performance; below zero, worse performance; and greater than zero, better performance.\nOf the 61 eligible residents, 51 (84%) chose to participate and 22 (43%) were women. US Medical Licensing Examination Step 1 (USMLE1), but not USMLE2, emerged as a significant factor (t2,49\u2009=\u20091.98; \u03b2\u2009=\u20090.30; P\u2009=\u2009.03) associated with overall performance. Neither EQ facets nor overall EQ offered significant incremental validity over USMLE1 scores. Inclusion of the personality factors did not significantly alter the test statistic and did not explain any additional portion of the variance. By contrast, inclusion of SJT scores accounted for 15% more of the variance than USMLE1 scores alone, resulting in a total of 25% of the variance explained by both USMLE1 and SJT scores (F2,57\u2009=\u20097.47; P\u2009=\u2009.002). Both USMLE1 (t\u2009=\u20092.21; P\u2009=\u2009.03) and SJT scores (t\u2009=\u20092.97; P\u2009=\u2009.005) were significantly associated with overall resident performance.\nThis study found little support for the use of EQ assessment and only weak support for some distinct personality factors (ie, agreeableness, extraversion, and independence) in surgery resident selection. Performance on the SJT was associated with overall resident performance more than traditional cognitive measures (ie, USMLE scores). These data support further exploration of these 2 screening assessments on a larger scale across specialties and institutions.", "Self-concept is an individual's perception of him/herself. Research into the self-concept of children with cerebral palsy (CP) has been sparse due to the lack of a population-specific self-concept instrument. Using the new myTREEHOUSE Self-Concept Assessment, this study investigated the self-concept of children with CP in relation to age, gender, motor, communication and cognitive function. Children with CP aged 8-12 years (n\u202f=\u202f50; 29 males; mean 10 years 2 months; GMFCS-E&R I\u202f=\u202f36, II\u202f=\u202f8, III\u202f=\u202f5, IV\u202f=\u202f1) completed myTREEHOUSE and a standardised intelligence measure. Most children reported positive self-concept from all three myTREEHOUSE Performance Perspectives and over half (60%) fell within the Low range for the Personal Concern Score. Self-concept was not associated with age, gender, motor function, or communication function. However, for cognitive function, associations were observed for Social Skills (Below Average\u202f>\u202fAverage cognitive function; Cohen's d\u202f=\u202f1.07) and Learning Skills (Above Average\u202f>\u202fAverage cognitive function; Cohen's d\u202f=\u202f0.95) domains when rated from a Personal Performance Perspective. As the first study of the self-concept of children with CP using a CP-specific assessment, this study offers important insights into what children with CP think about themselves. Generally, the self-concept of children with CP was sound. Future research on environmental facilitators and barriers to robust self-concept development is recommended.", "An ongoing debate surrounds whether bilinguals outperform monolinguals in tests of executive processing. The aim of this study was to investigate if there are long-term (10 year) bilingual advantages in executive processing, as indexed by dual-task performance, in a sample that were 40-65 years at baseline. The bilingual (n = 24) and monolingual (n = 24) participants were matched on age, sex, education, fluid intelligence, and study sample. Participants performed free-recall for a 12-item list in three dual-task settings wherein they sorted cards either during encoding, retrieval, or during both encoding and retrieval of the word-list. Free recall without card sorting was used as a reference to compute dual-task costs. The results showed that bilinguals significantly outperformed monolinguals when they performed card-sorting during both encoding and retrieval of the word-list, the condition that presumably placed the highest demands on executive functioning. However, dual-task costs increased over time for bilinguals relative to monolinguals, a finding that is possibly influenced by retirement age and limited use of second language in the bilingual group.", "The objective of this study was to investigate the relationship between adiposity and cognition by using mean accuracy, mean reaction time, and intraindividual variability (IIV) among preadolescents.\nChildren 7 to 9 years old (N\u2009=\u2009233, 133 females) underwent dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry and a maximal oxygen consumption test to assess whole-body adiposity and aerobic fitness relative to fat-free mass (VO2 FF), respectively. Attentional inhibition was assessed by using a modified flanker task. IIV was assessed as standard deviation of reaction time and as a coefficient of variation of reaction time (CVRT). Hierarchical linear regression analyses were performed to examine the relationships between adiposity and cognitive measures following the adjustment of significant demographic factors, intelligence quotient, and VO2 FF.\nWhole-body adiposity was negatively related to congruent trial mean accuracy and reaction time and to CVRT in both the congruent and incongruent trials. Differences in cognitive function across weight status were selectively evident for measures of IIV, such that children with overweight/obesity (\u2265\u200985th BMI-for-age percentile) exhibited higher CVRT for both the congruent and incongruent trials.\nThis work provides additional evidence linking childhood obesity to poorer cognitive function and includes novel data extending the negative influence of adiposity to measures of intraindividual response variability in cognitive control, even after accounting for intellectual abilities, aerobic fitness, and demographic factors.", "Student feedback is often sought by educators in order to inform future developments in teaching or curriculum development. A lack of engagement with current feedback tools is thought, partly, to result from students perceiving no gain from the activity. The emotional adjective feedback tool (EAFT) is designed around the concept of emotional intelligence, where students feed back to tutors, after clinical teaching, by selecting and elaborating on emotional adjectives that describe their learning experiences. With a need to enhance and drive compassionate care, this emotional engagement might make the process of feedback more meaningful for students and may provide more useful feedback for staff.\nYear-1 medical students (n\u00a0=\u00a0115) completed the EAFT and a traditional feedback tool (TFT) after two clinical skills sessions. Using a questionnaire, they demonstrated their preference and explained their\u00a0reasoning. After the collection of student feedback using both tools, staff members (n\u00a0=\u00a012) in two focus groups reviewed the feedback and discussed their preferred tool if they were the tutor of that lesson.\nThematic analysis of both student and staff data demonstrated that EAFT provided\u00a0staff with information relating to teaching qualities and\u00a0the learning experience of\u00a0students.

The long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes of infants born full-term with low birth weight. Turk J Pediatr 2017; 59: 169-176. In this study, it was aimed to evaluate the neurological developments of pre-school or school-aged children together with their school successes, intelligence quotient and symptom severity of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder who were born at the 37th gestational week and above with birth weights below tenth percentile, which is called small for gestational age (SGA). A total of 74 patients with SGA and 75 healthy children were evaluated. The patients were evaluated by child neurologist and child psychiatrist. Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised, Ankara Developmental Screening Inventory, and The Turgay DSM-IV-Based Child and Adolescent Disruptive Behavioral Disorders Screening and Rating Scale (T-DSM-IV-S) were applied according to their age groups. SGA cases had been breastfed for shorter durations (p: 0.004), had walked later (p < 0.001), talked later (p < 0.001), and had encountered more vision disorders (p: 0.009) than the control group. SGA cases were determined to encounter febrile convulsions more frequently (p: 0.007). SGA cases were determined to exhibit lower school success (p < 0.001), were diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder more frequently (p < 0.001), and their mental developments were delayed (p < 0.001). In cases with SGA, inattention (p: 0.004) and conduct disorder (p: 0.029) subscales and the total scale scores (p: 0.022) of T-DSM-IV-S were significantly lower when compared to the control group. We consider that being SGA may have a negative impact on child`s behavior, attention and academic achievement in long-term.", "This paper surveys the literature on forensic face recognition (FFR), with a particular focus on the strength of evidence as used in a court of law. FFR is the use of biometric face recognition for several applications in forensic science. It includes scenarios of ID verification and open-set identification, investigation and intelligence, and evaluation of the strength of evidence. We present FFR from operational, tactical, and strategic perspectives. We discuss criticism of FFR and we provide an overview of research efforts from multiple perspectives that relate to the domain of FFR. Finally, we sketch possible future directions for FFR.", "The current study investigated the direct and indirect relations between basic linguistic skills (i.e., phonological skills and grammatical ability) and advanced linguistic skills (i.e., academic vocabulary and verbal reasoning), on the one hand, and fifth-grade mathematics (i.e., arithmetic, geometry, and fractions), on the other, taking working memory and general intelligence into account and controlling for socioeconomic status, age, and gender. The results showed the basic linguistic representations of 167 fifth graders to be indirectly related to their geometric and fraction skills via arithmetic. Furthermore, advanced linguistic skills were found to be directly related to geometry and fractions after controlling for arithmetic. It can be concluded that linguistic skills directly and indirectly relate to mathematical ability in the upper grades of primary education, which highlights the importance of paying attention to such skills in the school curriculum.", "Decisions concerning additional surgery after endoscopic resection of T1 colorectal cancer (CRC) are difficult because preoperative prediction of lymph node metastasis (LNM) is problematic. We investigated whether artificial intelligence can predict LNM presence, thus minimizing the need for additional surgery.\nData on 690 consecutive patients with T1 CRCs that were surgically resected in 2001\u200a-\u200a2016 were retrospectively analyzed. We divided patients into two groups according to date: data from 590 patients were used for machine learning for the artificial intelligence model, and the remaining 100 patients were included for model validation. The artificial intelligence model analyzed 45 clinicopathological factors and then predicted positivity or negativity for LNM. Operative specimens were used as the gold standard for the presence of LNM. The artificial intelligence model was validated by calculating the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for predicting LNM, and comparing these data with those of the American, European, and Japanese guidelines.\nSensitivity was 100\u200a% (95\u200a% confidence interval [CI] 72\u200a% to 100\u200a%) in all models. Specificity of the artificial intelligence model and the American, European, and Japanese guidelines was 66\u200a% (95\u200a%CI 56\u200a% to 76\u200a%), 44\u200a% (95\u200a%CI 34\u200a% to 55\u200a%), 0\u200a% (95\u200a%CI 0\u200a% to 3\u200a%), and 0\u200a% (95\u200a%CI 0\u200a% to 3\u200a%), respectively; and accuracy was 69\u200a% (95\u200a%CI 59\u200a% to 78\u200a%), 49\u200a% (95\u200a%CI 39\u200a% to 59\u200a%), 9\u200a% (95\u200a%CI 4\u200a% to 16\u200a%), and 9\u200a% (95\u200a%CI 4\u200a%\u200a-\u200a16\u200a%), respectively. The rates of unnecessary additional surgery attributable to misdiagnosing LNM-negative patients as having LNM were: 77\u200a% (95\u200a%CI 62\u200a% to 89\u00a0%) for the artificial intelligence model, and 85\u200a% (95\u200a%CI 73\u200a% to 93\u200a%; P\u200a<\u200a0.001), 91\u200a% (95\u200a%CI 84\u200a% to 96\u200a%; P\u200a<\u200a0.001), and 91\u200a% (95\u200a%CI 84\u200a% to 96\u200a%; P\u200a<\u200a0.001) for the American, European, and Japanese guidelines, respectively.\nCompared with current guidelines, artificial intelligence significantly reduced unnecessary additional surgery after endoscopic resection of T1 CRC without missing LNM positivity.", "In this study, the authors reviewed domestic and foreign literatures, conducted the textual research on origin and development of Cassia Semen, studied records in ancient books and ancient and modern literatures, clinical adverse reactions and relevant experimental studies in recent years, and summarized the clinical features and influencing factors related to the safety of Cassiae Semen. According to the findings,Cassia Semen's safety risks are mainly liver and kidney system damages, with the main clinical features of fatigue, anorexia, disgusting of oil, yellow urine and gray stool; digestive system injury, with the main clinical features of diarrhea, abdominal distension, nausea and loose stool; reproductive system damage, with the main clinical features of vaginal bleeding. Allergic reactions and clinical adverse events, with the main clinical features for numb mouth, itching skin, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, wheezing and lip cyanosis were also reported. The toxicological studies on toxic components of Cassiae Semen obtusifolia were carried out through acute toxicity test, subacute toxicity test, subchronic toxicity test and chronic toxicity test. Risk factors might include patients, compatibility and physicians. Physicians should strictly abide by the medication requirements in the Pharmacopoeia, pay attention to rational compatibility, appropriate dosage,correct usage and appropriate processing, control the dosage below 15 g to avoid excessive intake, strictly control the course of treatment to avoid accumulated poisoning caused by long-term administration. At the same time, clinicians should pay attention to the latest research progress, update the knowledge structure, quickly find the latest and useful materials from clinical practice, scientific research and drug information and other literatures, make evaluation and judgment for the materials, establish a traditional Chinese medicine intelligence information library, and strengthen the control over adverse effects with a pre-warning consciousness. The authors suggested standardizing clinical medication of Cassiae Semen, and avoiding misuse or excessive use; clinicians should prescribe it in strict accordance with there commended usage and dosage in the Pharmacopoeia, and focus on the safety signal accumulation in clinic, while strengthening studies for toxic substance basis and toxicity mechanism, in order to give full play to Cassiae Semen's clinical efficacy and reduce its adverse reactions.", "Reduced graphene oxide-supported nanoscale zero-valent iron (nZVI/rGO) magnetic nanocomposites were prepared and then applied in the Cu(II) removal from aqueous solutions. Scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and superconduction quantum interference device magnetometer were performed to characterize the nZVI/rGO nanocomposites. In order to reduce the number of experiments and the economic cost, response surface methodology (RSM) combined with artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, such as artificial neural network (ANN), genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO), has been utilized as a major tool that can model and optimize the removal processes, because a tremendous advance has recently been made on AI that may result in extensive applications. Based on RSM, ANN-GA and ANN-PSO were employed to model the Cu(II) removal process and optimize the operating parameters, e.g., operating temperature, initial pH, initial concentration and contact time. The ANN-PSO model was proven to be an effective tool for modeling and optimizing the Cu(II) removal with a low absolute error and a high removal efficiency. Furthermore, the isotherm, kinetic, thermodynamic studies and the XPS analysis were performed to explore the mechanisms of Cu(II) removal process.", "Fluoride is an essential microelement for human health. Statistically, smaller quantities (<1.0\u00a0mg/L) in drinking water are usually considered to have a beneficial effect on the rate of occurrence of dental caries, particularly among children, but excessive continuous exposure (>1.5\u00a0mg/L) to fluoride can give rise to a number of adverse effects, including dental fluorosis, skeletal fluorosis, increased rate of bone fractures, decreased birth rates, increased rate of urolithiasis (kidney stones), impaired thyroid function, and impaired development of intelligence in children [1], [2], [3], [4], [5]. The data suggested that the north-eastern part of the Basara region having high fluoride concentration, which is unsuitable for drinking purposes. Hence, this unsuitable drinking water cause fluorosis in this Basara and surrounding villages, and especially based on the findings suggests, where the fluoride levels are in below maximum permissible limits that water ingests to the people to avoid further fluorosis.", "This retrospective cohort study compared real-world clinical and healthcare-resource utilization (HCRU) data in patients with type 2 diabetes using basal insulin (BI) who switched to insulin glargine 300 units/mL (Gla-300) or another BI. Data from the Predictive Health Intelligence Environment database 12 months before (baseline) and 6 months after (follow-up) the switch date (index date, March 1, 2015 to May 31, 2016) included glycated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), hypoglycaemia, HCRU and associated costs. Baseline characteristics were balanced using propensity score matching. Change in HbA1c from baseline was similar in both matched cohorts (n = 1819 in each). Hypoglycaemia incidence and adjusted event rate were significantly lower with Gla-300. Patients switching to Gla-300 had a significantly lower incidence of HCRU related to hypoglycaemia. All-cause and diabetes-related hospitalization and emergency-department HCRU were also favourable for Gla-300. Lower HCRU translated to lower costs in patients using Gla-300. In this real-world study, switching to Gla-300 reduced the risk of hypoglycaemia in patients with type 2 diabetes when compared with those switching to another BI, resulting in less HCRU and potential savings of associated costs.", "There has been mixed evidence for age differences in wisdom-related knowledge across the adult life span. This study investigated two potential moderators of the link between age and wisdom-related knowledge: the wisdom criteria and the wisdom tasks.\nTo test these moderators, 40 younger and 40 older participants completed four wisdom tasks differing in context-richness. Independent trained raters coded the resulting think-aloud protocols in terms of value relativism, as defined in the Berlin wisdom paradigm, and perspective taking, as defined by Grossmann.\nThe type of task did not show any main or interaction effects on the present two wisdom criteria. However, age differences in the two wisdom criteria were multidirectional: whereas perspective taking did not differ by age group, value relativism was lower in older than younger adults. In addition, value relativism, but not perspective taking, was related to measures of fluid and crystallized intelligence, whereas perspective taking, but not value relativism, was related to a measure of life investment.\nThis study provides evidence for the idea that value relativism and perspective taking are two distinct facets of wisdom-related knowledge. Implications for future age-comparative research interested in wisdom are discussed.", "This study is an evaluation of cognitive functioning in formerly opioid-dependent adults after at least 1 year of abstinence. Participants (45 formerly opioid-dependent patients, referred to as abstainers, and 45 matched healthy controls) completed a structured screening and subsequent cognitive test battery covering intelligence, learning and memory, attention, and executive functions. Many cognitive functions were comparable between long-term abstainers and healthy controls, and we found few relevant differences. Long-term abstainers seem to have subtle deficits in recognition performance. Based on our and earlier findings, opioid maintenance treatment may be seen as relatively safe with respect to cognitive dysfunction and cognitive functioning is of great relevance for the rehabilitation and daily functioning of substance-dependent people.", "To provide effective treatment to clients, speech-language pathologists must be understood, and be perceived to demonstrate the personal qualities necessary for therapeutic practice (e.g., resourcefulness and empathy). One factor that could interfere with the listener's perception of non-native speech is the speaker's accent. The current study explored the relationship between how accurately listeners could understand non-native speech and their perceptions of personal attributes of the speaker. Additionally, this study investigated how listeners' familiarity and experience with other languages may influence their perceptions of non-native accented speech.\nThrough an online survey, native monolingual and bilingual English listeners rated four non-native accents (i.e., Spanish, Chinese, Russian, and Indian) on perceived intelligibility and perceived personal qualities (i.e., professionalism, intelligence, resourcefulness, empathy, and patience) necessary for speech-language pathologists.\nThe results indicated significant relationships between the perception of intelligibility and the perception of personal qualities (i.e., professionalism, intelligence, and resourcefulness) attributed to non-native speakers. However, these findings were not supported for the Chinese accent. Bilingual listeners judged the non-native speech as more intelligible in comparison to monolingual listeners. No significant differences were found in the ratings between bilingual listeners who share the same language background as the speaker and other bilingual listeners.\nBased on the current findings, greater perception of intelligibility was the key to promoting a positive perception of personal qualities such as professionalism, intelligence, and resourcefulness, important for speech-language pathologists. The current study found evidence to support the claim that bilinguals have a greater ability in understanding non-native accented speech compared to monolingual listeners. The results, however, did not confirm an advantage for bilingual listeners sharing the same language backgrounds with the non-native speaker over other bilingual listeners.", "OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to characterize the association between percentage change in hemoglobin (\u0394Hb)-i.e., the difference between preoperative Hb and in-hospital nadir Hb concentration-and perioperative adverse events among spine surgery patients. METHODS Patients who underwent spine surgery at the authors' institution between December 4, 2008, and June 26, 2015, were eligible for this retrospective study. Patients who underwent the following procedures were included: atlantoaxial fusion, subaxial anterior cervical fusion, subaxial posterior cervical fusion, anterior lumbar fusion, posterior lumbar fusion, lateral lumbar fusion, excision of intervertebral disc, and excision of spinal cord lesion. Data on intraoperative transfusion were obtained from an automated, prospectively collected, anesthesia data management system. Data on postoperative hospital transfusions were obtained through an Internet-based intelligence portal. Percentage \u0394Hb was defined as: ([preoperative Hb - nadir Hb]/preoperative Hb) \u00d7 100. Clinical outcomes included in-hospital morbidity and length of stay associated with percentage \u0394Hb. RESULTS A total of 3949 patients who underwent spine surgery were identified. Of these, 1204 patients (30.5%) received at least 1 unit of packed red blood cells. The median nadir Hb level was 10.6 g/dl (interquartile range 8.7-12.4 g/dl), yielding a mean percentage \u0394Hb of 23.6% (SD 15.4%). Perioperative complications occurred in 234 patients (5.9%) and were more common in patients with a larger percentage \u0394Hb (p = 0.017). Hospital-related infection, which occurred in 60 patients (1.5%), was also more common in patients with greater percentage \u0394Hb (p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS Percentage \u0394Hb is independently associated with a higher risk of developing any perioperative complication and hospital-related infection. The authors' results suggest that percentage \u0394Hb may be a useful measure for identifying patients at risk for adverse perioperative events.", "To clarify the optimal cumulative cisplatin dose (CCD) in locoregionally-advanced nasopharyngel carcinoma (NPC) patients receiving induction chemotherapy (IC) plus concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT). Using the NPC-specific database from the established big-data intelligence platform at Sun Yat-Sen University Cancer Center, 583 non-disseminated, locoregionally-advanced NPC patients receiving IC plus CCRT were enrolled. Propensity score matching (PSM) analysis was conducted to control for confounding factors. The median CCD was 160 mg/m2 after IC (range, 40-300 mg/m2 ); only 74 patients (12.7%) achieved CCD >200 mg/m2 . Patients receiving >200 mg/m2 CCD did not show significantly improved 5-year overall survival (OS) (HR = 1.19; 95% confidence intervals [CI] 0.69-2.06, P = .53) and progression-free survival (PFS) (HR = 1.03; 95% CI: 0.63-1.68, P = .92) compared with patients receiving <200 mg/m2 CCD. Further investigations of the potential of median CCD (160 mg/m2 ) to yield survival benefits revealed that there were no significant differences in survival endpoints between patients receiving CCD >160 mg/m2 and CCD < 160 mg/m2 in both the original and PSM cohorts. In addition, subgroup analysis indicated a favorable PFS, but not OS, with higher cisplatin administration in patients with pretreatment Epstein-Barr virus deoxyribonucleic acid (EBV DNA) <1000 copies/mL (HR = 0.26, 95% CI: 0.07-0.93, P = .03) and receiving <3 IC cycles (HR = 0.59, 95% CI 0.33-1.07, P = .08). Our analysis of real world data provided references for the optimal CCD in locoregionally-advanced NPC receiving additional IC. The causal relationship between 200 mg/m2 CCD and improved survival was not defined; 160 mg/m2 CCD might be enough. However, for patients with EBV DNA <1000 copy/mL and receiving <3 IC cycles, a higher dose might be necessary.", "A previous meta-analysis (Van der Linden et al., Psychol Bull 143:36-52, 2017) showed that the General Factor of Personality (GFP) overlaps with ability as well as trait emotional intelligence (EI). The correlation between trait EI and the GFP was so high (\u03c1\u2009=\u20090.88) in that meta-analysis that these two may be considered virtually identical constructs. The present study builds on these findings by examining whether the strong phenotypic correlation between the GFP and trait EI has a genetic component. In a sample of monozygotic and dizygotic twins, the heritability estimates for the GFP and trait EI were 53 and 45%, respectively. Moreover, there was a strong genetic correlation of r\u2009=\u2009.90 between the GFP and trait EI. Additional analyses suggested that a substantial proportion of the genetic correlations reflects non-additive genetic effects (e.g., dominance and epistasis). These findings are discussed in light of evolutionary accounts of the GFP.", "Verbal memory impairment is a core feature in schizophrenia even at early stages of the disease, but its etiopathogenesis is not fully understood. The APOE-\u03b54 is the main genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease. Our primary goal was to ascertain whether APOE-\u03b54 status had a pleiotropic effect in early stages of the illness.\nA total of 86 first-episode psychosis (FEP) outpatients and 39 healthy volunteers were recruited. Demographic and clinical data, APOE genotyping, and a neuropsychological test battery including the California Verbal Learning Test - second edition (CVLT-II) were administered and assessed at study entry and at 1-year follow-up. Data were analyzed using mixed-model repeated measures, where the dependent variable was verbal memory indexed by California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT) Trials 1-5 total recall score.\nFEP-APOE-\u03b54 carriers and FEP-APOE-\u03b54 noncarriers had similar symptom severity, clinical outcomes, premorbid and current intelligence quotient, and exposure to antipsychotics. There was a main effect of group on CVLT 1-5 (FEP =43.30 vs control =58.25; F[1, 119.7]=42.97; P<0.001) as well as an APOE-\u03b54 by group by time (F[4, 116.2]=2.73, P=0.033) interaction with only FEP-APOE-\u03b54 carriers showing improved verbal memory at follow-up.\nOur study is the first to report improvement in verbal memory in persons afflicted by FEP who are APOE-\u03b54 carriers and replicates the prominent verbal memory deficits present in FEP. Our work provides further evidence pointing to an antagonistic pleiotropic effect of APOE-\u03b54 in neuropsychiatric disorders. Our results merit further research into antagonistic pleiotropic effects in schizophrenia.", "Multiple studies have reported that individuals with low birth weights (LBW, <2500\u2009g) have a lower intelligence quotient (IQ) than those with normal birth weights (NBW, \u22652500\u2009g). Based on 57 eligible individual studies including 12,137 participants, we performed a meta-analysis to estimate the association between low birth weight and individuals' IQ scores (IQs). The pooled weight mean difference (WMD) in IQs between NBW and LBW individuals was 10 (95% CI 9.26-11.68). The WMD was stable regardless of age. No publication bias was detected. The mean IQs of the extremely low birth weight (ELBW, <1000\u2009g), very low birth weight (VLBW, 1000-1499\u2009g), moderately low birth weight (MLBW, 1500-2499\u2009g) and NBW individuals were 91, 94, 99 and 104, respectively. Additionally, the WMD in IQs with NBW were 14, 10 and 7 for ELBW, VLBW, and MLBW individuals, respectively. Two studies permitted estimates of the influence of social determinants of health to the discrepancy in IQs, which was 13%. Since IQ is inherited and influenced by environmental factors, parental IQs and other factors contribute to residual confounding of the results. As the conclusion was based on population studies, it may not be applicable to a single individual.", "The fact that tyrosine increases dopamine availability that, in turn, may enhance cognitive performance has led to numerous studies on healthy young participants taking tyrosine as a food supplement. As a result of this dietary intervention, participants show performance increases in working memory and executive functions. However, the potential association between habitual dietary tyrosine intake and cognitive performance has not been investigated to date. The present study aims at clarifying the association of episodic memory (EM), working memory (WM) and fluid intelligence (Gf), and tyrosine intake in younger and older adults. To this end, we acquired habitual tyrosine intake (food frequency questionnaire) from 1724 participants of the Berlin Aging Study II (1383 older adults, 341 younger adults) and modelled its relations to cognitive performance assessed in a broad battery of cognitive tasks using structural equation modeling. We observed a significant association between tyrosine intake and the latent factor capturing WM, Gf, and EM in the younger and the older sample. Due to partial strong factorial invariance between age groups for a confirmatory factor analysis on cognitive performance, we were able to compare the relationship between tyrosine and cognition between age groups and found no difference. Above and beyond previous studies on tyrosine food supplementation the present result extend this to a cross-sectional association between habitual tyrosine intake levels in daily nutrition and cognitive performance (WM, Gf, and EM). This corroborates nutritional recommendations that are thus far derived from single-dose administration studies.", "Approximately 55% of patients with neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) show cognitive impairment as evaluated using the Rao Brief Repeatable Neuropsychological Battery (BRBN), but this frequency appears to be higher than the frequency of specific brain lesions in NMOSD.\nWe studied whether cognitive impairment could be observed in NMOSD patients with no or minor non-specific brain lesions.\nWe evaluated cognitive function in 12 NMOSD and 14 MS patients using the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-III (WAIS-III), the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised (WMS-R), and the BRBN. We judged as cognitively impaired patients whose scores were below the average by 2 standard deviations or greater in 2 or more cognitive domains.\nCognitive impairment was observed in 5 MS patients (35.7%) and in the only NMOSD patient (8.3%) with symptomatic brain lesions, but not in the other NMOSD patients who had no or minor non-specific brain lesions. Meanwhile, 5 NMOSD (41.7%) and 4 MS (28.6%) patients who had normal cognition according to the WAIS-III and WMS-R were assessed as cognitively impaired by the BRBN (which is not standardized for age).\nCognitive function in NMOSD patients with no or mild non-specific brain lesions was preserved according to the WAIS-III and WMS-R.", "Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) is becoming a next-generation tool for the diagnosis of human disease. CAD for colon polyps has been suggested as a particularly useful tool for trainee colonoscopists, as the use of a CAD system avoids the complications associated with endoscopic resections. In addition to conventional CAD, a convolutional neural network (CNN) system utilizing artificial intelligence (AI) has been developing rapidly over the past 5 years. We attempted to generate a unique CNN-CAD system with an AI function that studied endoscopic images extracted from movies obtained with colonoscopes used in routine examinations. Here, we report our preliminary results of this novel CNN-CAD system for the diagnosis of colon polyps.\nA total of 1,200 images from cases of colonoscopy performed between January 2010 and December 2016 at Kindai University Hospital were used. These images were extracted from the video of actual endoscopic examinations. Additional video images from 10 cases of unlearned processes were retrospectively assessed in a pilot study. They were simply diagnosed as either an adenomatous or nonadenomatous polyp.\nThe number of images used by AI to learn to distinguish adenomatous from nonadenomatous was 1,200:600. These images were extracted from the videos of actual endoscopic examinations. The size of each image was adjusted to 256 \u00d7 256 pixels. A 10-hold cross-validation was carried out. The accuracy of the 10-hold cross-validation is 0.751, where the accuracy is the ratio of the number of correct answers over the number of all the answers produced by the CNN. The decisions by the CNN were correct in 7 of 10 cases.\nA CNN-CAD system using routine colonoscopy might be useful for the rapid diagnosis of colorectal polyp classification. Further prospective studies in an in vivo setting are required to confirm the effectiveness of a CNN-CAD system in routine colonoscopy.", "The present study aimed to develop the thinking maps training package and compare its training effect with the thinking maps method on the reading performance of second and fifth grade of elementary school male dyslexic students. For this mixed method exploratory study, from among the above mentioned grades' students in Isfahan, 90\u00a0students who met the inclusion criteria were selected by multistage sampling and randomly assigned into six experimental and control groups. The data were collected by reading and dyslexia test and Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-fourth edition. The results of covariance analysis indicated a significant difference between the reading performance of the experimental (thinking maps training package and thinking maps method groups) and control groups ([Formula: see text]). Moreover, there were significant differences between the thinking maps training package group and thinking maps method group in some of the subtests ([Formula: see text]). It can be concluded that thinking maps training package and the thinking maps method exert a positive influence on the reading performance of dyslexic students; therefore, thinking maps can be used as an effective training and treatment method.", "Deep brain stimulation of the nucleus basalis of Meynert (NBM DBS) has been proposed as a treatment option for Parkinson disease dementia.\nTo evaluate the safety and potential symptomatic effects of NBM DBS in patients with Parkinson disease dementia.\nA randomized, double-blind, crossover clinical trial evaluated the results of 6 patients with Parkinson disease dementia who were treated with NBM DBS at a neurosurgical referral center in the United Kingdom from October 26, 2012, to July 31, 2015. Eligible patients met the diagnostic criteria for Parkinson disease dementia, had motor fluctuations, were appropriate surgical candidates aside from the coexistence of dementia, were age 35 to 80 years, were able to give informed consent, had a Mini-Mental State Examination score of 21 to 26, had minimal atrophy seen on results of brain magnetic resonance imaging, and lived at home with a caregiver-informant.\nAfter surgery, patients were assigned to receive either active stimulation (bilateral, low-frequency [20 Hz] NBM DBS) or sham stimulation for 6 weeks, followed by the opposite condition for 6 weeks.\nThe primary outcome was the difference in scores on each item of an abbreviated cognitive battery (California Verbal Learning Test-II, Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-III digit span, verbal fluency, Posner covert attention test, and simple and choice reaction times) between the 2 conditions. Secondary outcomes were exploratory and included differences in scores on standardized measurements of cognitive, psychiatric, and motor symptoms and resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging.\nSurgery and stimulation were well tolerated by all 6 patients (all men; mean [SD] age, 65.2 [10.7] years), with no serious adverse events during the trial. No consistent improvements were observed in the primary cognitive outcomes or in results of resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging. An improvement in scores on the Neuropsychiatric Inventory was observed with NBM DBS (8.5 points [range, 4-26 points]) compared with sham stimulation (12 points [range, 8-38 points]; median difference, 5 points; 95% CI, 2.5-8.5 points; P\u2009=\u2009.03) and the preoperative baseline (13 points [range, 5-25 points]; median difference, 2 points; 95% CI, -8 to 5.5 points; P\u2009=\u2009.69).\nLow-frequency NBM DBS was safely conducted in patients with Parkinson disease dementia; however, no improvements were observed in the primary cognitive outcomes. Further studies may be warranted to explore its potential to improve troublesome neuropsychiatric symptoms.\nclinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT01701544.", "The Digit Span subscale (Digit Span Forward, Backward, and Sequencing combined composite) internal inconsistency reliability has been reported at .93, based on a coefficient known as stratified coefficient alpha. With accessible examples, we demonstrate that stratified coefficient alpha can deviate substantially from a model-based internal consistency reliability that represents an underlying dimension, that is, omega hierarchical. Next, we simulated item-level Digit Span subscale data to correspond very closely to the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-fourth edition normative sample. Based on omega hierarchical, we estimated the internal consistency reliability associated with the Digit Span subscale scores at .74. In light of the results, clinicians are cautioned against interpreting Digit Span subscale scores. Instead, interpretations should probably be restricted to the Digit Span Forward, Digit Span Backward, and Digit Span Sequencing test scores. Finally, we offer suggestions for improvement to achieve higher levels of Digit Span subscale score reliability.", "The current study examined the relationship between emotional intelligence, personality disorder traits, and college adjustment.\nA sample of 246 first-semester, first-time freshmen (73.6% female, age mean\u00a0=\u00a018.7, standard deviation\u00a0=\u00a02.0) at a large university in the Eastern United States completed the Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire (Petrides, 2009), the Schedule for Nonadaptive and Adaptive Personality-2 (Clark, Simms, Wu, & Casillas, 2014), and the Student Adaptation to College Questionnaire (Baker & Siryk, 1998).\nAs predicted, personality disorder symptoms and emotional intelligence were generally related, and both were related to adjustment. Unique patterns of association between traits reflecting personality disorder clusters and emotional intelligence deficits also emerged. Contrary to expectation, however, emotional intelligence did not moderate the relationship between personality disorders and adjustment.\nThe results suggest an alternative model implicating emotional intelligence as a mediator of the relationship between personality difficulties and college adjustment.", "Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Fourth Edition (WAIS-IV) Reliable Digit Span (RDS), RDS-revised (RDS-R), and age-corrected scaled score (ACSS) are validated and commonly used embedded performance validity tests (PVTs), though existing validation studies have largely examined younger (approximate ages 19-35) patients with mild traumatic brain injury or those without cognitive impairment. This study compared the classification accuracy of RDS, RDS-R, and ACSS in a mixed clinical sample of relatively older (M age\u00a0=\u00a054.61) veterans with and without neurocognitive impairment.\nDuring a comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation, 113 clinically-referred veterans completed the WAIS-IV Digit Span subtest and the following criterion PVTs: Dot Counting Test, Word Choice Test, and Test of Memory Malingering. Those with\u00a0\u22641 criterion PVT failure were classified as valid (n\u00a0=\u00a087), whereas those with\u00a0\u22652 failures were classified as noncredible (n\u00a0=\u00a026). Among valid participants, 49% were cognitively impaired.\nRDS, RDS-R, and ACSS all significantly predicted validity group membership with respective areas under the curve (AUCs) of .79, .81, and .85, and optimal cut scores of RDS\u00a0\u2264\u00a05, RDS-R\u00a0\u2264\u00a09, and ACSS\u00a0\u2264\u00a05. Lower accuracy and AUCs were observed for the valid-cognitively impaired subsample across indices, but to a greater degree for traditional RDS. ACSS evidenced maximal sensitivity/specificity for the total sample (\u22645; .62/.87), cognitively unimpaired subsample (\u22645; .62/.95), and cognitively impaired subsample (\u22644; .39/.86).\nACSS yielded better classification accuracy and sensitivity/specificity than RDS and RDS-R. While all three indices have utility as embedded PVTs, ACSS\u00a0\u2264\u00a05 may be most robust to cognitive impairment while identifying noncredible performance.", "Dysfunctional expectations are considered to be core features of various mental disorders. Clinical observations suggest that people suffering from mental disorders such as major depression tend to maintain dysfunctional expectations despite expectation-disconfirming evidence. Surprisingly, this clinically relevant phenomenon has not yet sufficiently been investigated in empirical studies. Therefore, we developed an experimental paradigm to investigate expectation change vs. maintenance, and the first step to test its validity is to apply it in healthy individuals.\nAfter conducting two pilot studies (n\u202f=\u202f28; n\u202f=\u202f37), the present study systematically examined whether it is possible to change healthy individuals' (n\u202f=\u202f102) task-specific and generalized performance expectations through expectation-disconfirming experiences. Using a standardized instruction, we initially induced non-positive expectations regarding participants' ability to successfully work on an unknown test. Then, participants received standardized performance feedback that either confirmed or disconfirmed their expectations before assessing participants' expectations again after completing the Test for the Measure of Emotional Intelligence.\nResults indicate that expectation-disconfirming feedback led to a significant change of both task-specific and generalized performance expectations. There was no expectation change in the expectation-confirming condition.\nAs the present study examined expectation change among healthy individuals, the next step is to apply this paradigm in a clinical sample and to examine whether expectation change is less likely among people suffering from depression or other mental disorders characterized by dysfunctional expectations.\nFocusing more rigorously on expectation maintenance among people with mental disorders could enable therapists to develop expectation-focused interventions aiming at enhancing expectation change.", "The purpose of this study was to examine cognitive functioning in people following first-episode mania relative to a demographically similar healthy control group.\nForty-one patients, who had recently stabilised from a first manic episode, and twenty-one healthy controls, were compared in an extensive cognitive assessment.\nFirst-episode mania participants had significantly lower Full-Scale IQ (FSIQ) relative to healthy controls; however, this finding could be driven by premorbid differences in intellectual functioning. There were no significant differences between groups in Verbal IQ (VIQ) and Performance IQ (PIQ). First-episode mania participants performed significantly poorer than healthy controls in processing speed, verbal learning and memory, working memory, and cognitive flexibility with medium-to-large effects. There were no group differences in other measures of cognition.\nParticipants following first-episode mania have poorer global intelligence than healthy controls, and have cognitive difficulties in some, but not all areas of cognitive functioning. This highlights the importance of early intervention and cognitive assessment in the early course of the disorder.", "'Emotion work' is a term used to describe the emotional responses that may arise in qualitative research exploring difficult experiences. Parents' experiences of neonatal care can raise sensitive issues during interviews, which may lead to emotional responses.\nTo reflect on an interpretive study involving narrative interviews with parents of preterm neonates, to inform researchers about the potential emotive issues that may arise in such work.\nReflection on interviews with parents of preterm neonates revealed areas for discussion relating to emotion work, the role of the researcher, emotional connections and empathic interviewing. Consideration of these areas highlights the importance of reflexivity for researchers.\nQualitative researchers undertaking narrative interviews should be prepared for emotive issues that arise and recognise the need for emotional intelligence. Achieving a balance between being an empathic, emotionally aware interviewer and remaining objective can be challenging.\nStrategies that researchers can use to address this balance and to manage the emotion work involved in research of this nature are provided.", "No-limit Texas hold'em is the most popular form of poker. Despite artificial intelligence (AI) successes in perfect-information games, the private information and massive game tree have made no-limit poker difficult to tackle. We present Libratus, an AI that, in a 120,000-hand competition, defeated four top human specialist professionals in heads-up no-limit Texas hold'em, the leading benchmark and long-standing challenge problem in imperfect-information game solving. Our game-theoretic approach features application-independent techniques: an algorithm for computing a blueprint for the overall strategy, an algorithm that fleshes out the details of the strategy for subgames that are reached during play, and a self-improver algorithm that fixes potential weaknesses that opponents have identified in the blueprint strategy.", "This \"What's new in instrumental dermatology\" dedicated skin surgeryis based upon a 2015-2017 literature analysis. The excision of skin cancers is an important part of surgical dermatology. Will artificial intelligence and new drug be able to face the increasing need for therapy? Wrong-site surgery is due to multiple factors. Photographs of biopsy site and short time between biopsy and surgery decrease postponement of surgery and wrong-site surgery. Noninvasive imaging technologies are improving and help to delineate skin tumors and increase the probability of complete tumor removal. They are beginning to be an essential tool for skin surgery. The 2005 recommendations for the management of melanoma stages I to III have been updated in 2016. The Slow-Mohs technique is the better way to treat dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans whose sub-clinical invasion is often asymmetric and unpredictable. Wide local excision for the treatment of severe hidradenitis suppurativa improves the quality of life and decreases recurrence rate. Cutaneous surgery is considered as safe procedures with a low risk of complications. Postoperative bleedings are the most frequent. Anti-thrombotics enhance the risk, but must not be stopped or bridged, except the novel oral anticoagulants which can be interrupted 24h before surgery and started again a few hours after. The risk of surgical site infections is low in dermatologic surgery. Most recommended measures to prevent them have been extrapolated from other types of surgery and the level of evidence is low. The reconstruction of skin defect must be adapted on size and location. A birhombic transposition flap is reliable in case of a defect too large to be repaired by a single flap. Full-thickness skin graft is a safe option to repair defect on the external ear.", "This paper builds different neural network models with simple topologies, having one or two hidden layers which were subsequently employed in the prediction of ocular changes progression in patients with diabetes associated with primer open-angle glaucoma.\nFor attempting to indicate whether there is a relationship between glaucoma and diabetes, a simulation method, based on artificial neural networks (ANN), Jordan Elman networks (JEN) type, in particular, was applied in conjunction with clinical observation. The study was conducted on a sample of 101 eyes with open angle glaucoma included and, in each case, the patients had associated diabetes mellitus. A high degree of accuracy was exhibited by the models, demonstrating the potential effectiveness of this artificial intelligence technique for predicting ocular changes associated with diabetes. The parameters considered in this study for modelling purpose were: glaucoma age, diabetes age, C/D ratio (cup/disk size), glycated haemoglobin level (HbA1c), intraocular pressure (IOP), patient age, mean deviation (MD) and LENS appearance.\nRelatively simple models, feed-forward neural networks with one or two intermediate layers, provided clinically meaningful data in direct modelling, the probability of correct answers being of 95%. Inverse modelling was also performed, in which MD depreciation was the output parameter. High accuracy was exhibited, in this case, with Jordan Elman networks, with the confidence interval of \u00b115%.\nThe neural models have demonstrated the possibility of their use in successfully predicting the relationship between glaucoma and diabetes in a real clinical environment.", "General anesthesia has been linked to impaired brain development in immature animals and young children. In this study the influence of orthopedic surgery under general anesthesia on the intelligence of school age children has been evaluated.\nA total of 209 subjects aged 6-12\u00a0years were recruited and allocated into 4 groups according to the duration of general anesthesia, including a control group (n\u2009=\u200930), short (< 1\u00a0h, n\u2009=\u200949), moderate- (1-3\u00a0h, n\u2009=\u200951) and long-duration groups (> 3\u00a0h, n\u2009=\u200979), respectively. The intelligence quotient (IQ) of the subjects was measured by the Raven's Standard Progressive Matrices (RSPM) before and after orthopedic surgery under general anesthesia of various durations (vide supra).\nThe IQ score decreased significantly in the long-duration group at 1\u00a0month post-operation compared with the pre-operation score (P\u2009<\u20090.001), and IQ did not recover completely at 3\u00a0months postoperatively (P\u2009<\u20090.05), but had recovered when measured at the 1-year follow-up. Moreover, this study showed that the development of children's intelligence was affected by the exposure time to anesthetics at a younger age (OR\u2009=\u20095.26, 95% CI:2.70-8.41, P\u2009<\u20090.001), having a mother with a low education level (OR\u2009=\u20092.71, 95% CI:1.24-6.14, P\u2009=\u20090.014) and premature birth (OR\u2009=\u20092.76, 95% CI:1.34-5.46, P\u2009=\u20090.005).\nMore than 3\u00a0h general anesthesia influenced the IQ of school age children for up to 3\u00a0months after orthopedic surgery. Beside extended exposure time to anesthetics additional factors for post-operative IQ reduction were younger children age, mothers with low educational levels and premature birth.\nChinese Clinical Trial Registry with registration number ChiCTR-OOC-17013497 \u00a0retrospectively registered on 11/23/2017.", "Demonstrated is the code division multiple access (CDMA)-mode coded access optical sensor (CAOS) smart camera suited for bright target scenarios. Deploying a silicon CMOS sensor and a silicon point detector within a digital micro-mirror device (DMD)-based spatially isolating hybrid camera design, this smart imager first engages the DMD starring mode with a controlled factor of 200 high optical attenuation of the scene irradiance to provide a classic unsaturated CMOS sensor-based image for target intelligence gathering. Next, this CMOS sensor provided image data is used to acquire a focused zone more robust un-attenuated true target image using the time-modulated CDMA-mode of the CAOS camera. Using four different bright light test target scenes, successfully demonstrated is a proof-of-concept visible band CAOS smart camera operating in the CDMA-mode using up-to 4096 bits length Walsh design CAOS pixel codes with a maximum 10 KHz code bit rate giving a 0.4096 seconds CAOS frame acquisition time.

The CDMA-mode of the CAOS smart camera is suited for applications where robust high dynamic range (DR) imaging is needed for un-attenuated un-spoiled bright light spectrally diverse targets.", "This 'What's new in oncodermatology?' addresses the developments in 2017 on the epidemiology and management of skin cancers. We observe a constant increase in carcinomas, risk factors for squamous cell carcinoma, especially in transplant recipients where skin cancer mortality is important. Among epidemiological developments in melanoma are increased mortality despite screening, occupational exposure to UV, second melanoma and higher risk after carcinoma. New classifications that should be considered are AJCC8 for melanoma and carcinoma. In a near future artificial intelligence could change skin cancer screening practices through deep learning. For the sentinel lymph node, there is no interest in systematic lymphadenectomy that does not improve survival. Radiation therapy is essential for the prognosis of Merkel's carcinoma, and Mohs' surgery can be of interest. In metastatic melanoma, results on immunotherapy and targeted treatments include duration, dose, combinations, and the study of resistance mechanisms. The great novelty is immunotherapy or targeted therapy as an adjuvant treatment, giving an improvement in survival without relapse.", "This manuscript provides a selection of dermatological research manuscripts published from September 2016 to August 2017. It is not an exhaustive review but rather a selection of manuscripts susceptible to modify the dermatological practice or affording new pathophysiologic mechanisms and new therapeutic approaches. The following areas of interest are concerned: recognition of dermatological images by artificial intelligence, new concepts in atopic dermatitis, wound repair and hair growth cycle. New data concerning melanomagenesis, epidermolysis bullosa simplex and drug eruption are also highlighted.", "Traditionally, clinical decision making has been perceived as a purely rational and cognitive process. Recently, a number of authors have linked emotional intelligence (EI) to clinical decision making (CDM) and calls have been made for an increased focus on EI skills for clinicians. The objective of this integrative literature review was to identify and synthesise the empirical evidence for a role of emotion in CDM.\nA systematic search of the bibliographic databases PubMed, PsychINFO, and CINAHL (EBSCO) was conducted to identify empirical studies of clinician populations. Search terms were focused to identify studies reporting clinician emotion OR clinician emotional intelligence OR emotional competence AND clinical decision making OR clinical reasoning.\nTwenty three papers were retained for synthesis. These represented empirical work from qualitative, quantitative, and mixed-methods approaches and comprised work with a focus on experienced emotion and on skills associated with emotional intelligence. The studies examined nurses (10), physicians (7), occupational therapists (1), physiotherapists (1), mixed clinician samples (3), and unspecified infectious disease experts (1). We identified two main themes in the context of clinical decision making: the subjective experience of emotion; and, the application of emotion and cognition in CDM. Sub-themes under the subjective experience of emotion were: emotional response to contextual pressures; emotional responses to others; and, intentional exclusion of emotion from CDM. Under the application of emotion and cognition in CDM, sub-themes were: compassionate emotional labour - responsiveness to patient emotion within CDM; interdisciplinary tension regarding the significance and meaning of emotion in CDM; and, emotion and moral judgement.\nClinicians' experienced emotions can and do affect clinical decision making, although acknowledgement of that is far from universal. Importantly, this occurs in the in the absence of a clear theoretical framework and educational preparation may not reflect the importance of emotional competence to effective CDM.", "The application of artificial intelligence in the diagnosis of obstructive lung diseases is an exciting phenomenon. Artificial intelligence algorithms work by finding patterns in data obtained from diagnostic tests, which can be used to predict clinical outcomes or to detect obstructive phenotypes. The purpose of this review is to describe the latest trends and to discuss the future potential of artificial intelligence in the diagnosis of obstructive lung diseases.\nMachine learning has been successfully used in automated interpretation of pulmonary function tests for differential diagnosis of obstructive lung diseases. Deep learning models such as convolutional neural network are state-of-the art for obstructive pattern recognition in computed tomography. Machine learning has also been applied in other diagnostic approaches such as forced oscillation test, breath analysis, lung sound analysis and telemedicine with promising results in small-scale studies.\nOverall, the application of artificial intelligence has produced encouraging results in the diagnosis of obstructive lung diseases. However, large-scale studies are still required to validate current findings and to boost its adoption by the medical community.", "Smart reconfiguration of a dynamic networking environment is offered by the central control of Software-Defined Networking (SDN). Centralized SDN-based management architectures are capable of retrieving global topology intelligence and decoupling the forwarding plane from the control plane. Routing protocols developed for conventional Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) utilize limited iterative reconfiguration methods to optimize environmental reporting. However, the challenging networking scenarios of WSNs involve a performance overhead due to constant periodic iterative reconfigurations. In this paper, we propose the SDN-based Application-aware Centralized adaptive Flow Iterative Reconfiguring (SACFIR) routing protocol with the centralized SDN iterative solver controller to maintain the load-balancing between flow reconfigurations and flow allocation cost. The proposed SACFIR's routing protocol offers a unique iterative path-selection algorithm, which initially computes suitable clustering based on residual resources at the control layer and then implements application-aware threshold-based multi-hop report transmissions on the forwarding plane. The operation of the SACFIR algorithm is centrally supervised by the SDN controller residing at the Base Station (BS). This paper extends SACFIR to SDN-based Application-aware Main-value Centralized adaptive Flow Iterative Reconfiguring (SAMCFIR) to establish both proactive and reactive reporting. The SAMCFIR transmission phase enables sensor nodes to trigger direct transmissions for main-value reports, while in the case of SACFIR, all reports follow computed routes. Our SDN-enabled proposed models adjust the reconfiguration period according to the traffic burden on sensor nodes, which results in heterogeneity awareness, load-balancing and application-specific reconfigurations of WSNs. Extensive experimental simulation-based results show that SACFIR and SAMCFIR yield the maximum scalability, network lifetime and stability period when compared to existing routing protocols.", "to analyze differences in the variables for the object of this study (attitude toward communication, emotional intelligence, and empathy) according to sex; verify correlations among variables between men and women and analyze regression models according to sex.\nthe ATC was used to measure attitudes toward communication; the Jefferson Scale of Empathy was used to measure empathy; and the Trait Meta Mood Scale 24 was used to measure emotional intelligence. The sample was composed of 450 nurses working in 7 hospitals located in Valencia, Spain. The t-test for independent samples was used to verify whether there were statistically significant differences, together with a prior application of the Levene test to assess the equality of variances. The correlations were analyzed using Person's coefficient. Finally, the Beta coefficients of variables predicting ATC's dimensions were verified using hierarchical multiple linear regression according to sex.\nThere are statistically significant differences based on sex for the variables, correlations and power of prediction.\nThis study presents evidence on how the levels of variables (attitudes toward communication, EI, and empathy) vary among nurses according to sex, as well as the relationships established among such variables.", "Small-molecule drug discovery can be viewed as a challenging multidimensional problem in which various characteristics of compounds - including efficacy, pharmacokinetics and safety - need to be optimized in parallel to provide drug candidates. Recent advances in areas such as microfluidics-assisted chemical synthesis and biological testing, as well as artificial intelligence systems that improve a design hypothesis through feedback analysis, are now providing a basis for the introduction of greater automation into aspects of this process. This could potentially accelerate time frames for compound discovery and optimization and enable more effective searches of chemical space. However, such approaches also raise considerable conceptual, technical and organizational challenges, as well as scepticism about the current hype around them. This article aims to identify the approaches and technologies that could be implemented robustly by medicinal chemists in the near future and to critically analyse the opportunities and challenges for their more widespread application.", "To characterize patients with syndromic craniosynostosis with respect to their neuropsycholinguistic abilities and to present these findings together with the brain abnormalities.\nEighteen patients with a diagnosis of syndromic craniosynostosis were studied. Eight patients had Apert syndrome and 10 had Crouzon syndrome. They were submitted to phonological evaluation, neuropsychological evaluation and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain. The phonological evaluation was done by behavioral observation of the language, the Peabody test, Token test and a school achievement test. The neuropsychological evaluation included the WISC III and WAIS tests.\nAbnormalities in language abilities were observed and the school achievement test showed abnormalities in 66.67% of the patients. A normal intelligence quotient was observed in 39.3% of the patients, and congenital abnormalities of the central nervous system were observed in 46.4% of the patients.\nAbnormalities of language abilities were observed in the majority of patients with syndromic craniosynostosis, and low cognitive performance was also observed.", "Metabolic equivalents, or METs, are routinely employed as a guide to exercise training and activity prescription and to categorize cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF). There are, however, inherent limitations to the concept, as well as common misapplications. CRF and the patient's capacity for physical activity are often overestimated and underestimated, respectively. Moreover, frequently cited fitness thresholds associated with the highest and lowest mortality rates may be misleading, as these are influenced by several factors, including age and gender. The conventional assumption that 1 MET\u2009=\u20093.5\u2009mL O2/kg/min has been challenged in numerous studies that indicate a significant overestimation of actual resting energy expenditure in some populations, including coronary patients, the morbidly obese, and individuals taking \u03b2-blockers. These data have implications for classifying relative energy expenditure at submaximal and peak exercise. Heart rate may be used to approximate activity METs, resulting in a promising new fitness metric termed the \"personal activity intelligence\" or PAI score. Despite some limitations, the MET concept provides a useful method to quantitate CRF and define a repertoire of physical activities that are likely to be safe and therapeutic. In conclusion, for previously inactive adults, moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, which corresponds to \u22653 METs, may increase MET capacity and decrease the risk of future cardiac events.", "Literature,achievements and other materials on acupuncture-moxibustion standardization research in recent years were collected and summarized domestically and overseas. The process of acupuncture-moxibustion standardization in China was reviewed through two phases. Also,we compared domestic acupuncture-moxibustion standardization study with the foreign one. It is considered that its domestic development is sound but challenged by world competition in its internationalization. Going forward,acupuncture-moxibustion standardization system is needed to be completed and become international. Contemporary techniques should be used including big data,artificial intelligence,internet of things,and cloud computing,etc., and its application engineering research will be improved so as to drive Chinese medicine modernization.", "The purpose of this article is to describe and assess the effectiveness of an innovative teaching approach in an advanced pharmacy practice experience (APPE) and leadership elective.\nThree cohorts of students [(2014: n = 14), (2015: n = 17), (2016: n = 19)] were introduced to the photovoice (PV) method in their leadership APPE. PV required students to take, present, and discuss photographs within their cohorts. PV was used as a teaching method with the intention that the process would compel students to be involved in leadership development throughout experiential rotations, participate in discussions related to leadership development, and engage in creative activity. Group discussions from the class of 2014 were recorded and transcribed. Students from all cohorts were asked to participate in an electronic survey containing items based on PV learning objectives. All students were asked to participate in semi-structured interviews about PV.\nThe inductive coding method was used to identify themes from discussion transcripts. Analysis of themes revealed 51.5% of the PV photographs related to emotional intelligence. Development of others and strong teams were themes represented in 44.3% of photographs. Survey data indicated all respondents agreed PV was a valuable method to describe learning in leadership. Interview coding revealed themes related to emotional intelligence and development of teams.\nThe PV method was an effective teaching tool in a leadership APPE and elective course. PV is a teaching method to be utilized in a variety of experiential learning environments to better enhance the professional development of pharmacy students.", "To date, there are many people residing in areas with high levels of iodide in water. Our previous epidemiological study showed that exposure to high iodine in drinking water significantly reduced the intelligence of children although the mechanisms remain unclear. To explore whether high concentrations of iodide may cause cytotoxic effect and the role of autophagy in the high iodide-induced apoptosis, human neuroblastoma cells (SH-SY5Y cells) were exposed to high concentrations of iodide. Morphological phenotypes, cell viability, Hoechst 33258 staining, the expression levels of apoptosis and autophagy-related proteins were detected. A possible effect of an inhibitor (3-methyladenine, 3-MA) or an inducer (rapamycin) of autophagy on high iodide-induced apoptosis also was examined. Results indicated that high iodide changed cellular morphology, decreased cell viability and increased the protein's expression level of apoptosis and autophagy. In addition, high iodide-induced apoptosis was enhanced by inhibition of autophagy and inhibited by activation of autophagy in SH-SY5Y cells. Collectively, high concentrations of iodide are toxic to SH-SY5Y cells, as well as induce apoptosis and autophagy. Furthermore, autophagy plays a regulatory role in high concentrations of iodide-induced apoptosis in SH-SY5Y cells.", "Artificial muscle-like biomaterials have gained tremendous interests owing to their broad applications in regenerative medicine, wearable devices, bioelectronics and artificial intelligence. Unfortunately, key challenges are still existed for current materials, including biomimetic viscoelasticity, biocompatibility and biodegradation, multifunctionality. Herein, for the first time, we develop highly elastomeric, conductive and biodegradable poly (citric acid-octanediol-polyethylene glycol)(PCE)-graphene (PCEG) nanocomposites, and demonstrate their applications in myogenic differentiation and guiding skeletal muscle tissue regeneration. In PCEG nanocomposites, PCE provides the biomimetic elastomeric behavior, and the addition of reduced graphene oxide (RGO) endows the enhanced mechanical strength and conductivity. The highly elastomeric behavior, significantly enhanced modulus (400%-800%), strength (200%-300%) of PCEG nanocomposites with controlled biodegradability and electrochemical conductivity were achieved. The myoblasts proliferation and myogenic differentiation were significantly improved by PCEG nanocomposite. Significantly high in\u00a0vivo biocompatibility of PCEG nanocomposites was observed when implanted in the subcutaneous tissue for 4 weeks in rats. PCEG nanocomposites could significantly enhance the muscle fibers and blood vessels formation in\u00a0vivo in a skeletal muscle lesion model of rat. This study may provide a novel strategy to develop multifunctional elastomeric nanocomposites with high biocompatibility for potential soft tissue regeneration and stretchable bioelectronic devices.", "The question of whether working memory training leads to generalized improvements in untrained cognitive abilities is a longstanding and heatedly debated one. Previous research provides mostly ambiguous evidence regarding the presence or absence of transfer effects in older adults. Thus, to draw decisive conclusions regarding the effectiveness of working memory training interventions, methodologically sound studies with larger sample sizes are needed. In this study, we investigated whether or not a computer-based working memory training intervention induced near and far transfer in a large sample of 142 healthy older adults (65 to 80 years). Therefore, we randomly assigned participants to either the experimental group, which completed 25 sessions of adaptive, process-based working memory training, or to the active, adaptive visual search control group. Bayesian linear mixed-effects models were used to estimate performance improvements on the level of abilities, using multiple indicator tasks for near (working memory) and far transfer (fluid intelligence, shifting, and inhibition). Our data provided consistent evidence supporting the absence of near transfer to untrained working memory tasks and the absence of far transfer effects to all of the assessed abilities. Our results suggest that working memory training is not an effective way to improve general cognitive functioning in old age. (PsycINFO Database Record", "Congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT) represent the primary cause of chronic kidney disease in children. Many genes have been attributed to the genesis of this disorder. Recently, haploinsufficiency of PBX1 caused by microdeletions has been shown to result in bilateral renal hypoplasia and other organ malformations.\nHere, we report on a 14-year-old male patient with congenital bilateral dysplastic kidneys, cryptorchidism, hypoplastic clavicles, developmental delay, impaired intelligence, and minor dysmorphic features. Presuming a syndromic origin, we performed SNP array analysis to scan for large copy number variations (CNVs) followed by whole-exome sequencing (WES). Sanger sequencing was done to confirm the variant's de novo status.\nSNP array analysis did not reveal any microdeletions or -duplications larger than 50 or 100\u2009kb, respectively. WES identified a novel heterozygous 7-bp frameshift deletion in PBX1 (c.413_419del, p.Gly138Valfs*40) resulting in a loss-of-function. The de novo status could be confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\nBy WES, we identified a novel heterozygous de novo 7-bp frameshift deletion in PBX1. Our findings expand the spectrum of causative variants in PBX1-related CAKUT. In this case, WES proved to be the apt technique to detect the variant responsible for the patient's phenotype, as single gene testing is not feasible given the multitude of genes involved in CAKUT and SNP array analysis misses rare single-nucleotide variants and small Indels.", "Molecular variants of vitamin B12, siderophores, and glycans occur. To take up variant forms, bacteria may express an array of receptors. The gut microbe Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron has three different receptors to take up variants of vitamin B12 and 88 receptors to take up various glycans. The design of receptor arrays reflects key processes that shape cellular evolution. Competition may focus each species on a subset of the available nutrient diversity. Some gut bacteria can take up only a narrow range of carbohydrates, whereas species such as B.\u00a0thetaiotaomicron can digest many different complex glycans. Comparison of different nutrients, habitats, and genomes provides opportunity to test hypotheses about the breadth of receptor arrays. Another important process concerns fluctuations in nutrient availability. Such fluctuations enhance the value of cellular sensors, which gain information about environmental availability and adjust receptor deployment. Bacteria often adjust receptor expression in response to fluctuations of particular carbohydrate food sources. Some species may adjust expression of uptake receptors for specific siderophores. How do cells use sensor information to control the response to fluctuations? This question about regulatory wiring relates to problems that arise in control theory and artificial intelligence. Control theory clarifies how to analyze environmental fluctuations in relation to the design of sensors and response systems. Recent advances in deep learning studies of artificial intelligence focus on the architecture of regulatory wiring and the ways in which complex control networks represent and classify environmental states. I emphasize the similar design problems that arise in cellular evolution, control theory, and artificial intelligence. I connect those broad conceptual aspects to many testable hypotheses for bacterial uptake of vitamin B12, siderophores, and glycans.", "The investment theory of adult intelligence posits that individual differences in knowledge attainment result from people's differences in cognitive ability and their propensity to apply and invest that ability, which is referred to as investment personality traits. Here, we differentiated intellectual (i.e., intellectual curiosity) and nonintellectual investment (i.e., openness to experience), and we tested their respective predictive validity for knowledge attainment in four independent lab-based studies (overall N = 649). Openness to experience was positively associated with knowledge attainment across all four studies, and this effect was by and large independent of cognitive ability. By contrast, intellectual curiosity was not related to knowledge attainment. The findings suggest that openness to experience, rather than intellectual curiosity, is the investment personality trait that broadly benefits learning and adult intelligence.", "To encourage the academy to pursue innovative management education strategies within pharmacy curricula and highlight these experiences in a scholarly dialogue.\nManagement has often been a dreaded, dry, and often neglected aspect of pharmacy curricula. With the release of Center for Advancement of Pharmacy Education (CAPE) Educational Outcomes 2013 as well as Entry-Level Competencies Needed for Community Pharmacy Practice by National Association of Chain Drug Stores (NACDS) Foundation, National Community Pharmacists Association (NCPA), and Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education (ACPE) in 2012, managerial skills have seen a new emphasis in pharmacy education. Further, management has greater emphasis within ACPE \"Standards 2016\" through adoption of CAPE Educational Outcomes 2013 into the standards. Previous literature has shown success of innovative learning strategies in management education such as active learning, use of popular television shows, and emotional intelligence. The academy must build a more extensive scholarly body of work highlighting successful educational strategies to engage pharmacy students in an often-dreaded subject through applying the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning.", "Working memory contributes to many higher-order cognitive processes and predicts general cognitive skills. It is therefore important to know if its functions are trainable. In this study we investigated the malleability of working memory processes in schoolchildren whose cognitive functions are still developing. We also analyzed transfer effects to both general and specific intellectual skills. To address these issues, we examined the effectiveness of working memory training (10 training sessions) in terms of practice effects (trained tasks), near-transfer effects (working memory capacity), and far-transfer effects (psychometric intelligence). Sixty-nine children aged 8-10 participated in the study. The experimental group (42 children) participated in working memory training that intensely engaged the updating function of working memory. The training tasks, implemented as computer games, were based on the n-back and keep track paradigms. There was also an active control group (27 children). The results suggest that the experimental group improved their working memory capacity, as measured with both trained and untrained tasks. Regarding intelligence, far-transfer effects were weak and may be attributed to mere repetition of measurements. Moreover, whereas improvement in the training tasks could be observed after 15 months, the far-transfer effects disappeared in the delayed assessment.", "Speech intelligibility, or how well a speaker's words are understood by others, affects listeners' judgments of the speaker's competence and personality. Deaf cochlear implant (CI) users vary widely in speech intelligibility, and their speech may have a noticeable \"deaf\" quality, both of which could evoke negative stereotypes or judgments from peers. In this study, college students with typical hearing (TH) used semantic differential scales to rate speech samples of highly-intelligible TH young adults and age-matched CI users with high or low intelligibility (CI-Hi, CI-Lo) on personality traits related to competence (intelligence, achievement), friendship skills (friendliness, popularity), and attractiveness as a friend (extraversion, dependability). Judges rated TH positively, CI-Lo negatively, and CI-Hi as intermediate, even though CI-Hi were as intelligible as TH. Both CI user groups were rated as friendly but unattractive as friends (insecure, shy, boring, unpopular, does not \"sound like someone who could be my friend\"), underlining the role of deaf speech quality in peer judgments. Such negative first impressions are likely to affect CI users' social interactions and friendships, highlighting the importance of speech intelligibility and quality for CI users and calling for education on deafness and deaf speech for TH peers.", "Abnormal maternal thyroid function in pregnancy may impair fetal brain development, but more evidence is needed to refine and corroborate the hypothesis.\nTo estimate the association between maternal thyroid function in early pregnancy and neuropsychological performance of the child at 5 years of age.\nFollow-up study.\nA cohort of 1153 women and their children sampled from the Danish National Birth Cohort. Maternal thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and free thyroxine (fT4) were measured in stored biobank sera from early pregnancy.\nChild neuropsychological test results (Wechsler Intelligence Scale/Test of Everyday Attention), test of motor function (Movement Assessment Battery), and results of parent and teacher reports (Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function/Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire).\nAltogether 145 children (12.6%) were born to mothers with abnormal thyroid function in the early pregnancy. High maternal TSH and low fT4 were associated with lower child verbal intelligence quotient (adjusted mean difference TSH \u2265 10 mIU/L vs 0.1 to 2.49 mIU/L, -8.9 [95% confidence interval (CI), -15 to -2.4]; fT4 < 10 pmol/l vs 12.0 to 18.99 pmol/l, -13 [95% CI, -19 to -7.3]). Abnormal maternal thyroid function was also associated with adverse motor function and teacher-reported problems of executive function and behavior, and these associations were dominated by exposure to maternal hypothyroxinemia.\nMaternal thyroid hormone abnormalities were associated with adverse neuropsychological function of the child at 5 years of age. For intelligence, marked hypothyroidism was important, whereas for motor function and executive and behavior problems, maternal hypothyroxinemia was predominant.", "Psychopathy is a personality construct that has been related to important emotional deficits. These findings have led to a growing interest in exploring if psychopathic traits are associated with emotional intelligence (EI). However, the literature exploring this association has revealed conflicting results. The aim of the present study was to provide a reliable estimate of the relationship between psychopathy traits and EI (measured as performance-based ability) through meta-analysis. A quantitative and systematic review of the literature using Scopus, Medline, Pubmed, and PsicINFO showed a total of 13 studies meeting inclusion criteria with a combined sample of 2401 participants. The meta-analysis revealed a significant negative relationship between both constructs, showing that higher psychopathic trait scores are related to lower EI levels. We propose several future research lines to clarify possible gaps and ambiguities in the current literature and a set of interesting clinical implications for the prevention, evaluation, and treatment of psychopathic traits by including EI factors in traditional models of psychopathy.", "A central challenge of developing and evaluating artificial intelligence and machine learning methods for regression and classification is access to data that illuminates the strengths and weaknesses of different methods. Open data plays an important role in this process by making it easy for computational researchers to easily access real data for this purpose. Genomics has in some examples taken a leading role in the open data effort starting with DNA microarrays. While real data from experimental and observational studies is necessary for developing computational methods it is not sufficient. This is because it is not possible to know what the ground truth is in real data. This must be accompanied by simulated data where that balance between signal and noise is known and can be directly evaluated. Unfortunately, there is a lack of methods and software for simulating data with the kind of complexity found in real biological and biomedical systems. We present here the Heuristic Identification of Biological Architectures for simulating Complex Hierarchical Interactions (HIBACHI) method and prototype software for simulating complex biological and biomedical data. Further, we introduce new methods for developing simulation models that generate data that specifically allows discrimination between different machine learning methods.", "Cancer is a complex genetic disease that develops from the accumulation of genomic alterations in which germline variations predispose individuals to cancer and somatic alterations initiate and trigger the progression of cancer. For the past 2 decades, genomic research has advanced remarkably, evolving from single-gene to whole-genome screening by using genome-wide association study and next-generation sequencing that contributes to big genomic data. International collaborative efforts have contributed to curating these data to identify clinically significant alterations that could be used in clinical settings. Focusing on breast cancer, the present review summarizes the identification of genomic alterations with high-throughput screening as well as the use of genomic information in clinical trials that match cancer patients to therapies, which further leads to cancer precision medicine. Furthermore, cancer screening and monitoring were enhanced greatly by the use of liquid biopsies. With the growing data complexity and size, there is much anticipation in exploiting deep machine learning and artificial intelligence to curate integrative \"-omics\" data to refine the current medical practice to be applied in the near future.", "Prior work largely confirms the presence of various emotional processing deficits among individuals with an alcohol use disorder (AUD); however, their specificity and relevance still warrant investigation. The aim of the current study was to compare selected aspects of emotional processing (i.e., mental state recognition, alexithymia, and emotional intelligence) between individuals treated for an AUD and healthy individuals.\nThe AUD sample consisted of 92 abstinent men with AUD who were participating in an 8-week inpatient abstinence-based treatment program in Warsaw, Poland. The healthy control (HC) group consisted of 86 men recruited from the Medical University of Warsaw and the Nowowiejski Hospital administrative staff. Baseline information about demographics, psychopathological symptoms, and severity of alcohol problems was obtained. Mental states recognition was assessed using the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET). Alexithymia was measured with the Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20). The Schutte Self-Report Emotional Intelligence Test (SSEIT) was used to measure emotional intelligence (EI).\nAfter accounting for potentially confounding variables (demographics, severity of depression, anxiety symptoms) in MANCOVA models, patients with AUD presented deficits in identification and description of their own emotional states, as well as lower emotion regulation skills when compared to HCs. No between-group differences were observed in self-reported recognition of other people's emotions, social skills, and a behavioral measure of mental states recognition. Specific rather than general emotion-processing deficits in participants with AUD were identified, suggesting problems with processing of intrapersonal emotional signals.", "Pediatric cervical spine injury (CSI) after blunt trauma is rare. Nonetheless, missing these injuries can have severe consequences. To prevent the overuse of radiographic imaging, two clinical decision tools have been developed: The National Emergency X-Radiography Utilization Study (NEXUS) criteria and the Canadian C-spine Rule (CCR). Both tools are proven to be accurate in deciding whether or not diagnostic imaging is needed in adults presenting for blunt trauma screening at the emergency department. However, little information is known about the accuracy of these triage tools in a pediatric population.\nTo determine the diagnostic accuracy of the NEXUS criteria and the Canadian C-spine Rule in a pediatric population evaluated for CSI following blunt trauma.\nWe searched the following databases to 24 February 2015: CENTRAL, MEDLINE, MEDLINE Non-Indexed and In-Process Citations, PubMed, Embase, Science Citation Index, ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Database, OpenGrey, ClinicalTrials.gov, World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, the Health Technology Assessment, and the Aggressive Research Intelligence Facility.\nWe included all retrospective and prospective studies involving children following blunt trauma that evaluated the accuracy of the NEXUS criteria, the Canadian C-spine Rule, or both. Plain radiography, computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the cervical spine, and follow-up were considered as adequate reference standards.\nTwo review authors independently assessed the quality of included studies using the QUADAS-2 checklists. They extracted data on study design, patient characteristics, inclusion and exclusion criteria, clinical parameters, target condition, reference standard, and the diagnostic two-by-two table. We calculated and plotted sensitivity, specificity and negative predictive value in ROC space, and constructed forest plots for visual examination of variation in test accuracy.\nThree cohort studies were eligible for analysis, including 3380 patients ; 96 children were diagnosed with CSI. One study evaluated the accuracy of the Canadian C-spine Rule and the NEXUS criteria, and two studies evaluated the accuracy of the NEXUS criteria. The studies were of moderate quality. Due to the small number of included studies and the diverse outcomes of those studies, we could not describe a pooled estimate for the diagnostic test accuracy. The sensitivity of the NEXUS criteria of the individual studies was 0.57 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.18 to 0.90), 0.98 (95% CI 0.91 to 1.00) and 1.00 (95% CI 0.88 to 1.00). The specificity of the NEXUS criteria was 0.35 (95% CI 0.25 to 0.45), 0.54 (95% CI 0.45 to 0.62) and 0.2 (95% CI 0.18 to 0.21). For the Canadian C-spine Rule the sensitivity was 0.86 (95% CI 0.42 to 1.00) and specificity was 0.15 (95% CI 0.08 to 0.23). Since the quantity of the data was small we were not able to investigate heterogeneity.\nThere are currently few studies assessing the diagnostic test accuracy of the NEXUS criteria and CCR in children. At the moment, there is not enough evidence to determine the accuracy of the Canadian C-spine Rule to detect CSI in pediatric trauma patients following blunt trauma. The confidence interval of the sensitivity of the NEXUS criteria between the individual studies showed a wide range, with a lower limit varying from 0.18 to 0.91 with a total of four false negative test results, meaning that if physicians use the NEXUS criteria in children, there is a chance of missing CSI. Since missing CSI could have severe consequences with the risk of significant morbidity, we consider that the NEXUS criteria are at best a guide to clinical assessment, with current evidence not supporting strict or protocolized adoption of the tool into pediatric trauma care. Moreover, we have to keep in mind that the sensitivity differs among several studies, and individual confidence intervals of these studies show a wide range. Our main conclusion is therefore that additional well-designed studies with large sample sizes are required to better evaluate the accuracy of the NEXUS criteria or the Canadian C-spine Rule, or both, in order to determine whether they are appropriate triage tools for the clearance of the cervical spine in children following blunt trauma.", "Cognitive impairment is frequent in cerebral palsy (CP) and there is a lack of multiprofessional screening instruments.\nThe aim of this study was to investigate the utility of the Mini-Mental State Examination for Children (MMC), an adapted version of the Mini-Mental State Examination, in screening for cognitive impairments in children with CP.\nWe assessed 397 Brazilian children, 310 with typical development and 87 with CP (hemiplegic and quadriplegic forms), aged 5-16 years. Association between the MMC and general intelligence was assessed by the Colored Progressive Matrices instrument.\nPsychometric indexes for the MMC were adequate. ROC analyses revealed effective diagnostic accuracy in all ages assessed. Cut-off values are reported. Major difficulties on the MMC were observed in children with CP, particularly individuals with the quadriplegic form. Moreover, the MMC showed moderate correlation with the intelligence test, and was reliable in discriminating, among clinical cases, those with poorer cognitive abilities.\nThe MMC could be useful as a multiprofessional screening instrument for cognitive impairment in children with hemiplegic CP. Results of the MMC in quadriplegic CP children should be interpreted with caution. Diagnosis should be confirmed by further psychological testing.\nComprometimentos cognitivos s\u00e3o frequentes na Paralisia Cerebral (PC) e existe uma falta de instrumentos multiprofissionais para uma triagem.\nInvestigar a viabilidade do uso do mini-exame do estado mental para crian\u00e7as (MMC), uma adapta\u00e7\u00e3o do mini-exame do estado mental, como uma triagem para comprometimento cognitivo em crian\u00e7as com PC.\nN\u00f3s avaliamos 397 crian\u00e7as brasileiras, 310 com desenvolvimento t\u00edpico e 87 com PC (hemipl\u00e9gica e quadripl\u00e9gica), com idades entre cinco e 16 anos.

The ANN-2Day model was developed using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) Toolbox in MATLAB Program and 15-years of epidemiological and environmental data for six independent environmental predictors including water temperature, solar radiation, gage height, salinity, wind, and rainfall. It was found that oyster norovirus outbreaks can be forecasted with two-day lead time using the ANN-2Day model and daily data of the six environmental predictors. Forecasting results of the ANN-2Day model indicated that the model was capable of reproducing 19years of historical oyster norovirus outbreaks along the Northern Gulf of Mexico coast with the positive predictive value of 76.82%, the negative predictive value of 100.00%, the sensitivity of 100.00%, the specificity of 99.84%, and the overall accuracy of 99.83%, respectively, demonstrating the efficacy of the ANN-2Day model in predicting the risk of norovirus outbreaks to human health. The 2-day lead time enables public health agencies and oyster harvesters to plan for management interventions and thus makes it possible to achieve a paradigm shift of their daily management and operation from primarily reacting to epidemic incidents of norovirus infection after they have occurred to eliminating (or at least reducing) the risk of costly incidents.", "The study aims to determine whether brief, group-administered screening measures can reliably identify second-grade children at risk for language impairment (LI) or dyslexia and to examine the degree to which parents of affected children were aware of their children's difficulties.\nParticipants (N = 381) completed screening tasks and assessments of word reading, oral language, and nonverbal intelligence. Their parents completed questionnaires that inquired about reading and language development.\nDespite considerable overlap in the children meeting criteria for LI and dyslexia, many children exhibited problems in only one domain. The combined screening tasks reliably identified children at risk for either LI or dyslexia (area under the curve = 0.842), but they were more accurate at identifying risk for dyslexia than LI. Parents of children with LI and/or dyslexia were frequently unaware of their children's difficulties. Parents of children with LI but good word reading skills were the least likely of all impairment groups to report concerns or prior receipt of speech, language, or reading services.\nGroup-administered screens can identify children at risk of LI and/or dyslexia with good classification accuracy and in less time than individually administered measures. More research is needed to improve the identification of children with LI who display good word reading skills.", "What can artificial intelligence learn from neuroscience, and vice versa?", "Epilepsy is the most common chronic neurological disease and has neurological impairment as an important comorbidity.\nTo find behavioral problems and intelligence quotient (IQ) changes associated with epilepsy and to know the association of variables such as frequency, type of seizures, and duration of disease with cognitive impairment.\nA descriptive cross sectional study, consisting of 50 cases (patients of epilepsy) and 50 controls (other patients of same socioeconomic status) was conducted at S.P. Medical College, Bikaner. The patients were subjected to detailed clinical history, thorough examination, Pediatric Symptom Checklist, and Bhatia's Battery of Performance intelligence Test. Data analysis was carried out with the help of SPSS 22 software.\nThe prevalence of behavioral problems in generalized and partial seizure group was high (42% and 53.8%) as compared to control group (9%). Low IQ was present more in the patients (44%) of generalized and partial seizure group as compared with the control group, and results were statistically significant. Furthermore, behavioral problems were more in patients who were having more number of seizures (\u22653 per year) with significant P values (\u03c72 = 5.067, P = 0.024).\nWe conclusively found that behavioral problems and cognitive factors, apart from control of seizures, must be kept in mind to determine how well a child with epilepsy progresses toward independence.", "Working memory (WM) is a central construct in cognitive neuroscience because it comprises mechanisms of active information maintenance and cognitive control that underpin most complex cognitive behavior. Individual variation in WM has been associated with multiple behavioral and health features including demographic characteristics, cognitive and physical traits and lifestyle choices. In this context, we used sparse canonical correlation analyses (sCCAs) to determine the covariation between brain imaging metrics of WM-network activation and connectivity and nonimaging measures relating to sensorimotor processing, affective and nonaffective cognition, mental health and personality, physical health and lifestyle choices derived from 823 healthy participants derived from the Human Connectome Project. We conducted sCCAs at two levels: a global level, testing the overall association between the entire imaging and behavioral-health data sets; and a modular level, testing associations between subsets of the two data sets. The behavioral-health and neuroimaging data sets showed significant interdependency. Variables with positive correlation to the neuroimaging variate represented higher physical endurance and fluid intelligence as well as better function in multiple higher-order cognitive domains. Negatively correlated variables represented indicators of suboptimal cardiovascular and metabolic control and lifestyle choices such as alcohol and nicotine use. These results underscore the importance of accounting for behavioral-health factors in neuroimaging studies of WM and provide a neuroscience-informed framework for personalized and public health interventions to promote and maintain the integrity of the WM network.", "It remains challenging to fabricate strain-sensing materials and exquisite geometric constructions for integrating extraordinary sensitivity, low strain detectability, high stretchability, tunable sensing range, and thin device dimensions into a single type of strain sensor. A percolation network based on Ti3C2Tx MXene/carbon nanotube (CNT) composites was rationally designed and fabricated into versatile strain sensors. This weaving architecture with excellent electric properties combined the sensitive two-dimensional (2D) Ti3C2Tx MXene nanostacks with conductive and stretchable one-dimensional (1D) CNT crossing. The resulting strain sensor can be used to detect both tiny and large deformations with an ultralow detection limit of 0.1% strain, high stretchability (up to 130%), high sensitivity (gauge factor up to 772.6), tunable sensing range (30% to 130% strain), thin device dimensions (<2 \u03bcm), and excellent reliability and stability (>5000 cycles). The versatile and scalable Ti3C2Tx MXene/CNT strain sensors provide a promising route to future wearable artificial intelligence with comprehensive tracking ability of real-time and in situ physiological signals for health and sporting applications.", "Neuropsychological assessment requires accurate estimation of an individual's premorbid cognitive abilities. Oral word reading tests, such as the test of premorbid functioning (TOPF), and demographic variables, such as age, sex, and level of education, provide a reasonable indication of premorbid intelligence, but their ability to predict other related cognitive abilities is less well understood. This study aimed to develop regression equations, based on the TOPF and demographic variables, to predict scores on tests of verbal fluency and naming ability.\nA sample of 119 healthy adults provided demographic information and were tested using the TOPF, FAS, animal naming test (ANT), and graded naming test (GNT). Multiple regression analyses, using the TOPF and demographics as predictor variables, were used to estimate verbal fluency and naming ability test scores. Change scores and cases of significant impairment were calculated for two clinical samples with diagnosed neurological conditions (TBI and meningioma) using the method in Knight, McMahon, Green, and Skeaff ().\nDemographic variables provided a significant contribution to the prediction of all verbal fluency and naming ability test scores; however, adding TOPF score to the equation\u00a0considerably improved prediction beyond that afforded by demographic variables alone. The percentage of variance accounted for by demographic variables and/or TOPF score varied from 19 per cent (FAS), 28 per cent (ANT), and 41 per cent (GNT). Change scores revealed significant differences in performance in the clinical groups, particularity the TBI group.\nDemographic variables, particularly education level, and scores on the TOPF should be taken into consideration when interpreting performance on tests of verbal fluency and naming ability.", "The present study is conducted on 300 PG-level college students in Haridwar, Uttarakhand (India). The aim of the present study is to examine the level of spiritual intelligence and mental health, to observe relationship between these two variables and also to identify the difference in spiritual intelligence and mental health across gender and educational background (arts and science). The purposive sampling technique is used to select 300 college students of both disciplines of arts and science from the four different government degree colleges/campuses in Haridwar. Integrated Spiritual Intelligence Scale and Mithila Mental Health Status Inventory are used to observe the level of these variables among college students. In the present study, correlational design is employed. All the statistical analyses are done with the help of computer software SPSS. To observe relationship Pearson correlation and to identify the difference t test are used. Findings of the study revealed that spiritual intelligence and mental health relate significantly among arts students, and male and female arts students separately have significant relationship between spiritual intelligence and mental health. Spiritual intelligence and mental health relate significantly among science students, and male and female science students separately have significant relationship between spiritual intelligence and mental health. No significant difference is found between male and female students in terms of spiritual intelligence. No significant difference is found between arts and science students in terms of spiritual intelligence. No significant difference is found between male and female students in terms of mental health. No significant difference is found between arts and science students in terms of mental health.", "The social brain hypothesis argues that the need to deal with social challenges was key to our evolution of high intelligence. Research with non-human primates as well as experimental and fMRI studies in humans produce results consistent with this claim, leading to an estimate that human primary groups should consist of roughly 150 individuals. Gaps between this prediction and empirical observations can be partially accounted for using \"compression heuristics\", or schemata that simplify the encoding and recall of social information. However, little is known about the specific algorithmic processes used by humans to store and recall social information. We describe a mechanistic model of human network recall and demonstrate its sufficiency for capturing human recall behavior observed in experimental contexts. We find that human recall is predicated on accurate recall of a small number of high degree network nodes and the application of heuristics for both structural and affective information. This provides new insight into human memory, social network evolution, and demonstrates a novel approach to uncovering human cognitive operations.", "A link between infection, inflammation, neurodevelopment and adult illnesses has been proposed. The objective of this study was to examine the association between infection burden during childhood - a critical period of development for the immune and nervous systems - and subsequent systemic inflammatory markers and general intelligence. In the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, a prospective birth cohort in England, we examined the association of exposure to infections during childhood, assessed at seven follow-ups between age 1\u00b75 and 7\u00b75 years, with subsequent: (1) serum interleukin 6 and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels at age 9; (2) intelligence quotient (IQ) at age 8. We also examined the relationship between inflammatory markers and IQ. Very high infection burden (90+ percentile) was associated with higher CRP levels, but this relationship was explained by body mass index (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 1\u00b719; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0\u00b795-1\u00b750), maternal occupation (adjusted OR 1\u00b723; 95% CI 0\u00b798-1\u00b755) and atopic disorders (adjusted OR 1\u00b724; 95% CI 0\u00b798-1\u00b755). Higher CRP levels were associated with lower IQ; adjusted \u03b2 = -0\u00b779 (95% CI -1\u00b731 to -0\u00b727); P = 0\u00b7003. There was no strong evidence for an association between infection and IQ. The findings indicate that childhood infections do not have an independent, lasting effect on circulating inflammatory marker levels subsequently in childhood; however, elevated inflammatory markers may be harmful for intellectual development/function.", "Higher fluoride concentrations in water have inconsistently been associated with the levels of intelligence in children. The following study summarizes the available evidence regarding the strength of association between fluoridated water and children's intelligence.\nMeta-analysis.\nPubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases were systematically analyzed from November 2016. Observational studies that have reported on intelligence levels in relation to high and low water fluoride contents, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were included. Further, the results were pooled using inverse variance methods. The correlation between water fluoride concentration and intelligence level was assessed by a dose-response meta-analysis.\nTwenty-six studies reporting data on 7258 children were included. The summary results indicated that high water fluoride exposure was associated with lower intelligence levels (standardized mean difference : -0.52; 95% CI: -0.62 to -0.42; P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). The findings\u00a0from subgroup analyses were consistent with those from overall analysis. The dose-response meta-analysis suggested a significant association between water fluoride dosage and intelligence (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), while increased water fluoride exposure was associated with reduced intelligence levels.\nGreater exposure to high levels of fluoride in water was significantly associated with reduced levels of intelligence in children. Therefore, water quality and exposure to fluoride in water should be controlled in areas with high fluoride levels in water.", "This study had 2 objectives: First, to explore the gender-related differences in emotional processing (EP) and theory of mind-both cognitive (CToM) and affective (AToM)-in patients with schizophrenia and in a control group of healthy subjects; and, second, to examine, from a gender perspective, the possible association between EP and CToM in the AToM performance.\nForty patients with schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder were recruited and matched by gender, age and years of education with 40 healthy subjects. EP was measured by the pictures of facial affect (POFA) test. CToM was measured using first- and second-order false-belief (FB) stories. AToM was measured by the reading the mind in the eyes test (RMET). Group and gender differences in CToM were analysed using the X2 test, whereas EP and AToM were analysed using the non-parametric Mann-Whitney U Test and a general linear model. Results were adjusted by intelligence quotient and negative symptomatology.\nPatients with schizophrenia underperformed against healthy subjects in the POFA test, second-order FB, and RMET, but not in first-order FB. No significant gender differences were found. However, there was a trend showing that females outperformed males in the POFA ( P = 0.056). Group ( P < 0.001), POFA ( P < 0.001) and second-order FB ( P = 0.022) were the best factors predicting RMET performance (adjusted R2 = 0.584).\nOur results suggest that the illness is the main factor related to the deficit in social cognition, except for the basic aspects of the CToM that were unimpaired in most patients. Nevertheless, the influence of female gender in EP should not be neglected in any group. Finally, the hierarchal interaction between these domains is discussed.\nPremi\u00e8rement, explorer les diff\u00e9rences li\u00e9es au sexe du processus \u00e9motionnel (PE) et de la th\u00e9orie de l\u2019esprit, \u00e0 la fois cognitive (TdEC) et affective (TdEA), chez les patients souffrant de schizophr\u00e9nie et dans un groupe t\u00e9moin de sujets en sant\u00e9.

Musical abilities are known to be associated with factors like intelligence, training, and sex, but a comprehensive evaluation of the simultaneous impact of multiple factors has not yet been performed. Here, we assessed 918 healthy volunteers for pitch discrimination abilities-their ability to tell two tones close in pitch apart. We identified the minimal threshold that the participants could detect, and we found that better performance was associated with higher intelligence, East Asian ancestry, male sex, younger age, formal music training-especially before age 6-and English as the native language. All these factors remained significant when controlling for the others, with general intelligence, musical training, and male sex having the biggest impacts. We also performed a small GWAS and gene-based collapsing analysis, identifying no significant associations. Future genetic studies of musical abilities should involve large sample sizes and an unbiased genome-wide approach, with the factors highlighted here included as important covariates.", "This report summarizes data on the demographic and military characteristics of women and women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) in the active component of the U.S. Armed Forces during 2012-2016. Data on pregnancy-related care and birth rates are also presented. In 2016, WOCBP comprised the vast majority of active component service women. The largest proportions of WOCBP were in the categories of women who were 20-24 years old, non-Hispanic white, junior enlisted rank, and in a communications/intelligence occupation. WOCBP were roughly equally distributed in the Army, Navy, and Air Force, whereas only 7.5% served in the Marine Corps. Slightly more than one-quarter of WOCBP had ever deployed to the U.S. Central Command area of responsibility (CENTCOM AOR). In 2016, 13.1% of all WOCBP had at least one pregnancy-related event and 1.1% of deployed WOCBP had a pregnancy event during a deployment to CENTCOM AOR. The prevalence of pregnancy decreased slightly over the surveillance period. There were 63,879 live births during the surveillance period, for an overall live birth rate of 64.9 live births per 1,000 person-years (p-yrs). This rate of live births decreased steadily from 69.8 per 1,000 p-yrs in 2012 to 59.7 per 1,000 p-yrs in 2016. Rates of live births were highest among women who were 30-34 years old, enlisted or junior officer rank, Army, in healthcare occupations, and married. About one-quarter of the total live births were cesarean deliveries.", "Burnout is common among surgical residents and may be related to personality characteristics, emotional intelligence (EI), or work experiences.\nLongitudinal cohort study over 1 year.\nTertiary academic medical centers in the Northeast.\nAll general surgery residents in 2 programs (n = 143) were invited to complete an electronic survey at 3 time points; 88, 64, and 69 residents completed the survey (overall response rate 52%).\nSevere burnout was observed in 51% of residents (n = 41). Higher scores were associated with female sex (p = 0.02). Burnout scores were highest at the beginning and end of the academic year; EI and personality scores remained stable. On bivariate analysis, high EI score (p < 0.001), agreeableness and emotional stability personality features (p = 0.003), and positive job experiences (p < 0.01) were protective against burnout. Higher EI and positive work experiences were independent predictors of lower burnout (p < 0.01) after multivariable adjustment.\nSurgical residents have high levels of burnout. Higher EI and positive work experiences are associated with lower burnout. Focused interventions to improve EI and optimize the work environment may prevent or lessen burnout.", "With the recent exponential growth of applications using artificial intelligence (AI), the development of efficient and ultrafast brain-like (neuromorphic) systems is crucial for future information and communication technologies. While the implementation of AI systems using computer algorithms of neural networks is emerging rapidly, scientists are just taking the very first steps in the development of the hardware elements of an artificial brain, specifically neuromorphic microchips. In this review article, we present the current state of the art of neuromorphic photonic circuits based on solid-state optoelectronic oscillators formed by nanoscale double barrier quantum well resonant tunneling diodes. We address, both experimentally and theoretically, the key dynamic properties of recently developed artificial solid-state neuron microchips with delayed perturbations and describe their role in the study of neural activity and regenerative memory. This review covers our recent research work on excitable and delay dynamic characteristics of both single and autaptic (delayed) artificial neurons including all-or-none response, spike-based data encoding, storage, signal regeneration and signal healing. Furthermore, the neural responses of these neuromorphic microchips display all the signatures of extended spatio-temporal localized structures (LSs) of light, which are reviewed here in detail. By taking advantage of the dissipative nature of LSs, we demonstrate potential applications in optical data reconfiguration and clock and timing at high-speeds and with short transients. The results reviewed in this article are a key enabler for the development of high-performance optoelectronic devices in future high-speed brain-inspired optical memories and neuromorphic computing.", "Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common neurodevelopmental disease featuring executive control deficits as a prominent neuropsychological trait. Executive functions are implicated in multiple sub-networks of the brain; however, few studies examine these sub-networks as a whole in ADHD. By combining resting-state functional MRI and graph-based approaches, we systematically investigated functional connectivity patterns among four control-related networks, including the frontoparietal network (FPN), cingulo-opercular network, cerebellar network, and default mode network (DMN), in 46 drug-naive children with ADHD and 31 age-, gender-, and intelligence quotient-matched healthy controls (HCs). Compared to the HCs, the ADHD children showed significantly decreased functional connectivity that primarily involved the DMN and FPN regions and cross-network long-range connections. Further graph-based network analysis revealed that the ADHD children had fewer connections, lower network efficiency, and more functional modules compared with the HCs. The ADHD-related alterations in functional connectivity but not topological organization were correlated with clinical symptoms of the ADHD children and differentiated the patients from the HCs with a good performance. Taken together, our findings suggest a less-integrated functional brain network in children with ADHD due to selective disruption of key long-range connections, with important implications for understanding the neural substrates of ADHD, particularly executive dysfunction.", "To determine whether tight glycemic control of neonatal hyperglycemia changes neurodevelopment, growth, and metabolism at school age.\nChildren born very low birth weight and randomized as hyperglycemic neonates to a trial of tight vs standard glycemic control were assessed at 7 years corrected age, including Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children Fourth Edition, Movement Assessment Battery for Children 2, visual and neurologic examinations, growth measures, dual X-ray absorptiometry, and frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test. The primary outcome was survival without neurodevelopmental impairment at age 7 years. Outcomes were compared using linear regression, adjusted for sex, small for gestational age, birth plurality, and the clustering of twins. Data are reported as number (%) or mean (SD).\nOf the 88 infants randomized, 11 (13%) had died and 57 (74% of eligible children) were assessed at corrected age 7 years. Survival without neurodevelopmental impairment occurred in 25 of 68 children (37%), with no significant difference between tight (14 of 35; 40%) and standard (11 of 33; 33%) glycemic control groups (P\u2009=\u2009.60). Children in the tight group were shorter than those in the standard group (121.3 [6.3] cm vs 125.1 [5.4] cm; P\u2009<\u2009.05), but had similar weight and head circumference. Children in the tight group had greater height-adjusted lean mass (18.7 [0.3] vs 17.6 [0.2] kg; P\u2009<\u2009.01) and lower fasting glucose concentrations (84.6 [6.30] vs 90.0 [5.6] mg\u22c5dL-1; P\u2009<\u2009.05), but no other differences in measures of body composition or insulin-glucose metabolism.\nTight glycemic control for neonatal hyperglycemia does not change survival without neurodevelopmental impairment, but reduces height, increases height-adjusted lean mass, and reduces fasting blood glucose concentrations at school age.\nACTRN: 12606000270516.", "We present a contemporary analysis of patient injury, allegations, and contributing factors of anesthesia-related closed claims, which involved cases that specifically occurred in free-standing ambulatory surgery centers (ASCs).\nWe examined ASC-closed claims data between 2007 and 2014 from The Doctors Company, a medical malpractice insurer. Findings were coded using the Comprehensive Risk Intelligence Tool developed by CRICO Strategies. We compared coded data from ASC claims with hospital operating room (HOR) claims, in terms of injury severity category, nature of injury, nature of allegation, contributing factors identified, and contributing comorbidities and claim value.\nAmbulatory surgery center claims were more likely to be classified as medium severity than HOR claims, more likely to involve dental damage or pain than HOR claims, but less likely to involve death or respiratory or cardiac arrest. Technical performance was the most common contributing factor: 47% of ASCs and 48% of HORs. Only 7% of allegations relating to technical performance were judged to be a direct result of poor technical performance. The most common anesthesia procedures resulting in ASC claims were injection of anesthesia into a peripheral nerve (34%) and intubation (29%). Obesity was the most common contributing comorbidity in both settings. Mean closed claim value was significantly lower for ASC than HOR claims, averaging US $87,888 versus $107,325.\nAnalysis of ASC and HOR claims demonstrates significant differences and several common sources of liability. These include improving strategies for thorough screening, preoperative assessment and risk stratifying of patients, incorporating routine dental and airway assessment and documentation, diagnosing and treating perioperative pain adequately, and improving the efficacy of communication between patients and care providers.", "Detection of intellectual disability (ID) in the penitentiary system is important for the following reasons: (a) to provide assistance to people with ID in understanding their legal rights and court proceedings; (b) to facilitate rehabilitation programs tailored to ID patients, which improves the enhancement of their quality of life and reduces their risk of reoffending; and (c) to provide a reliable estimate of the risk of offence recidivism. It requires a short assessment instrument that provides a reliable estimation of a person's intellectual functioning at the earliest possible stage of this process. The aim of this systematic review is (a) to provide an overview of recent short assessment instruments that provide a full-scale IQ score in adult prison populations and (b) to achieve a quality measurement of the validation studies regarding these instruments to determine which tests are most feasible in this target population. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses Statement is used to ensure reliability. The Satz-M\u00f6gel, an item-reduction short form of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, shows the highest correlation with the golden standard and is described to be most reliable. Nevertheless, when it comes to applicability in prison populations, the shorter and less verbal Quick Test can be preferred over others. Without affecting these conclusions, major limitations emerge from the present systematic review, which give rise to several important recommendations for further research.", "Emotional intelligence is highly relevant in palliative care training, considering the coping styles used by nursing students. Clinical simulation provides the opportunity to evaluate these variables in a realistic and natural context.\nTo analyze the possible relation between emotional intelligence, coping styles and satisfaction with one's own self-learning in nursing students participating in simulated scenarios related to palliative care at the end of life.\nA descriptive, observational and correlational study of students in their second year of nursing at a Spanish University during the 2015/2016 academic year. Three variables were measured: emotional intelligence (Trait Meta-Mood Scale-24), coping styles (the Questionnaire for Dealing with Stress) and satisfaction with students' own learning (Student Satisfaction and Self-Confidence in Learning Scale, Spanish version CSLS-Sv).\nIn total, 74 students participated in this study (ME: 20.3years). An association was found between satisfaction with learning, according to the EI attention subscale (in which the highest scores were registered) and two specific coping styles (FSP, with high scores and open emotional expression).\nEmotional intelligence and coping styles are desirable qualities in students, especially as they have a relevant role in satisfaction with one's own learning. Nonetheless, in part, these results depend on the characteristics of the educational activities designed, which is especially relevant in simulation applied to palliative care.", "The presence of pedophilic sexual interests is considered of high importance for predicting recidivism among individuals who have committed sexual offenses. However, objective and valid assessment methods that are robust against confounding issues such as cognitive capacity and manipulation are sparse. We applied the Approach-Avoidance Task (AAT) for detecting sexual interests in 38 pedophilic men (18 primarily attracted to boys) and 27 male nonpedophilic (11 gay) participants. The AAT relies on automatic approach and avoidance tendencies, independent of cognitive abilities such as memory capacity and intelligence. Approach-avoidance tendencies toward stimuli depicting seminude prepubescent boys and girls as well as men and women are reported. The results were consistent with previous research on the utility of the AAT: Except for pedophiles attracted to girls, the mean AAT scores (approach minus avoidance reaction time for each stimulus category) were positive only for stimuli of the preferred category. A multivariate binary logistic regression approach revealed 80% overall accuracy in differentiating pedophilic from nonpedophilic participants.", "Acromelic dysplasia is a heterogeneous group of rare skeletal dysplasias characterized by distal limb shortening. Weill-Marchesani syndrome (WMS), Geleophysic dysplasia (GD) and Acromicric dysplasia (AD) are clinically distinct entities within this group of disorders and are characterized by short stature, short hands, stiff joints, skin thickening, facial anomalies, normal intelligence and skeletal abnormalities. Mutations of the Fibrillin-1 (FBN1) gene have been reported to cause AD, GD and related phenotypes. We reported three families with acromelic short stature. FBN1 analysis showed that all affected individuals carry a heterozygous missense mutation c.5284G\u00a0>\u00a0A (p.Gly1762Ser) in exon 42 of the FBN1 gene. This mutation was previously reported to be associated with GD. We reviewed the literature and compared the clinical features of the patients with FBN1 mutations to those with A Distintegrin And Metalloproteinase with Thrombospondin repeats-like 2 gene (ADAMTSL2) mutations. We found that tip-toeing gait, long flat philtrum and thin upper upper lip were more consistently found in GD patients with ADAMTSL2 mutations than in those with FBN1 mutations. The results have shed some light on the phenotype-genotype correlation in this group of skeletal disorders. A large scale study involving multidisciplinary collaboration would be needed to consolidate our findings.", "This is a very exciting time for medicine. We are witnessing the creation of a new approach to the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease. It is an omnigenic approach-powered by systems biology-to assembling patient-specific information about how genes and lifestyle interact. When combined with other new technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning informatics, the result will be the development of a precision form of personalized lifestyle medicine applied to cardiovascular disease. This advancement will be a gateway for change throughout the entire segment of the health care system that is focused on the many complex chronic conditions affecting our world population.", "Pseudohypoparathyroidism 1A (PHP1A) is a rare, genetic disorder. Most patients with PHP1A have cognitive impairment but this has not been systematically studied. We hypothesized that children with PHP1A would have lower intelligent quotient (IQ) scores than controls. To evaluate cognition and behavior, we prospectively enrolled children with PHP1A, one unaffected sibling (when available) and controls matched on BMI/age/gender/race. Evaluations included cognitive and executive function testing. Parents completed questionnaires on behavior and executive function. We enrolled 16 patients with PHP1A, 8 unaffected siblings, and 15 controls. Results are presented as mean (SD). The PHP1A group had a composite IQ of 85.9 (17.2); 25% had a composite IQ\u2009<\u2009-2\u2009SD. The PHP1A group had significantly lower IQs than matched controls (composite IQ -17.3, 95%CI -28.1 to -6.5, p\u2009<\u20090.01) and unaffected siblings (composite IQ -21.5, 95%CI -33.9 to -9.1, p\u2009<\u20090.01). Special education services were utilized for 93% of the patients with PHP1A. Deficits were observed in executive function and parents reported delayed adaptive behavior skills and increased rates of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. In conclusion, children with PHP1A have lower intelligence quotient scores, poorer executive function, delayed adaptive behavior skills, and increased behavior problems.", "Introduction: Gender dysphoria (GD) (DMS-5) is a condition marked by increasing psychological suffering that accompanies the incongruence between one's experienced or expressed gender and one's assigned gender. Manifestation of GD can be seen early on during childhood and adolescence. During this period, the development of undesirable sexual characteristics marks an acute suffering of being opposite to the sex of birth. Pubertal suppression with gonadotropin releasing hormone analogs (GnRHa) has been proposed for these individuals as a reversible treatment for postponing the pubertal development and attenuating psychological suffering. Recently, increased interest has been observed on the impact of this treatment on brain maturation, cognition and psychological performance. Objectives: The aim of this clinical report is to review the effects of puberty suppression on the brain white matter (WM) during adolescence. WM Fractional anisotropy, voice and cognitive functions were assessed before and during the treatment. MRI scans were acquired before, and after 22 and 28 months of hormonal suppression. Methods: We performed a longitudinal evaluation of a pubertal transgender girl undergoing hormonal treatment with GnRH analog. Three longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were performed for diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), regarding Fractional Anisotropy (FA) for regions of interest analysis. In parallel, voice samples for acoustic analysis as well as executive functioning with the Wechsler Intelligence Scale (WISC-IV) were performed. Results: During the follow-up, white matter fractional anisotropy did not increase, compared to normal male puberty effects on the brain. After 22 months of pubertal suppression, operational memory dropped 9 points and remained stable after 28 months of follow-up. The fundamental frequency of voice varied during the first year; however, it remained in the female range. Conclusion: Brain white matter fractional anisotropy remained unchanged in the GD girl during pubertal suppression with GnRHa for 28 months, which may be related to the reduced serum testosterone levels and/or to the patient's baseline low average cognitive performance.Global performance on the Weschler scale was slightly lower during pubertal suppression compared to baseline, predominantly due to a reduction in operational memory. Either a baseline of low average cognition or the hormonal status could play a role in cognitive performance during pubertal suppression. The voice pattern during the follow-up seemed to reflect testosterone levels under suppression by GnRHa treatment.", "Human figure drawing tasks such as the Draw-a-Person test have long been used to assess intelligence (F. Goodenough, 1926). The authors investigate the skills tapped by drawing and the risk factors associated with poor drawing. Self-portraits of 345 preschool children were scored by raters trained in using the Draw-a-Person Intellectual Ability test (DAP:IQ) rubric (C. R. Reynolds & J. A. Hickman, 2004). Analyses of children's fine motor, gross motor, social, cognitive, and language skills revealed that only fine motor skill was an independent predictor of DAP:IQ scores. Being a boy and having a low birth weight were associated with lower DAP:IQ scores. These findings suggest that although the DAP:IQ may not be a valid measure of cognitive ability, it may be a useful screening tool for fine motor disturbances in at-risk children, such as boys who were born at low birth weights. Furthermore, researchers who use human figure drawing tasks to measure intelligence should measure fine motor skill in addition to intelligence.", "Social comparison plays an important role in our daily life. Several studies have investigated the neural mechanism of social comparison; however, their conclusions remain controversial. The present study explored the neural correlates of intelligence comparison and nonsocial size comparison using functional magnetic resonance imaging and a distance effect paradigm. We found that both intelligence and size comparisons obeyed the behavioral distance effect-longer response times for near than far distances and this effect involved an overlapping frontal network including the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex and insula. In addition, compared with size comparisons, intelligence comparisons elicited increased activity in the precuneus and angular gyrus, but decreased activity in the inferior parietal lobe. Furthermore, the analysis of seed-based functional connectivity complemented these neural commonalities and differences. Our findings suggest that social and nonsocial comparisons may rely on a common core mechanism, but this mechanism may be supplemented by different domain-specific cognitive components.", "Individuals born preterm with very low birth weight (VLBW; birth weight\u00a0\u2264\u00a01500\u00a0g) are at high risk for perinatal brain injuries and deviant brain development, leading to increased chances of later cognitive, emotional, and behavioral problems. Here we investigated the neuronal underpinnings of both reactive and proactive cognitive control processes in adults with VLBW. We included 32 adults born preterm with VLBW (before 37th week of gestation) and 32 term-born controls (birth weight \u226510th percentile for gestational age) between 22 and 24 years of age that have been followed prospectively since birth. Participants performed a well-validated Not-X continuous performance test (CPT) adapted for use in a mixed block- and event-related fMRI protocol. BOLD fMRI and DTI data was acquired on a 3T scanner. Performance on the Not-X CPT was highly similar between groups. However, the VLBW group demonstrated hyper-reactive cognitive control processing and disrupted white matter organization. The hyper-reactive brain activation signature in VLBW adults was associated with lower gestational age, lower fluid intelligence score, and anxiety problems. Automated Multi-Atlas Tract Extraction (AutoMATE) analyses revealed that this disruption of normal brain function was accompanied by poorer white matter organization in the anterior thalamic radiation and the cingulum, as reflected in both reduced fractional anisotropy and increased mean diffusivity. These findings show that the preterm behavioral phenotype is associated with predominantly reactive-, rather than proactive cognitive control processing, as well as white matter abnormalities, that may underlie common difficulties that many preterm born individuals experience in everyday life.", "Research into the causal and perpetuating factors influencing aggression has partly focused on the general tendency of aggression-prone individuals to infer hostile intent in others, even in ambiguous circumstances. This is referred to as the 'hostile interpretation bias'. Whether this hostile interpretation bias also exists in basal information processing, such as perception of facial emotion, is not yet known, especially with respect to the perception of ambiguous expressions. In addition, little is known about how this potential bias in facial emotion perception is related to specific characteristics of aggression. In the present study, conducted in a penitentiary setting with detained male adults, we investigated if violent offenders (n = 71) show a stronger tendency to interpret ambiguous facial expressions on a computer task as angry rather than happy, compared to non-violent offenders (n = 14) and to a control group of healthy volunteers (n = 32). We also investigated if hostile perception of facial expressions is related to specific characteristics of aggression, such as proactive and reactive aggression. No clear statistical evidence was found that violent offenders perceived facial emotional expressions as more angry than non-violent offenders or healthy volunteers. A regression analysis in the violent offender group showed that only age and a self-report measure of hostility predicted outcome on the emotion perception task. Other traits, such as psychopathic traits, intelligence, attention and a tendency to jump to conclusions were not associated with interpretation of anger in facial emotional expressions. We discuss the possible impact of the study design and population studied on our results, as well as implications for future studies.", "Earlier research has identified a remarkable number of related factors to resilience during adolescence. Historically, theoretical treatments of resilience have been focused almost exclusively on psychosocial levels of analysis to derive explanatory models. However, there is insufficient understanding of the role of emotion regulation explaining competent functioning despite the experience of adversity (resilience), especially during adolescence. This study explores the relationship between both, emotional regulation abilities and strategies, and resilience in a sample of adolescents from suburbs high-schools (Jerez de la Frontera, Spain). The study also examines how using different emotional regulation strategies may help the development of resilience levels at this stage. Participants of the study were 164 adolescents ranging from 13 to 16 years old (M = 13.98; SD = 0.66). Emotion regulation was measured using the Cognitive Emotional Regulation Questionnaire (CERQ, Garnefski et al., 2001), and sections D and H of Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test, a performance test (Emotion Regulation Ability sections, MSCEIT, Spanish version, Mayer et al., 2003). Resilience was evaluated with ERE (Educative Resilience Scale for children and adolescents, Saavedra and Castro, 2009). Verbal Intelligence (Yuste, 1997) and personality traits (Cattell and Cattell, 1986) were assessed as two independent variables. Results supported the idea that emotion regulation ability (MSCEIT, D and H sections, Extremera et al., 2006) is a significant predictor of adolescents' resilience. Moreover, cognitive regulation strategies, such as positive reappraisal, predicted perceived resilience among students. Sociability (A factor of HSPQ, sociability) also correlated with resilience levels. Hence, these results are promising, implying that emotion regulation ability may act as a helpful tool preventing adolescents from irrational risky behaviors, commonly assumed at this developmental stage.", "Sj\u00f6gren-Larsson syndrome is a rare neurocutaneous disorder characterized by ichthyosis, spastic diplegia or tetraplegia, and intellectual disability. Herein, we describe a case of a Greek patient with ichthyosis and spasticity of the legs but with normal intelligence (IQ 95). This syndrome should be suspected when a child presents with ichthyosis and spastic diplegia or tetraplegia, even if intelligence is normal.", "Ethical care is a core value in nursing. Pediatric nurses are in direct and continuous contact with children and their parents. They manage their lives and health. As part of the pediatric nurses' daily work, ethical issues play an important role in making decisions, are important to make decisions, and this capability is only achieved by ethical practice. This study aimed to explore the factors facilitating the learning of ethical practice among Iranian pediatric nurses.\nThis study is a conventional qualitative content analysis based on the Graneheim and Lundman method. It was conducted through semi-structured interviews with two focus groups, incorporating 28 nurses working in pediatric wards. Unstructured observation and field notes were other methods of data collection. Purposive sampling continued until data saturation was ensured. All interviews were tape recorded and transcribed in verbatim.\nThree main categories and 12 subcategories emerged from this study. The facilitating factors include (1) individual competencies (knowledge, experience, emotional intelligence, and loving children), (2) ethical imprinting (responsibility, reflection, empathy, and ethical beliefs), and (3) an environment that nurtures moral values (organizational, spiritual, family, and cultural environments) as facilitating factors.\nThe promotion of nurses' competencies, ethical virtues, and imprinting, as well as improvement of the quality of nursing care must be the top priority of the health team. Undoubtedly, the success of the health care system is not possible without ensuring that pediatric nurses learn ethical practices.", "Multiple sclerosis (MS), a chronic disease of the central nervous system (CNS), causing progressive nerve damage, has disabling symptoms, and undermines self-efficacy beliefs. Due to the importance of self-efficacy modified in adaptation and coping with stress, this study was conducted with the aim to investigate the effect of emotional intelligence training on self-efficacy in women with MS.\nThis randomized clinical trial was conducted on 70 women referring to the Multiple Sclerosis Clinic of Kashani Hospital, Isfahan, Iran. The participants were randomly assigned to two groups through minimization method. In the experimental group, emotional intelligence training was performed within 8 weeks, once a week for 90 minutes, in groups of 8-9 individuals. Data were collected using the Multiple Sclerosis Self-efficacy Scale (MSSS) before, immediately after, and 3 months after the intervention in both groups. Data were analyzed using independent t-test and repeated measures ANOVA in SPSS.\nThe results of independent t-test showed no significant difference between the groups in terms of mean self-efficacy scores before the intervention (p > 0.05). However, there was a significant difference between the groups in this regard immediately after and 3 months after the intervention (p < 0.05). Repeated measures ANOVA showed a significant difference in the mean score of self-efficacy and its components between the groups at different times (p < 0.05).\nIt seems that emotional intelligence training is effective on the improvement of self-efficacy of women with MS. Hence, this method can be recommended as an effective and affordable technique.", "Genetic association studies routinely require many thousands of participants to achieve sufficient power, yet accumulation of large well-assessed samples is costly. We describe here an effort to efficiently measure cognitive ability and personality in an online genetic study, Genes for Good. We report on the first 21,550 participants with relevant phenotypic data, 7,458 of whom have been genotyped genome-wide. Measures of crystallized and fluid intelligence reflected a two-dimensional latent ability space, with items demonstrating adequate item-level characteristics. The Big Five Inventory questionnaire revealed the expected five-factor model of personality. Cognitive measures predicted educational attainment over and above personality characteristics, as expected. We found that a genome-wide polygenic score of educational attainment predicted educational level, accounting for 4%, 4%, and 2.7% of the variance in educational attainment, verbal reasoning, and spatial reasoning, respectively. In summary, the online cognitive measures in Genes for Good appear to perform adequately and demonstrate expected associations with personality, education, and an education-based polygenic score. Results indicate that online cognitive assessment is one avenue to accumulate large samples of individuals for genetic research of cognitive ability.", "Patients with schizophrenia usually show an impairment in their communicative-pragmatic performance; they also have difficulties in cognitive functioning and Theory of Mind (ToM). In the literature it has been proposed that ToM and cognitive deficits have a role in explaining the communicative-pragmatic difficulties of patients with schizophrenia. However, the exact interplay of these functions is still not completely clear. The present research investigates the relationship between communicative-pragmatic, ToM and cognitive impairments (i.e. general intelligence, selective attention, speed processing and EF -working memory, inhibition and flexibility-) in a sample of 26 individuals with schizophrenia and matched controls. The linguistic and extralinguistic scales of the Assessment Battery of Communication (ABaCo), and a series of ToM and cognitive tasks were administered to patients and healthy controls. The results showed that individuals with schizophrenia performed less well than controls in all the tasks investigated. However, a hierarchical regression analysis showed that only ToM, and not cognitive functions, seems to be a predictive variable of patients' performance. Finally, a Fisher's exact test showed that there was not a stable significant relationship between ToM or EF and pragmatic impairment.", "The American Psychological Association (APA) began 125 years ago as a small club of a few dozen members in the parlor of its founder, G. Stanley Hall. In the decades since, it has faced many difficulties and even a few existential crises. Originally a scientific society, it spent the decades between the world wars figuring out how to accommodate the growing community of applied psychologists while still retaining and enhancing its scientific reputation. After World War II, with an expanded mandate, it developed formal training models for clinical psychologists and became an important player in legal cases pertaining to civil rights and other social justice issues. With practitioners taking an ever-greater role in the governance of the organization in the late 1970s, and the financial viability of the association in doubt in the 1980s, many psychological scientists felt the need to create a separate organization for themselves. The 1990s and early 2000s brought more challenges: declining divisional memberships; a legal dispute over fees with practitioners; and a serious upheaval over the APA Board of Directors' cooperation with governmental defense and intelligence agencies during the \"war on terror.\" These clashes appear to have precipitated a decline in the association's membership for the first time in its history. The APA has faced many storms over its century-and-a-quarter, but has, thus far, always ultimately found a way forward for itself, for its members, and for the wider discipline of psychology. (PsycINFO Database Record", "Big data analysis is receiving increasing attention in many industries, including healthcare. Visualization plays an important role not only in intuitively showing the results of data analysis but also in the whole process of collecting, cleaning, analyzing, and sharing data. This paper presents a procedure for the interactive visualization and analysis of healthcare data using Tableau as a business intelligence tool.\nStarting with installation of the Tableau Desktop Personal version 10.3, this paper describes the process of understanding and visualizing healthcare data using an example. The example data of colon cancer patients were obtained from health insurance claims in years 2012 and 2013, provided by the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service.\nTo explore the visualization of healthcare data using Tableau for beginners, this paper describes the creation of a simple view for the average length of stay of colon cancer patients. Since Tableau provides various visualizations and customizations, the level of analysis can be increased with small multiples, view filtering, mark cards, and Tableau charts.\nTableau is a software that can help users explore and understand their data by creating interactive visualizations. The software has the advantages that it can be used in conjunction with almost any database, and it is easy to use by dragging and dropping to create an interactive visualization expressing the desired format.", "General intelligence is a psychological construct that captures in a single metric the overall level of behavioural and cognitive performance in an individual. While previous research has attempted to localise intelligence in circumscribed brain regions, more recent work focuses on functional interactions between regions. However, even though brain networks are characterised by substantial modularity, it is unclear whether and how the brain's modular organisation is associated with general intelligence. Modelling subject-specific brain\u00a0network graphs from functional MRI resting-state data (N\u2009=\u2009309), we found that intelligence was not associated with global modularity features (e.g., number or size of modules) or the whole-brain proportions of different node types (e.g., connector hubs or provincial hubs). In contrast, we observed characteristic associations between intelligence and node-specific measures of within- and between-module connectivity, particularly in frontal and parietal brain regions that have previously been linked to intelligence. We propose that the connectivity profile of these regions may shape intelligence-relevant aspects of information processing. Our data demonstrate that not only region-specific differences in brain structure and function, but also the network-topological embedding of fronto-parietal as well as other cortical and subcortical brain regions is related to individual differences in higher cognitive abilities, i.e., intelligence.", "This study examined whether late-preterm birth (34+0 to 36+6wks+d gestational age) was associated with neurocognitive deficit in young adulthood, and whether small for gestational age (SGA) birth amplified any adversity.\nParticipants derived from the prospective regional cohort study, the Arvo Ylpp\u00f6 Longitudinal Study (n=786; 398 females, 388 males) (mean age 25y 4mo, SD 8mo), born 1985 to 1986 late-preterm (n=119; 21 SGA, <-2 SD) and at term (37+0 to 41+6wks+d; n=667; 28 SGA) underwent tests of intelligence, executive functioning, attention, and memory, and reported their education.\nThose born late-preterm scored -3.71 (95% confidence interval [CI] -6.71 to -0.72) and -3.11 (95% CI -6.01 to -0.22) points lower on Full-scale and Verbal IQ than peers born at term. Compared with those born at term and appropriate for gestational age (\u2265-2 to <2 SD) Full-scale, Verbal, and Performance IQ scores of those born late-preterm and SGA were -9.45 to -11.84 points lower. After adjustments, differences were rendered non-significant, except that scores in Full-scale and Performance IQ remained lower among those born late-preterm and SGA.\nLate-preterm birth, per se, may not increase the risk of poorer neurocognitive functioning in adulthood. But the double burden of being born late-preterm and SGA seems to increase this risk.\nLate-preterm birth did not increase the risk of poorer neurocognitive functioning in adulthood. But the double burden of being born late-preterm and being small for gestational age did increase this risk.", "Optic nerve hypoplasia (ONH) is a congenital ocular malformation that has been associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, but the prevalence in unilateral disease and less severe visual impairment is unknown. We studied intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) in patients with ONH.\nThis was a population-based cross-sectional cohort study of 65 patients (33 female) with ONH below 20 years of age, living in Stockholm in December 2009, with data analysed in January 2016. Of these 35 were bilateral and 30 were unilateral. Neurodevelopmental disorders were diagnosed or confirmed by neurological assessments, the Five to Fifteen parent questionnaire and reviewing previous neuropsychological investigations or conducting neuropsychological tests.\nBilateral ONH patients had lower mean full scale intelligence quotient scores than unilateral patients (84.4 and 99.4, respectively, p = 0.049). We assessed intellectual disability in 55 eligible patients, and it was more common in patients with bilateral ONH (18 of 32, 56%) than unilateral ONH (two of 23, 9%, p < 0.001). ASDs were diagnosed in seven of 42 (17%) patients.\nChildren with bilateral ONH had a high risk of neurodevelopmental disorders, especially intellectual disability. The risk was lower in unilateral ONH, but the levels of neurodevelopmental disorders warrant screening of both groups.", "Most biological mechanisms involve more than one type of biomolecule, and hence operate not solely at the level of either genome, transcriptome, proteome, metabolome or ionome. Datasets resulting from single-omic analysis are rapidly increasing in throughput and quality, rendering multi-omic studies feasible. These should offer a comprehensive, structured and interactive overview of a biological mechanism. However, combining single-omic datasets in a meaningful manner has so far proved challenging, and the discovery of new biological information lags behind expectation. One reason is that experiments conducted in different laboratories can typically not to be combined without restriction. Second, the interpretation of multi-omic datasets represents a significant challenge by nature, as the biological datasets are heterogeneous not only for technical, but also for biological, chemical, and physical reasons. Here, multi-layer network theory and methods of artificial intelligence might contribute to solve these problems. For the efficient application of machine learning however, biological datasets need to become more systematic, more precise - and much larger. We conclude our review with basic guidelines for the successful set-up of a multi-omic experiment.", "Oxytocin is a peptide hormone that influences the integration of social cognition with behavior and affect regulation. Oxytocin also prominently directs the transition of neuronal GABA neurotransmission from excitatory to inhibitory after birth. The oxytocin receptor (OXTR) is linked to schizophrenia, a heterogeneous syndrome. Relationships of OXTR polymorphisms with specific clinical features could aid in evaluating any role of oxytocin in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia.\nSchizophrenia cases with rare missense coding OXTR single nucleotide variants (SNVs) were identified from a well-characterized sample of cases and controls who were assessed for symptoms, cognition and early life trauma.\nFive of 48 cases showed rare OXTR variants. Compared to the other cases they had less severe negative symptoms (deficits in emotional expression and motivation) and less severe general psychopathology scores (depression and anxiety). They demonstrated lower nonverbal (performance) than verbal intelligence due to deficient perceptual organization and slow processing speed. They also reported greater early trauma exposure (physical and sexual abuse and emotional trauma).\nCases carrying rare OXTR SNVs had less negative and affective symptoms than other cases, but similar psychotic symptoms, along with specific cognitive deficits. The clinical characterization of these cases occurred in association with environmental exposure to early trauma, especially sexual abuse, which may have influenced the expression of schizophrenia in subjects harboring specific SNVs in the OXTR.", "Music and language share many attributes and a large body of evidence shows that sensitivity to acoustic cues in music is positively related to language development and even subsequent reading acquisition. However, such association was mainly found in alphabetic languages. What remains unclear is whether sensitivity to acoustic cues in music is associated with reading in Chinese, a morphosyllabic language. The present study aimed to answer this question by measuring music (i.e., musical metric perception and pitch discrimination), language (i.e., phonological awareness, lexical tone sensitivity), and reading abilities (i.e., word recognition) among 54 third-grade Chinese-English bilingual children. After controlling for age and non-verbal intelligence, we found that both musical metric perception and pitch discrimination accounted for unique variance of Chinese phonological awareness while pitch discrimination rather than musical metric perception predicted Chinese lexical tone sensitivity. More importantly, neither musical metric perception nor pitch discrimination was associated with Chinese reading. As for English, musical metric perception and pitch discrimination were correlated with both English phonological awareness and English reading. Furthermore, sensitivity to acoustic cues in music was associated with English reading through the mediation of English phonological awareness. The current findings indicate that the association between sensitivity to acoustic cues in music and reading may be modulated by writing systems. In Chinese, the mapping between orthography and phonology is not as transparent as in alphabetic languages such as English. Thus, this opaque mapping may alter the auditory perceptual sensitivity in music to Chinese reading.", "Visual short-term memory (vSTM) is a cognitive resource that declines with age. This study investigated whether electroencephalography (EEG) correlates of vSTM vary with cognitive development over individuals' lifespan. We measured vSTM performance and EEG in a lateralized whole-report task in a healthy birth cohort, whose cognitive function (intelligence quotient) was assessed in youth and late-middle age. Higher vSTM capacity (K; measured by Bundesen's theory of visual attention) was associated with higher amplitudes of the contralateral delay activity (CDA) and the central positivity (CP). In addition, rightward hemifield asymmetry of vSTM (K\u03bb) was associated with lower CDA amplitudes. Furthermore, more severe cognitive decline from young adulthood to late-middle age predicted higher CDA amplitudes, and the relationship between K and the CDA was less reliable in individuals who show higher levels of cognitive decline compared to individuals with preserved abilities. By contrast, there was no significant effect of lifespan cognitive changes on the CP or the relationship between behavioral measures of vSTM and the CP. Neither the CDA, nor the CP, nor the relationships between K or K\u03bb and the event-related potentials were predicted by individuals' current cognitive status. Together, our findings indicate complex age-related changes in processes underlying behavioral and EEG measures of vSTM and suggest that the K-CDA relationship might be a marker of cognitive lifespan trajectories.", "An enduring aim of research in the psychological and brain sciences is to understand the nature of individual differences in human intelligence, examining the stunning breadth and diversity of intellectual abilities and the remarkable neurobiological mechanisms from which they arise. This Opinion article surveys recent neuroscience evidence to elucidate how general intelligence, g, emerges from individual differences in the network architecture of the human brain. The reviewed findings motivate new insights about how network topology and dynamics account for individual differences in g, represented by the Network Neuroscience Theory. According to this framework, g emerges from the small-world topology of brain networks and the dynamic reorganization of its community structure in the service of system-wide flexibility and adaptation.", "Studies over the past three decades have shown that learning difficulties are not only determined by neurological disorders, but also by motivational and/or socio-cognitive factors Among these factors, implicit theories of intelligence (also referred to as conceptions, mindsets or beliefs about intelligence) are key elements. The belief that intelligence is fixed (entity theory), as opposed to malleable (incremental theory), is generally associated with negative teaching practices and poorer student outcomes, yet beliefs about the intelligence of individuals with intellectual disabilities have not received much attention. We propose the first study on conceptions of intelligence of persons with intellectual disabilities, here people with Down syndrome. Participants were 55 professionally qualified people working with individuals with intellectual disabilities and 81 adults from the community. We compared what both groups of participants believe about intelligence of typical people and what they believe about the intelligence of individuals with Down syndrome. We also investigated implicit theories of intelligence as predictors of explicit judgments about intelligence and implicit attitudes toward people with Down syndrome. Whatever the work experience in the field of intellectual disability, implicit theories of intelligence were found to be less incremental when considering people with Down syndrome than when considering typical people; and the stronger the belief in entity theory, the more negative (and less positive) the judgments expressed explicitly. Implicit theories of intelligence were also found to be predictors of negative implicit attitude but only in adults from the community. These findings offer prospects for improving practices by people working in the field of intellectual disability. They might interest a wide range of people caring for people with intellectual disabilities, such as teachers, but also other professional caregivers, and other scientists focusing on intellectual disabilities or social cognition.", "Objective: The purpose of this research is to geographically model airborne lead emission concentrations and total lead deposition in the Detroit Metropolitan Area (DMA) from 2006 to 2013. Further, this study characterizes the racial and socioeconomic composition of recipient neighborhoods and estimates the potential for IQ (Intelligence Quotient) loss of children residing there. Methods: Lead emissions were modeled from emitting facilities in the DMA using AERMOD (American Meteorological Society/Environmental Protection Agency Regulatory Model). Multilevel modeling was used to estimate local racial residential segregation, controlling for poverty. Global Moran's I bivariate spatial autocorrelation statistics were used to assess modeled emissions with increasing segregation. Results: Lead emitting facilities were primarily located in, and moving to, highly black segregated neighborhoods regardless of poverty levels-a phenomenon known as environmental injustice. The findings from this research showed three years of elevated airborne emission concentrations in these neighborhoods to equate to a predicted 1.0 to 3.0 reduction in IQ points for children living there. Across the DMA there are many areas where annual lead deposition was substantially higher than recommended for aquatic (rivers, lakes, etc.) and terrestrial (forests, dunes, etc.) ecosystems. These lead levels result in decreased reproductive and growth rates in plants and animals, and neurological deficits in vertebrates. Conclusions: This lead-hazard and neighborhood context assessment will inform future childhood lead exposure studies and potential health consequences in the DMA.", "Brain white matter hyperintensities are seen on routine clinical imaging in 46% of adults with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). The extent and functional relevance of these abnormalities have not been studied with quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) analysis.\nTo examine white matter microstructure, neural volumes, and central nervous system (CNS) metabolites in CAH due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency (21OHD) and to determine whether identified abnormalities are associated with cognition, glucocorticoid, and androgen exposure.\nA cross-sectional study at a tertiary hospital including 19 women (18 to 50 years) with 21OHD and 19 age-matched healthy women.\nRecruits underwent cognitive assessment and brain imaging, including diffusion weighted imaging of white matter, T1-weighted volumetry, and magnetic resonance spectroscopy for neural metabolites. We evaluated white matter microstructure by using tract-based spatial statistics. We compared cognitive scores, neural volumes, and metabolites between groups and relationships between glucocorticoid exposure, MRI, and neurologic outcomes.\nPatients with 21OHD had widespread reductions in white matter structural integrity, reduced volumes of right hippocampus, bilateral thalami, cerebellum, and brainstem, and reduced mesial temporal lobe total choline content. Working memory, processing speed, and digit span and matrix reasoning scores were reduced in patients with 21OHD, despite similar education and intelligence to controls. Patients with 21OHD exposed to higher glucocorticoid doses had greater abnormalities in white matter microstructure and cognitive performance.\nWe demonstrate that 21OHD and current glucocorticoid replacement regimens have a profound impact on brain morphology and function. If reversible, these CNS markers are a potential target for treatment.", "The authors present a case of Fragile X syndrome (FXS) in siblings from an Indian family with no developmental delay in previous generations. The boy presented with developmental delay, autistic features and defiant behaviours that raised clinical suspicion. He also had congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH). Social anxiety and difficulty in making friends were the subtle features in his sister with dull normal intelligence. FXS was confirmed by clinical features and DNA testing. Intervention was initiated for both the siblings. Screening siblings in FXS is important. CDH can be associated with FXS.", "Many researchers have used the standard Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) to assess decision-making in adolescence given increased risk-taking during this developmental period. Most studies are cross-sectional and do not observe behavioral trajectories over time, limiting interpretation. This longitudinal study investigated healthy adolescents' and young adults' IGT performance across a 10-year span. A total of 189 individuals (aged 9-23 at baseline) completed a baseline session and were followed at 2-year intervals yielding 5 time-points. IGT deck contingencies were shuffled over time to reduce practice effects. IGT performance (good minus bad decisions) was measured at each assessment point and separated into 3 metrics: overall performance (all blocks), decision-making under ambiguity (blocks 1 and 2), and decision-making under risk (blocks 3, 4, and 5). Covariates included estimated intelligence and affective dispositions as measured by the Behavioral Inhibition and Activation System (BIS/BAS) Scales. A linear effect of age yielded the best fit when comparing linear and quadratic effects of age on overall IGT performance. Age and intelligence positively predicted overall performance, whereas affective approach tendencies (BAS) negatively predicted overall performance. Practice effects were observed and controlled for. Models of ambiguity and risk metrics yielded different patterns of significant predictors. Age predicted better performance and affective approach tendencies predicted worse performance for both metrics. Intelligence was a significant predictor for risk, but not ambiguity. This longitudinal study extends prior work by showing age-related improvements in reward-based decision-making and associating those improvements with cognitive and affective variables. Implications of the results for adolescent development are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record", "Capacity to receive, verify, analyze, assess, and investigate public health events is essential for epidemic intelligence. Public health Emergency Operations Centers (PHEOCs) can be epidemic intelligence hubs by 1) having the capacity to receive, analyze, and visualize multiple data streams, including surveillance and 2) maintaining a trained workforce that can analyze and interpret data from real-time emerging events. Such PHEOCs could be physically located within a ministry of health epidemiology, surveillance, or equivalent department rather than exist as a stand-alone space and serve as operational hubs during nonoutbreak times but in emergencies can scale up according to the traditional Incident Command System structure.", "The Boston Naming Test (BNT) is one of the most commonly used naming measures in neuropsychology. Although research in the older adult population has shown that African-American (AA) adults perform more poorly on the BNT than non-Hispanic White American (WA) adults, these findings have yet to be replicated in younger adults. The BNT and measures of word reading (WJ-Letter Word ID) and vocabulary (Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence Vocabulary) were administered to 50 WA and 33 AA young adults. Performance was age-normed based on published norms and transformed into z-scores. Despite being matched on age, gender, SES, and level of education, the AA group performed more poorly on the BNT (z\u2009=\u2009-\u20091.01(1.09)) than the WA group (z\u2009=\u2009-\u2009.28(.92)), t(104)\u2009=\u20093.44, p\u2009<\u2009.01, d\u2009=\u20090.73. AAs (18%) were more likely to perform in the impaired range than WAs (4%) when impairment cutoff was z-score\u2264\u2009-\u20092. Healthy AA young adults are more likely to perform poorly on the BNT despite vocabulary and word reading being well within normal limits. Average BNT performance in both groups were at least one z-score lower than average vocabulary z-scores. Clinicians should interpret poor scores on the BNT with caution, and within the context of individual vocabulary or word reading performance.", "Haptic memory, from the interaction of skin and brain, can not only perceive external stimuli but also memorize it after removing the external stimuli. For the mimicry of human sensory memory, a self-powered artificial tactile memorizing system was developed by coupling bionic electronic skin and nonvolatile resistive random access memory (RRAM). The tribotronic nanogenerator is utilized as electronic skin to transform the touching signal into electric pulse, which will be programmed into the artificial brain: RRAM. Because of the advanced structural designs and accurate parameter matching, including the output voltages and the resistances in different resistive states, the artificial brain can be operated in self-powered mode to memorize the touch stimuli with the responsivity up to 20 times. For demonstrating the application potential of this system, it was fabricated as an independently addressed matrix to realize the memorizing of motion trace in two-dimensional space. The newly designed self-powered nonvolatile system has broad applications in next-generation high-performance sensors, artificial intelligence, and bionics.", "A 54-year-old man was admitted to the intensive care unit with an aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage and subsequently underwent mechanical ventilation and received neuromuscular blocking drugs to control refractory elevated intracranial pressure. During quantitative EEG monitoring, an automated alert was triggered by the train of four peripheral nerve stimulation artifacts. Real-time feedback was made possible due to remote monitoring. This case illustrates how computerized, automated artificial intelligence algorithms can be used beyond typical seizure detection in the intensive care unit for remote monitoring to benefit patient care.", "The brain continuously maintains a current representation of its immediate surroundings. Perceptual representations are often updated when the world changes, e.g., when we notice an object move. However, we can also update representations internally, without incoming signals from the senses. In other words, we can run internal simulations of dynamic events. This ability is evident during mental object rotation. These uncontroversial observations lead to an obvious question that nevertheless remains to be answered: How does the brain control the speed of dynamic mental simulations? Is there a central rate controller or pacemaker module in the brain that can be temporarily coupled to sensory maps? We can refer to this as the common rate control theory. Alternatively, the primitive intelligence within each map could tune into the speed of recent changes and use this information to keep going after stimuli disappear. We can call this the separate rate control theory. Preliminary evidence from prediction motion experiments supports common rate control, although local predictive mechanisms may cover short gaps of <200ms. The putative rate controller might turn out to be the same thing as the velocity store described in smooth pursuit eye movement models and/or the pacemaker module proposed in the cognitive timing literature. Indirect neuroimaging evidence suggests rate control is a function of the core timing system in the dorsal striatum.", "The assessment of emotional factors, in addition to other psychosocial factors, has been recommended as a means of identifying individuals with chronic pain who may not respond to certain pain treatments. Systematic reviews of the evidence regarding the prediction of responsiveness to a treatment called the spinal cord stimulator (SCS) have yielded inconclusive results. Emotional intelligence is a term which refers to the ability to identify and manage emotions in oneself and others and has been shown to be inversely associated with emotional distress and acute pain. This study aims to investigate the relationship between emotional intelligence, chronic pain, and the more established psychosocial factors usually used for SCS evaluations by clinical psychologists in medical settings. A sample of 112 patients with chronic pain on an acute hospital waiting list for SCS procedures in a pain medicine service were recruited. Psychological measures were completed including: a novel measure of emotional intelligence; usual measures of emotional distress and catastrophizing; and a numerical rating scale designed to assess pain intensity, pain-related distress, and interference. As predicted, findings revealed significant associations between most of the measures analyzed and current pain intensity. When entered into a simultaneous regression analysis, emotional intelligence scores remained the only significant predictor of current pain intensity. There are potential clinical, ethical, and organizational implications of emotional intelligence processes partially predicting pain in patients on a waiting list for a medical procedure. These results may offer new insight, understanding, and evaluation targets for clinical psychologists in the field of pain management.", "Epidemiological studies have demonstrated that folate, iodine and iron intake during pregnancy impacts on foetal brain development and cognitive function. However, in human studies, the relationship with other dietary nutrients is less clear.\nThis systematic review aims to critically appraise the current literature and meta-analyses results from nutritional interventions during pregnancy that aimed to optimise infant and child cognitive outcomes.\nTen electronic databases were searched for articles published up to August 2017. The search was limited to articles published in English. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) testing the impact of any nutritional intervention (dietary counselling, education, nutrient supplementation, fortified foods and/or foods) during pregnancy on cognitive outcomes of children (<10 years old). Two independent reviewers assessed study eligibility and quality using the American Dietetic Association quality criteria checklist for primary research. Standardised mean differences were used for nine cognitive domains to measure effects for meta-analyses.\nA total of 34 RCTs were included (21 studies included children aged less than 35 months, 10 studies included children aged 36-60 months and 3 studies included children aged 61-119 months). The types of nutritional interventions included nutrient supplements, whole foods, fortified foods and nutrition education. The following nine cognition outcomes: attention, behaviour, crystallised intelligence, fluid intelligence, global cognition, memory, motor skills, visual processing, and problem solving were not significantly impacted by nutritional interventions, although 65% of studies conducted post-hoc data analyses and were likely to be underpowered. Although, long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA) supplementation was associated with a marginal increase in crystallised intelligence (Effect size (ES): 0.25; 95% confidence interval (95% CI): -0.04, 0.53), the effect was not statistically significant (p = 0.09), with significant study heterogeneity (p = 0.00).\nLCPUFA supplementation may be associated with an improvement in child crystallised intelligence, however further research is warranted. The remaining eight cognition domains were not significantly impacted by maternal nutritional interventions.", "Difficulties in emotion regulation influence the development of substance use disorder (SUD), its severity, course, treatment outcomes, and relapse. Impaired executive functions (EFs) are common in SUD populations and may relate to emotion dysregulation. The current study tested whether performance on three basic EF tasks ('working memory', 'inhibition', and 'task-switching') and/or inventory-based assessment of EF were related to difficulties in emotion regulation in females attending residential SUD therapeutic community treatment.\nCross-sectional design in which participants (N=50, all female) completed a questionnaire battery including the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS) and Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function - Adult Version (BRIEF-A) was used. Participants also completed neuropsychological assessment of EF including the Working Memory Index (WMI; Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale), and measures of inhibition and task-switching (Color-Word Interference Test; Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System).\nExecutive dysfunction, as assessed by the Global Executive Composite (GEC; BRIEF-A), and personality disorder indicators (Standardised Assessment of Personality - Abbreviated Scale; SAPAS) were positively correlated with DERS scores. Sequential hierarchical regression indicated that task-switching, GEC, and SAPAS scores statistically predicted DERS scores, while working memory and inhibition did not. Mediation analysis indicated that there was a significant indirect effect of GEC scores and task-switching performance on DERS scores, through SAPAS scores.\nImpairment of EF, particularly task-switching, is related to difficulties in emotion regulation in a female sample attending residential SUD treatment. Cognitive training interventions that improve task-switching performance may be beneficial in promoting effective emotion regulation and improved SUD treatment outcomes.", "This paper suggests a tentative proposal for nurse education that may go some way to remedying the 'crisis of care' described by Judge Francis and others. Any viable strategy to improve caring attitudes in nursing students must involve activities across the curriculum that foster self-awareness and empathy. It is suggested that the best way to do this is for all undergraduate nursing students to participate in regular, supervised group psychotherapy sessions as a mandated requirement for registration. This strategy would be helpful in at least two main ways. First, it would be enormously beneficial in terms of promoting emotional intelligence - a necessary requirement for providing ethical, person-centred care. Second, it would also serve as an excellent form of student support, which would likely improve student retention rates. This is because individuals with strong group support systems are less likely to become mentally or physically ill and are, therefore, more resilient. Finally, some possible objections to this proposal are considered.", "In April of 2014, the Turkish Ministry of Health held the First Annual Health Technology Assessment (HTA) Meeting in Antalya.\nThe objectives were to understand the perceptions of stakeholders regarding the current status of HTA and document their recommendations and strategies for promoting systematic use of HTA in Turkey.\nThe study was conducted using a qualitative written survey assessing current compliance with the fifteen HTA principles suggested by Drummond et al. (Key principles for the improved conduct of health technology assessments for resource allocation decision. Int J Technol Assess Health Care. 2008;24:244-258) and a qualitative method referred to as the Collective Intelligence Platform\u00ae.\nA total of 216 stakeholders representing academic, public, and the private health sector attended the annual meeting; 178 completed the survey and 183 participated in the Platform. Quantitative Results: Survey participants reported that, although Turkey does not currently fully comply with any of the fifteen HTA principles, there is some compliance with all of them. The overall average score for all fifteen principles was 3.04. Quantitivate Results: Participants recommended a more transparent, independent, and evidence-based policy decision-making system through better coordination of HTA activities, data aggregation, capacity development, and a national HTA core model and framework.\nPlatform participants described the current HTA environment as disjointed and lacking in resources and support from policy-making leaders. Despite the persisting challenges, awareness of the strengths and weaknesses of the current system combined with increasing interaction among Turkish stakeholders and the international HTA community can meaningfully contribute to the continued development and promotion of HTA in Turkey.", "White matter lesions have been described in patients with PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome (PHTS). How these lesions correlate with the neurocognitive features associated with PTEN mutations, such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) or developmental delay, has not been well established. We report nine patients with PTEN mutations and white matter changes on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), eight of whom were referred for reasons other than developmental delay or ASD. Their clinical presentations ranged from asymptomatic macrocephaly with normal development/intellect, to obsessive compulsive disorder, and debilitating neurological disease. To our knowledge, this report constitutes the first detailed description of PTEN-related white matter changes in adult patients and in children with normal development and intelligence. We present a detailed assessment of the neuropsychological phenotype of our patients and discuss the relationship between the wide array of neuropsychiatric features and observed white matter findings in the context of these individuals.", "Hundreds of millions of people play intellectually-demanding video games every day. What does individual performance on these games tell us about cognition? Here, we describe two studies that examine the potential link between intelligence and performance in one of the most popular video games genres in the world (Multiplayer Online Battle Arenas: MOBAs). In the first study, we show that performance in the popular MOBA League of Legends' correlates with fluid intelligence as measured under controlled laboratory conditions. In the second study, we also show that the age profile of performance in the two most widely-played MOBAs (League of Legends and DOTA II) matches that of raw fluid intelligence. We discuss and extend previous videogame literature on intelligence and videogames and suggest that commercial video games can be useful as 'proxy' tests of cognitive performance at a global population level.", "In countries with high prevalence of tuberculosis (TB), clinicians often diagnose tuberculous pleural effusion (TPE) by using diagnostic tests, which have not only poor sensitivity, but poor availability as well. The aim of our study is to develop a new artificial intelligence based diagnostic model that is accurate, fast, non-invasive and cost effective to diagnose TPE. It is expected that a tool derived based on the model be installed on simple computer devices (such as smart phones and tablets) and be used by clinicians widely.\nFor this study, data of 140 patients whose clinical signs, routine blood test results, blood biochemistry markers, pleural fluid cell type and count, and pleural fluid biochemical tests' results were prospectively collected into a database. An Artificial intelligence based diagnostic model, which employs moth flame optimization based support vector machine with feature selection (FS-MFO-SVM), is constructed to predict the diagnosis of TPE.\nThe optimal model results in an average of 95% accuracy (ACC), 0.9564 the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), 93.35% sensitivity, and 97.57% specificity for FS-MFO-SVM.\nThe proposed artificial intelligence based diagnostic model is found to be highly reliable for diagnosing TPE based on simple clinical signs, blood samples and pleural effusion samples. Therefore, the proposed model can be widely used in clinical practice and further evaluated for use as a substitute of invasive pleural biopsies.", "Cognitive reserve (CR) can be considered an active expression of brain resilience in response to a damage. Several studies have shown the influence of CR on cognitive impairment and its relationship with cognitive function in Parkinson's disease (PD).\nThe aim of the present study was to show if CR influences the effectiveness of balance rehabilitation in PD patients who performed a conventional rehabilitative treatment.\nObservational longitudinal study.\nNeurology Outpatient Unit, University Hospital.\nFifty-three patients affected by idiopathic PD, stage 2-3 at the Hoehn and Yahr Scale.\nEach patient underwent 32 group sessions of conventional rehabilitative treatment. At baseline, patients' CR was assessed by the Cognitive Reserve Index questionnaire (CRIq). The primary outcome was the evaluation of static and dynamic balance modifications, induced by the treatment, through the Berg Balance Scale (BBS), assessed at T0 and T1. Mini Mental State Examination, Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale Part III (clinician-scored monitored motor evaluation) and Brief Intelligence Test were assessed only at T0 and used as descriptive variables.\nConsidering the clinically meaningful change, BBS improved in 26% of patients, worsened in 2% and was unchanged in 72%. BBS score significantly improved in older patients, and in those with lower CRI total score. A significant inverse correlation was observed between changes in BBS and work and education related CR. Patients with lower baseline BBS score showed better improvement in balance.\nWe found an inverse correlation between CR level and balance improvement in PD patients who underwent conventional rehabilitation: higher improvement in BBS was observed in those with a lower CRI score. This may suggest that patients with higher CRI could benefit from more stimulating types of non-conventional rehabilitation (e.g. robotic, virtual reality).\nRehabilitation should be individually tailored considering CR as a significant variable.", "Imagination and creative cognition are often associated with the brain's default network (DN). Recent evidence has also linked cognitive control systems to performance on tasks involving imagination and creativity, with a growing number of studies reporting functional interactions between cognitive control and DN regions. We sought to extend the emerging literature on brain dynamics supporting imagination by examining individual differences in large-scale network connectivity in relation to Openness to Experience, a personality trait typified by imagination and creativity. To this end, we obtained personality and resting-state fMRI data from two large samples of participants recruited from the United States and China, and we examined contributions of Openness to temporal shifts in default and cognitive control network interactions using multivariate structural equation modeling and dynamic functional network connectivity analysis. In Study 1, we found that Openness was related to the proportion of scan time (i.e., \"dwell time\") that participants spent in a brain state characterized by positive correlations among the default, executive, salience, and dorsal attention networks. Study 2 replicated and extended the effect of Openness on dwell time in a correlated brain state comparable to the state found in Study 1, and further demonstrated the robustness of this effect in latent variable models including fluid intelligence and other major personality factors. The findings suggest that Openness to Experience is associated with increased functional connectivity between default and cognitive control systems, a connectivity profile that may account for the enhanced imaginative and creative abilities of people high in Openness to Experience.", "We review our work on a contrast-based computational model of surprise and its applications. The review is contextualized within related research from psychology, philosophy, and particularly artificial intelligence. Influenced by psychological theories of surprise, the model assumes that surprise-eliciting events initiate a series of cognitive processes that begin with the appraisal of the event as unexpected, continue with the interruption of ongoing activity and the focusing of attention on the unexpected event, and culminate in the analysis and evaluation of the event and the revision of beliefs. It is assumed that the intensity of surprise elicited by an event is a nonlinear function of the difference or contrast between the subjective probability of the event and that of the most probable alternative event (which is usually the expected event); and that the agent's behavior is partly controlled by actual and anticipated surprise. We describe applications of artificial agents that incorporate the proposed surprise model in three domains: the exploration of unknown environments, creativity, and intelligent transportation systems. These applications demonstrate the importance of surprise for decision making, active learning, creative reasoning, and selective attention.", "To explore the knowledge, attitudes and behaviors of parents whose children were diagnosed with epilepsy.\nCross-sectional questionnaire based study of parents who accompanied their children with epilepsy to the child neurology clinics at three university hospitals in Jordan.\nMost parents (427, 90.3%) knew that epilepsy is not related to a psychiatric disease. Approximately half of the parents (245, 51.8%) used the internet as their source of knowledge, and most used Arabic websites. Searching the word epilepsy was rarely used (51, 10.8%). Most of the parents (428,90.5%) were not restricting their children from watching TV or from using the computer (358,75.5%).However, many parents (280,59.2%) were restricting them from participating in sports. Parents had negative attitudes towards epilepsy; 189 (40.0%)thought that epileptic children can have normal intelligence, and 292 (61.7%) thought that they can continue into higher education. Greater parental knowledge of epilepsy was found to be correlated with the parental education level (p<0.05).Positive attitudes and behaviors towards epilepsy were found to be correlated with a higher parental education level, control of epilepsy,an absence of associated co morbidities, a higher income and internet use (p<0.05).\nThis study sheds an important light on the current knowledge status and attitudes of parents of children with epilepsy, and is an invaluable tool for tailoring the delivery of information and support resources for families in our region.", "To present research models based on artificial intelligence and discuss the concept of cognitive computing and eScience as disruptive factors in health and life science research methodologies.\nThe paper identifies big data as a catalyst to innovation and the development of artificial intelligence, presents a framework for computer-supported human problem solving and describes a transformation of research support models. This framework includes traditional computer support; federated cognition using machine learning and cognitive agents to augment human intelligence; and a semi-autonomous/autonomous cognitive model, based on deep machine learning, which supports eScience.\nThe paper provides a forward view of the impact of artificial intelligence on our human-computer support and research methods in health and life science research.\nBy augmenting or amplifying human task performance with artificial intelligence, cognitive computing and eScience research models are discussed as novel and innovative systems for developing more effective adaptive obesity intervention programs.", "This study evaluated whether maternal mood disorders (MMD), particularly bipolar disorder, and lithium treatment during pregnancy influenced the neonatal health and cognition of children born from 2006 to 2010.\nOur study at Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden, focused on women with and without mood disorders and their children. Information on pharmacotherapy, mental health, delivery and neonatal complications was retrospectively collected from electronic patient records. Children were tested in a blinded manner at four to five years of age with the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence, 3rd edition. Maternal health, child health and social situations were evaluated.\nOf the 39 children, 20 were exposed to lithium and MMD during pregnancy, eight were exposed to MMD but not lithium and 11 were not exposed to MMD or lithium. The children's full scale intelligence quotient (IQ), performance IQ and verbal IQ results did not differ significantly between the groups. The processing speed quotient was significantly lower in children exposed to mood disorders, but there was a high level of missing data for this subtest.\nThis small, clinical cohort showed no significant association between mothers' prenatal exposure to lithium or mood disorders and their offspring's IQ.", "The objective of this review is to map what is known about emotional intelligence (EI) in relation to staff job satisfaction and retention in nursing, and the tools that are used to measure EI in this context.\nThe primary question of this review is: What is known about nurse managers' EI as it relates to staff job satisfaction and retention in nursing?Sub-question 1: What tools are being used to measure nurse managers' EI and what theoretical frameworks are they based on?Sub-question 2: What gaps exist in the research related to nurse managers' EI as it relates to staff job satisfaction and retention in nursing?", "Resting-state electroencephalogram (rsEEG) has been found to be associated with psychopathology, intelligence, problem solving, academic performance and is sometimes used as a supportive physiological indicator of enhancement in cognitive training interventions (e.g. neurofeedback, working memory training). In the current study, we measured rsEEG spectral power measures (relative power, between-band ratios and asymmetry) in one hundred sixty five young adults who were also tested on a battery of executive function (EF). We specifically focused on upper Alpha, Theta and Beta frequency bands given their putative role in EF. Our indices enabled finding correlations since they had decent-to-excellent internal and retest reliability and very little range restriction relative to a nation-wide representative large sample. Nonetheless, Bayesian statistical inference indicated support for the null hypothesis concerning lack of monotonic correlation between EF and rsEEG spectral power measures. Therefore, we conclude that, contrary to the quite common interpretation, these rsEEG spectral power measures do not indicate individual differences in the measured EF abilities.", "Highly stretchable and durable conductors are significant to the development of wearable devices, robots, human-machine interfaces, and other artificial intelligence products. Although many respectable methods have been reported, it is still a challenge to fabricate stretchable conductors with a large elastic limit, high conductivity, and excellent reliability in rapid, effective, and economic ways. Herein, a facile method is offered to fabricate high-performance stretchable tubular conductors (TCs) based on a macroconfined structure of expanded graphite (EG) in rubber tubing by simply physical packing. The maximum original electrical conductivity of TCs reached a high value of 160.6 S/cm. Meanwhile, TCs showed more insensitive response of conductivity to increasing tensile strain compared to the TCs encapsulated with liquid metal or ionic liquid. The conductivity and effective stretchability of TCs can be adjusted by varying the packing density of EG. A low gauge factor below 3 was reached even under 400% stretching for TCs with a packing density of 1.233 g/cm3. The excellent resilience and good stability of conductivity of TCs during dynamic stretching-releasing cycles are attributed to the stable and rapid reconstruction of the percolation network of EG particles. The combination of high conductivity, tunable stretchability, and good reliability renders potential applications to TCs, such as highly stretchable interconnects or strain sensors, in human motion detection.", "The goal of this study was to investigate the relationship between fluid intelligence (gF) and the pattern of the functional characteristics in the resting state in adults using multivariate pattern analysis. Resting-state functional images from 100 participants in the Human Connectome Project data set were analyzed. The amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) was first calculated, and a support vector regression approach was used to identify the association with gF. To discover whether the connectivity of the gF-associated areas was also related to gF, we further checked the seed-based functional connectivity using the seeds from the ALFF. The ALFF showed that gF was correlated with the left anterior cingulate cortex, which is involved in high cognitive control processes. The functional connectivity showed that the connection between the right prefrontal cortex (Brodmann area 8) and the left anterior cingulate cortex could predict gF. The multivariate pattern analysis result indicated that the brain functional activity and functional integrity that we identified have the potential to become an objective biomarker for evaluating individual differences in gF.", "The human brain is a large, interacting dynamic network, and its architecture of coupling among brain regions varies across time (termed the \"chronnectome\"). However, very little is known about whether and how the dynamic properties of the chronnectome can characterize individual uniqueness, such as identifying individuals as a \"fingerprint\" of the brain. Here, we employed multiband resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data from the Human Connectome Project (N\u2009=\u2009105) and a sliding time-window dynamic network analysis approach to systematically examine individual time-varying properties of the chronnectome. We revealed stable and remarkable individual variability in three dynamic characteristics of brain connectivity (i.e., strength, stability, and variability), which was mainly distributed in three higher order cognitive systems (i.e., default mode, dorsal attention, and fronto-parietal) and in two primary systems (i.e., visual and sensorimotor). Intriguingly, the spatial patterns of these dynamic characteristics of brain connectivity could successfully identify individuals with high accuracy and could further significantly predict individual higher cognitive performance (e.g., fluid intelligence and executive function), which was primarily contributed by the higher order cognitive systems. Together, our findings highlight that the chronnectome captures inherent functional dynamics of individual brain networks and provides implications for individualized characterization of health and disease.", "This article identifies three relevant and valid constructs that are associated with personal and organisational performance that can be used in the training of current and future health service managers: personal engagement at work, emotional intelligence and conflict resolution. A review was undertaken of the literature in human resources management to identify key concepts that bind and strengthen the management of organisations. A curriculum content analysis was then performed of postgraduate health management courses in Australia to assess the extent of inclusion in these areas. Three concepts and practices of relevance to the human dimension of health management, namely personal engagement at work, emotional intelligence and conflict resolution, were found to: (1) have concept validity; (2) be associated with personal and organisational performance; and (3) be capable of being imparted by training. The analysis indicated that none of the competencies and/or skills identified has been given emphasis in postgraduate health management courses in Australia. Competence in the management of human relationships in health services has been given low priority in university postgraduate training in health management in Australia. The current situation poses challenges to all stakeholders of health services.", "Adolescence represents an important period during which considerable changes in the brain take place, including increases in integrity of white matter bundles, and increasing efficiency of the structural brain network. A more efficient structural brain network has been associated with higher intelligence. Whether development of structural network efficiency is related to intelligence, and if so to which extent genetic and environmental influences are implicated in their association, is not known. In a longitudinal study, we mapped FA-weighted efficiency of the structural brain network in 310 twins and their older siblings at an average age of 10, 13, and 18 years. Age-trajectories of global and local FA-weighted efficiency were related to intelligence. Contributions of genes and environment were estimated using structural equation modeling. Efficiency of brain networks changed in a non-linear fashion from childhood to early adulthood, increasing between 10 and 13 years, and leveling off between 13 and 18 years. Adolescents with higher intelligence had higher global and local network efficiency. The dependency of FA-weighted global efficiency on IQ increased during adolescence (rph =0.007 at age 10; 0.23 at age 18). Global efficiency was significantly heritable during adolescence (47% at age 18). The genetic correlation between intelligence and global and local efficiency increased with age; genes explained up to 87% of the observed correlation at age 18. In conclusion, the brain's structural network differentiates depending on IQ during adolescence, and is under increasing influence of genes that are also associated with intelligence as it develops from late childhood to adulthood.", "We report on a patient who showed neural reorganization between injured cingula and the brainstem cholinergic nuclei following cerebral concussion.\nThe main concern of the patient is memory impairment.\nCerebral concussion.\nWhen she visited our hospital at 2 years after onset, cognitive function was evaluated using 2 scales; the Wechsler Intelligence Scale, and the Seoul neuropsychological screening battery: total IQ 97, verbal immediate recall 5.70 percentile, visual immediate recall 30.75 percentile, verbal delayed recall 3.13 percentile, visual delayed recall 11.00 percentile, verbal recognition <0.01 percentile, and visual recognition 13.70 percentile. Conventional brain magnetic resonance imaging did not show any abnormality. On 2-year diffusion tensor tractography for the cingulum, both anterior cingula were discontinued over the genu of the corpus callosum. One neural fiber bundle originating from the middle portion of the left cingulum descended through the left subcortical white matter, and connected to the left pedunculopontine nucleus (Ch 5) in the midbrain and the left laterodorsal tegmental nucleus (Ch 6) in the upper pons.\nReorganization of cholinergic innervations between cholinergic nuclei in the basal forebrain and brainstem following injury of the anterior cingulum was demonstrated in a patient with cerebral concussion.", "Recent evidence indicates that young children's spontaneous focusing on numerosity (SFON) uniquely contributes to their early numerical abilities. This study complements previous findings by validating the relation between young children's SFON and their early numerical abilities in a developing country, namely Ecuador. We analysed 355 Ecuadorian 5- to 6-year-olds' SFON in relation to their early numerical abilities at the start of kindergarten, controlling for children's socio-demographic (socio-economic status, age) and general cognitive (working memory, intelligence) characteristics. Our results evidence the unique contribution of Ecuadorian kindergartners' SFON to their early numerical abilities, controlling for children's working memory, intelligence, socio-economic status, and age. Our findings support the validity of previous findings on the unique contribution of SFON to young children's early numerical abilities in developed countries for developing countries. Additionally, they raise timely questions for further theoretical and methodological studies on young children's numerical development worldwide, in developing and developed countries. Statement of contribution What is already known? SFON uniquely contributes to early numerical abilities. However, this is only documented in Finnish samples. Previously only limited control for domain-general cognitive and socio-demographic characteristics. What does the study add? SFON uniquely contributes to early numerical abilities in Ecuadorian 5- to 6-year-olds. This unique contribution remains after controlling for WM, IQ, SES, and age. Evidence for the universal nature of the association between SFON and early numerical ability.", "Machine learning (ML) is a branch of artificial intelligence that allows computers to learn from large complex datasets without being explicitly programmed. Although ML is already widely manifest in our daily lives in various forms, the considerable potential of ML has yet to find its way into mainstream medical research and day-to-day clinical care. The complex diagnostic and therapeutic modalities used in neurosurgery provide a vast amount of data that is ideally suited for ML models. This systematic review explores ML's potential to assist and improve neurosurgical care.\nA systematic literature search was performed in the PubMed and Embase databases to identify all potentially relevant studies up to January 1, 2017. All studies were included that evaluated ML models assisting neurosurgical treatment.\nOf the 6,402 citations identified, 221 studies were selected after subsequent title/abstract and full-text screening. In these studies, ML was used to assist surgical treatment of patients with epilepsy, brain tumors, spinal lesions, neurovascular pathology, Parkinson's disease, traumatic brain injury, and hydrocephalus. Across multiple paradigms, ML was found to be a valuable tool for presurgical planning, intraoperative guidance, neurophysiological monitoring, and neurosurgical outcome prediction.\nML has started to find applications aimed at improving neurosurgical care by increasing the efficiency and precision of perioperative decision-making. A thorough validation of specific ML models is essential before implementation in clinical neurosurgical care. To bridge the gap between research and clinical care, practical and ethical issues should be considered parallel to the development of these techniques.", "To identify developmental sub-groups of depressive symptoms during the second decade of life, a critical period of brain development, using data from a prospective birth cohort. To test whether childhood intelligence and inflammatory markers are associated with subsequent persistent depressive symptoms.\nIQ, a proxy for neurodevelopment, was measured at age 8 years. Interleukin 6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein, typical inflammatory markers, were measured at age 9 years. Depressive symptoms were measured six times between 10 and 19 years using the short mood and feelings questionnaire (SMFQ), which were coded as binary variable and then used in latent class analysis to identify developmental sub-groups of depressive symptoms.\nLongitudinal SMFQ data from 9156 participants yielded three distinct population sub-groups of depressive symptoms: no symptoms (81.2%); adolescent-onset symptoms (13.2%); persistent symptoms (5.6%). Lower IQ and higher IL-6 levels in childhood were independently associated with subsequent persistent depressive symptoms in a linear, dose-response fashion, but not with adolescent-onset symptoms. Compared with the group with no symptoms the adjusted odds ratio for persistent depressive symptoms per s.d. increase in IQ was 0.80 (95% CI, 0.68-0.95); that for IL-6 was 1.20 (95% CI, 1.03-1.39). Evidence for an association with IL-6 remained after controlling for initial severity of depressive symptoms at 10 years. There was no evidence that IL-6 moderated or mediated the IQ-persistent depressive symptom relationship.\nThe results indicate potentially important roles for two distinct biological processes, neurodevelopment and inflammation, in the aetiology of persistent depressive symptoms in young people.", "There is a long history of considering the constituent components of malaria risk and the malaria transmission cycle via the use of mathematical models, yet strategic planning in endemic countries tends not to take full advantage of available disease intelligence to tailor interventions. National malaria programmes typically make operational decisions about where to implement vector control and surveillance activities based upon simple categorizations of annual parasite incidence. With technological advances, an enormous opportunity exists to better target specific malaria interventions to the places where they will have greatest impact by mapping and evaluating metrics related to a variety of risk components, each of which describes a different facet of the transmission cycle. Here, these components and their implications for operational decision-making are reviewed. For each component, related mappable malaria metrics are also described which may be measured and evaluated by malaria programmes seeking to better understand the determinants of malaria risk. Implementing tailored programmes based on knowledge of the heterogeneous distribution of the drivers of malaria transmission rather than only consideration of traditional metrics such as case incidence has the potential to result in substantial improvements in decision-making. As programmes improve their ability to prioritize their available tools to the places where evidence suggests they will be most effective, elimination aspirations may become increasingly feasible.", "Coral reef ecosystems are declining worldwide and under foreseeable threat due to climate change, resulting in significant changes in reef communities. It is unknown, however, how such community changes impact interspecific interactions. Recent extreme weather events affecting the Great Barrier Reef, that is, consecutive cyclones and the 2016 El Ni\u00f1o event, allowed us to explore potential consequences in the mutualistic interactions involving cleaner fish Labroides dimidiatus (hereafter \"cleaner\"). After the perturbations, cleaner densities were reduced by 80%, disproportionally compared to the variety of reef fish clients from which cleaners remove ectoparasites. Consequently, shifts in supply and demand yielded an increase in the clients' demand for cleaning. Therefore, clients became less selective toward cleaners, whereas cleaners were able to choose from a multitude of partners. In parallel, we found a significant decline in the ability of cleaners to manage their reputation and to learn to prioritize ephemeral food sources to maximize food intake in laboratory experiments. In other words, cleaners failed to display the previously documented strategic sophistication that made this species a prime example for fish intelligence. In conclusion, low population densities may cause various effects on individual behavior, and as a consequence, interspecific interactions. At the same time, our data suggest that a recovery of population densities would cause a recovery of previously described interaction patterns and cleaner strategic sophistication within the lifetime of individuals.", "A large group with a special structure can become the mother of emergence. We discuss this hypothesis in relation to large-scale boid simulations and web data. In the boid swarm simulations, the nucleation, organization and collapse dynamics were found to be more diverse in larger flocks than in smaller flocks. In the second analysis, large web data, consisting of shared photos with descriptive tags, tended to group together users with similar tendencies, allowing the network to develop a core-periphery structure. We show that the generation rate of novel tags and their usage frequencies are high in the higher-order cliques. In this case, novelty is not considered to arise randomly; rather, it is generated as a result of a large and structured network. We contextualize these results in terms of adjacent possible theory and as a new way to understand collective intelligence. We argue that excessive information and material flow can become a source of innovation.This article is part of the themed issue 'Reconceptualizing the origins of life'.", "Intravitreal injections with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) medications have become the standard of care for their respective indications. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans of the central retina provide detailed anatomical data and are widely used by clinicians in the decision-making process of anti-VEGF indication. In recent years, significant progress has been made in artificial intelligence and computer vision research. We trained a deep convolutional artificial neural network to predict treatment indication based on central retinal OCT scans without human intervention.\nA total of 183,402 retinal OCT B-scans acquired between 2008 and 2016 were exported from the institutional image archive of a university hospital. OCT images were cross-referenced with the electronic institutional intravitreal injection records. OCT images with a following intravitreal injection during the first 21\u00a0days after image acquisition were assigned into the 'injection' group, while the same amount of random OCT images without intravitreal injections was labeled as 'no injection'. After image preprocessing, OCT images were split in a 9:1 ratio to training and test datasets. We trained a GoogLeNet inception deep convolutional neural network and assessed its performance on the validation dataset. We calculated prediction accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and receiver operating characteristics.\nThe deep convolutional neural network was successfully trained on the extracted clinical data. The trained neural network classifier reached a prediction accuracy of 95.5% on the images in the validation dataset. For single retinal B-scans in the validation dataset, a sensitivity of 90.1% and a specificity of 96.2% were achieved. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.968 on a per B-scan image basis, and 0.988 by averaging over six B-scans per examination on the validation dataset.\nDeep artificial neural networks show impressive performance on classification of retinal OCT scans. After training on historical clinical data, machine learning methods can offer the clinician support in the decision-making process. Care should be taken not to mistake neural network output as treatment recommendation and to ensure a final thorough evaluation by the treating physician.", "Machiavellianism - a personality trait that is characterized by a tendency to distrust, deceive and exploit others - has been the focus of growing attention in psychological research. Neuroimaging studies of Machiavellianism highlight the influence of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) on Machiavellianism tendencies. However, knowledge regarding the causal role of the left and right dlPFC on Machiavellianism is still obscure. Here, we measured general Machiavellian tendencies, as well as two subscales (i.e., Machiavellian Views and Machiavellian Tactics) in a large sample of brain-injured patients (N = 129) and non-brain-injured control participants (N = 37) to determine whether Machiavellianism tendencies can be altered by brain damage. We analyzed Machiavellianism tendencies as a function of lesion location, with patients separated into four groups based on dlPFC damage: left dlPFC damage, right dlPFC damage, non-dlPFC damage, and healthy controls. We found that left dlPFC damage increased Machiavellianism in general, and Machiavellian perspective (views) in particular, but did not modulate behavior (tactics). Critically, left dlPFC damage predicted higher levels of Machiavellianism after controlling for general and emotional intelligence, linguistic abilities, empathy and psychopathology. These findings establish a causal role of the left dlPFC in modulating Machiavellian views, and indicate that one can hold Machiavellian views without necessarily endorsing Machiavellian tactics.", "Does Day-3 cleavage-stage PGS affect neurodevelopment of 9-year-old IVF offspring?\nWe did not find evidence of adverse consequences of Day-3 cleavage-stage PGS on neurodevelopment of 9-year-old IVF offspring, although children born after IVF with or without PGS often had a non-optimal neurological condition.\nKnowledge on long-term sequelae for development and health of children born following PGS is lacking. This is striking as evidence accumulates that IVF itself is associated with increased risk for impaired health and development in the offspring.\nThis prospective, assessor-blinded, multicentre, follow-up study evaluated development and health of 9-year-old IVF children born to women who were randomly assigned to IVF with PGS (PGS group) or without PGS (control group). The follow-up examination at 9 years took place between March 2014 and May 2016.\nIn total, 408 women were included and randomly assigned to IVF with or without Day-3 cleavage-stage PGS. This resulted in 52 ongoing pregnancies in the PGS group and 74 in the control group. In the PGS group, 59 children were born alive; in the control group, 85 children were born alive. At the age of 9 years, 43 children born after PGS and 56 control children participated in the study. Our primary outcome was the neurological optimality score, a sensitive measure of neurological condition assessed with a standardized, age-specific test (Touwen test). Secondary outcomes were adverse neurological condition (neurologically abnormal and the complex form of minor neurological dysfunction), cognitive development (intelligence quotient and specific domains), behaviour (parental and teacher's questionnaires), blood pressure and anthropometrics.\nNeurodevelopmental outcome of PGS children did not differ from that of controls; the neurological optimality scores (mean values [(95% CI]: PGS children 51.5 [49.3; 53.7], control children 53.1 [50.5; 55.7]) were not significantly different. The prevalences of adverse neurological outcome (in all but one child implying the presence of the complex form of minor neurological dysfunction) did not differ between the groups (PGS group 17/43 [40%], control group 19/56 [34%]), although the prevalence of complex minor neurological dysfunction in both groups was rather high. Also intelligence quotient scores of the two groups were not significantly different (PGS group 114 [108; 120]); control group 117 [109; 125]), and the behaviour, blood pressure and anthropometrics of both groups did not differ. Mean blood pressures of both groups were above the 60th percentile.\nThe power analysis of the study was not based on the number of children needed for the follow-up study, but on the number of women who were needed to detect an increase in ongoing pregnancy rates after PGS. In addition, our study evaluated embryo biopsy in the form of PGS at cleavage stage (Day-3 embryo biopsy), while currently PGS at blastocyst stage (Day-5 embryo biopsy) is recommended and increasingly being used.\nOur findings indicate that PGS in cleavage stage embryos is not associated with adverse effects on neurological, cognitive and behavioural development, blood pressure and anthropometrics of offspring at 9 years. This is a reassuring finding as embryo biopsy in the forms of PGS and PGD is increasingly applied. However, both groups of IVF offspring showed high prevalences of the clinically relevant form of minor neurological dysfunction, which is a point of concern for the IVF community. In addition, our study confirms findings of others that IVF offspring may be at risk of an unfavourable cardiovascular outcome. These findings are alarming and highlight the importance of research on the underlying mechanisms of unfavourable neurodevelopmental and cardiovascular outcomes in IVF offspring.\nThe randomized controlled trial was financially supported by the Organization for Health Research and Development (ZonMw), The Netherlands (Grant number 945-03-013). The follow-up was financially supported by the University Medical Center Groningen (Grant number: 754510), the Cornelia Foundation, and the graduate schools BCN and Share, Groningen, The Netherlands. The sponsors of the study had no role in study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation or writing of the report. There are no conflicts of interest.\nISRCTN76355836.", "Group-based psychosocial therapy, such as group Cognitive Stimulation Therapy, improves cognition and quality of life in people living with dementia. Neuropsychiatric symptoms and restricted mobility are common complications for people with Parkinson's-related dementia (PRD) and may limit access to, and participation in, group activities. This study describes the development of a condition-specific, home-based psychosocial therapy for people with PRD ready to be trialled in a clinical population.\nBy means of a multistage process, a draft therapy manual was developed in an iterative manner through collaboration with medical experts, researchers and Patient and Public Involvement (PPI) representatives. In stage 1, an extensive literature search of psychosocial therapies for dementia with potential relevance for Parkinson's disease (PD) was undertaken to select a candidate therapy for adaptation. In stage 2, qualitative feedback from stakeholders and intelligence regarding existing nonpharmacological therapies for cognitive impairment in PD was combined to produce a prototype therapy manual. In stage 3, the manual was field tested in: 1) a home-setting using a 25-item assessment tool; and 2) at a local PD support group with PPI representatives. Based on the feedback from this phase, final design modifications were implemented and a draft therapy manual produced.\nThe manual was developed in an iterative manner. Interview and focus group transcripts identified three enduring themes: manual form and content, therapy acceptability by people with PRD, and companion guidance and support. Major adaptations included: removal of discrete levels of task complexity, removal of images that were potentially hallucinogenic or lacked clarity, and updating of the content.\nWe have successfully developed a Cognitive Stimulation Therapy-based psychosocial therapy specifically adapted for people with PRD. The therapy is ready to trial in a pilot randomized controlled study.", "To study the cognitive functions and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in individuals taking a combination of tamsulosin and solifenacin in a higher dosage.\nAll patients (n\u2009=\u2009262) were assigned to group A (N\u2009=\u200993, tamsulosin 0.4\u2009mg\u2009+\u2009solifenacin 10\u2009mg per day), group B (N\u2009=\u200983, tamsulosin 0.4\u2009mg\u2009+\u2009solifenacin 20\u2009mg), and control group C (N\u2009=\u200986; tamsulosin 0.4\u2009mg\u2009+\u2009placebo). The lower urinary tract (LUT) condition was assessed on the scales International Prostate Symptom Score, Over Active Bladder Awareness Tool and uroflowmetry. The state of cognitive status was assessed on the scales Mini-mental State Examination, Controlled Oral Word Association Test, Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised, Wechsler III, Color Trails Test, California Verbal Learning Test.\nThe values of cognitive function indicators in the individuals from all groups after treatment did not significantly differ from the respective values at the baseline (p\u2009>\u2009.05). The values of most HRQoL parameters of the functional state of the LUT significantly improved in groups A and B. A significant correlation between the state of cognitive status and HRQoL, as well as LUT was absent (r\u2009<0.3).\nThe combination of solifenacin in a double dosage along with tamsulosin can be recommended for elderly benign prostatic hyperplasia patients with overactive bladder symptoms.", "While short-term memory (STM) and working memory (WM) are understood as being crucial for learning, and children with epilepsy often experience learning difficulties, little is known about the age-related development of memory span tasks in children with epilepsy. Short-term memory and WM, operationalized as digit span forwards (DSF) or digit span backwards (DSB), respectively, were studied. Participants were 314 children with epilepsy and 327 typically developing children in ages between 5 and 15years and full scale intelligence quotient (FS-IQ)\u226575. Cross-sectional analyses of the data were done with analyses of variance and analyses of covariance ((M)ANCOVAs) and generalized linear analyses. The analyses revealed that STM problems in epilepsy were mediated by age-related gains in WM as well as by differences in IQ. Working memory developed at a quick pace in the younger children, the pace slowed down to some extent in the later primary school years and resumed again later on. Working memory problems prevailed in epilepsy, independent of IQ and development of STM. Timing of the epilepsy in terms of age at onset and duration determined memory development. The youngest children with epilepsy showed age-appropriate development in STM but were the most vulnerable in terms of WM development. Later in the course of the epilepsy, the WM problems of the young children attenuated. In later onset epilepsy, WM problems were smaller but persisted over time.", "Amidst the continual march of technology, we find ourselves relying on digital videos to proffer visual evidence in several highly sensitive areas such as journalism, politics, civil and criminal litigation, and military and intelligence operations. However, despite being an indispensable source of information with high evidentiary value, digital videos are also extremely vulnerable to conscious manipulations. Therefore, in a situation where dependence on video evidence is unavoidable, it becomes crucial to authenticate the contents of this evidence before accepting them as an accurate depiction of reality. Digital videos can suffer from several kinds of manipulations, but perhaps, one of the most consequential forgeries is copy-paste forgery, which involves insertion/removal of objects into/from video frames. Copy-paste forgeries alter the information presented by the video scene, which has a direct effect on our basic understanding of what that scene represents, and so, from a forensic standpoint, the challenge of detecting such forgeries is especially significant. In this paper, we propose a sensor pattern noise based copy-paste detection scheme, which is an improved and forensically stronger version of an existing noise-residue based technique. We also study a demosaicing artifact based image forensic scheme to estimate the extent of its viability in the domain of video forensics. Furthermore, we suggest a simplistic clustering technique for the detection of copy-paste forgeries, and determine if it possess the capabilities desired of a viable and efficacious video forensic scheme. Finally, we validate these schemes on a set of realistically tampered MJPEG, MPEG-2, MPEG-4, and H.264/AVC encoded videos in a diverse experimental set-up by varying the strength of post-production re-compressions and transcodings, bitrates, and sizes of the tampered regions. Such an experimental set-up is representative of a neutral testing platform and simulates a real-world forgery scenario where the forensic investigator has no control over any of the variable parameters of the tampering process. When tested in such an experimental set-up, the four forensic schemes achieved varying levels of detection accuracies and exhibited different scopes of applicabilities. For videos compressed using QFs in the range 70-100, the existing noise residue based technique generated average detection accuracy in the range 64.5%-82.0%, while the proposed sensor pattern noise based scheme generated average accuracy in the range 89.9%-98.7%. For the aforementioned range of QFs, average accuracy rates achieved by the suggested clustering technique and the demosaicing artifact based approach were in the range 79.1%-90.1% and 83.2%-93.3%, respectively.", "Having a substance use disorder (SUD) may adversely affect caregiving capacities. Reflective functioning (RF) and executive functioning (EF) are both important capacities for sensitive parenting, and are often impaired in a SUD. Only a few studies have explored the possible association between the two phenomena. In this study, we used a neuropsychological test battery to assess EF, and the Parent Development Interview to assess RF in a sample of mothers with a SUD (N\u00a0=\u00a043). Although parental RF (PRF) was associated with EF, when controlled for intelligence (IQ) and mental health, there was no significant association between EF and PRF. Mental health, however, showed a significant negative association with PRF. Splitting the group in two based on PRF level, mothers with a negative to low PRF exhibited more severe difficulties in SUD-related aspects, as well as in several EF components, compared to mothers with an adequate to high PRF, highlighting the association between EF and PRF. The results from this study contribute to enhance our understanding of the dynamics underlying vulnerability in PRF that mothers with small children may experience. We suggest EF to be a prerequisite for adequate PRF, and for interventions to be customized accordingly regarding parents with a SUD.", "In older adults, selenium status has been positively associated with cognitive function. We recently reported a positive association between maternal selenium status in pregnancy and children's cognitive function at 1.5 y.\nWe followed up the children to assess if prenatal and childhood selenium status was associated with cognitive abilities at 5 and 10 y.\nThis longitudinal cohort study was nested in Maternal and Infant Nutrition Interventions in Matlab (MINIMat), a population-based, randomized supplementation trial in pregnancy in rural Bangladesh. Selenium in maternal blood [erythrocyte fraction (Ery-Se) at baseline] and in child hair and urine was measured using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Children's cognition at 5 and 10 y was assessed using the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence\u2122 and the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children\u00ae, respectively. In total, 1,408 children were included.\nMultivariable-adjusted linear regression analyses showed that prenatal selenium status was positively associated with children's cognitive function at 5 and 10 y. An increase in maternal Ery-Se from the fifth to the 95th percentile [median: 0.44\u03bcg/g hemoglobin (Hb)] was associated with an increase in full developmental score of 3.5 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.1, 7.0], corresponding to 0.16 standard deviation (SD) at 5 y, and 8.1 (95% CI: 3.8, 13), corresponding to 0.24 SD at 10 y. In addition, urine and hair selenium concentrations at 5 and 10 y of age were positively associated with cognitive function at 10 y, although associations were inverse for concentrations \u226598th\u2009percentile. Some associations were slightly stronger for girls than for boys.\nMeasures of prenatal and childhood (below the 98th percentile) selenium status were associated with higher cognitive function scores at 5 and 10 y of age. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP1691.", "This longitudinal study examined differences in the development of working memory (WM) between children with specific language impairment (SLI) and typically developing (TD) children. Further, it explored to what extent language at ages 7-8 years could be predicted by measures of language and/or WM at ages 4-5 years.\nThirty children with SLI and 33 TD children who were previously examined on measures of WM and language at ages 4-5 years (T1) were reexamined at ages 7-8 years (T2).\nThe developmental course of WM was mostly similar for the two groups; only the development of the verbal storage component differed. At T1, children with SLI performed significantly below their TD peers on all components of WM (verbal storage, verbal central executive [CE], visuospatial storage, and visuospatial CE), whereas at T2, the differences for the visuospatial components were no longer significant when age and intelligence were taken into account. Hierarchical regression showed language and verbal CE at T1 to be significant predictors of language at T2, with no differences in the developmental associations between language and WM for the two groups.\nThe results of this study suggest that particularly verbal CE is of importance for the acquisition of linguistic skills.", "Academic performance in youth, measured by grade point average (GPA), predicts suicide attempt, but the mechanisms are not known. It has been suggested that general intelligence might underlie the association.\nWe followed 26 315 Swedish girls and boys in population-representative cohorts, up to maximum 46 years of age, for the first suicide attempt in hospital records. Associations between GPA at age 16, IQ measured in school at age 13 and suicide attempt were investigated in Cox regressions and mediation analyses.\nThere was a clear graded association between lower GPA and subsequent suicide attempt. With control for potential confounders, those in the lowest GPA quartile had a near five-fold risk (HR 4.9, 95% CI 3.7-6.7) compared to those in the highest quartile. In a mediation analysis, the association between GPA and suicide attempt was robust, while the association between IQ and suicide attempt was fully mediated by GPA.\nPoor academic performance in compulsory school, at age 16, was a robust predictor of suicide attempt past young adulthood and seemed to account for the association between lower childhood IQ and suicide attempt.", "Cooperation is a fundamental human ability that seems to be inversely related to aggressive behaviour in typical development. However, there is no knowledge whether similar association holds for children with autism spectrum disorder. A total of 27 boys with autism spectrum disorder and their gender, age and total score intelligence matched controls were studied in order to determine associations between cooperation, reactive aggression and autism spectrum disorder-related social impairments. The participants performed a modified version of the Prisoner's Dilemma task and the Pulkkinen Aggression Machine which measure dimensions of trust, trustworthiness and self-sacrifice in predisposition to cooperate, and inhibition of reactive aggression in the absence and presence of situational cues, respectively. Autism spectrum disorder severity-related Autism Diagnostic Interview-algorithm scores were ascertained by interviewing the parents of the participants with a semi-structured parental interview (Developmental, Dimensional and Diagnostic Interview). The results showed that albeit the boys with autism spectrum disorder were able to engage in reciprocation and cooperation regardless of their social impairments, their cooperativeness was positively associated with lower levels of reactive aggression and older age. Thus, strengthening inhibition mechanisms that regulate reactive aggression might make boys with autism spectrum disorder more likely to prefer mutual gain over self-interest in cooperation.", "Short-term storage and mental information manipulation capacities in the human brain are key to healthy cognition. These brain processes collectively known as working memory (WM) are associated with modulations of rhythmic brain activity across multiple brain areas and frequencies. Yet, it is not clear whether - and, if so, how-intrinsic resting-state neuronal oscillations are related to individual WM capacities, as measured by standard neuropsychological tests. We addressed this question by probing the correlation between resting-state brain activity, recorded with magnetoencephalography (MEG), and verbal and visuo-spatial WM indices obtained from the standardized Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS-IV) and the Wechsler Memory Scale (WMS-IV). To this end, 5-min eyes-open resting-state MEG data were acquired in 28 healthy participants. Source-reconstructed spectral power estimates were then computed in standard frequency bands and their correlation with neuropsychological indices across individuals was assessed using Pearson correlation and cluster-level statistics. We found statistically significant positive correlations between spectral amplitudes measured at rest and standardized scores on both verbal and visuo-spatial WM performance. The correlation clusters primarily involved key medial and dorsolateral components within the parietal and prefrontal regions. In addition, while the correlation in some clusters was frequency selective (e.g., alpha-band oscillations), other areas showed correlations with WM across a wide range of frequencies reflecting a broadband effect. These results provide the first evidence for a positive correlation between neuromagnetic signals measured at rest and WM performance separately assessed by standardized neuropsychological tests. Our results advance our understanding of the link between WM capacities and intrinsic oscillatory dynamics networks. They also suggest that individual differences in baseline spectral power might need to be taken into account when probing differences in brain responses during the execution of WM tasks.", "A molecular robot is a next-generation biochemical machine that imitates the actions of microorganisms. It is made of biomaterials such as DNA, proteins, and lipids. Three prerequisites have been proposed for the construction of such a robot: sensors, intelligence, and actuators. This Minireview focuses on recent research on synthetic ion channels and DNA computing technologies, which are viewed as potential candidate components of molecular robots. Synthetic ion channels, which are embedded in artificial cell membranes (lipid bilayers), sense ambient ions or chemicals and import them. These artificial sensors are useful components for molecular robots with bodies consisting of a lipid bilayer because they enable the interface between the inside and outside of the molecular robot to function as gates. After the signal molecules arrive inside the molecular robot, they can operate DNA logic gates, which perform computations. These functions will be integrated into the intelligence and sensor sections of molecular robots. Soon, these molecular machines will be able to be assembled to operate as a mass microrobot and play an active role in environmental monitoring and in\u2005vivo diagnosis or therapy.", "Tests of visuospatial function are often administered in comprehensive neuropsychological evaluations. These tests are generally considered assays of parietal lobe function; however, the neural correlates of these tests, using modern imaging techniques, are not well understood. In the current study we investigated the relationship between three commonly used tests of visuospatial function and lobar cortical thickness in each hemisphere.\nData from 374 patients who underwent a neuropsychological evaluation and MRI scans in an outpatient dementia clinic were included in the analysis. We examined the relationships between cortical thickness, as assessed with Freesurfer, and performance on three tests: Judgment of Line Orientation (JoLO), Block Design (BD) from the Fourth edition of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, and Brief Visuospatial Memory Test-Revised Copy Trial (BVMT-R-C) in patients who showed overall average performance on these tasks. Using a series of multiple regression models, we assessed which lobe's overall cortical thickness best predicted test performance.\nAmong the individual lobes, JoLO performance was best predicted by cortical thickness in the right temporal lobe. BD performance was best predicted by cortical thickness in the right parietal lobe, and BVMT-R-C performance was best predicted by cortical thickness in the left parietal lobe.\nPerformance on constructional tests of visuospatial function appears to correspond best with underlying cortical thickness of the parietal lobes, while performance on visuospatial judgment tests appears to correspond best to temporal lobe thickness. Future research using voxel-wise and connectivity techniques and including more diverse samples will help further understanding of the regions and networks involved in visuospatial tests.", "Connectome-based predictive modeling (CPM; Finn et\u00a0al., 2015; Shen et\u00a0al., 2017) was recently developed to predict individual differences in traits and behaviors, including fluid intelligence (Finn et\u00a0al., 2015) and sustained attention (Rosenberg et\u00a0al., 2016a), from functional brain connectivity (FC) measured with fMRI. Here, using the CPM framework, we compared the predictive power of three different measures of FC (Pearson's correlation, accordance, and discordance) and two different prediction algorithms (linear and partial least square [PLS] regression) for attention function. Accordance and discordance are recently proposed FC measures that respectively track in-phase synchronization and out-of-phase anti-correlation (Meskaldji et\u00a0al., 2015). We defined connectome-based models using task-based or resting-state FC data, and tested the effects of (1) functional connectivity measure and (2) feature-selection/prediction algorithm on individualized attention predictions. Models were internally validated in a training dataset using leave-one-subject-out cross-validation, and externally validated with three independent datasets. The training dataset included fMRI data collected while participants performed a sustained attention task and rested (N\u00a0=\u00a025; Rosenberg et\u00a0al., 2016a). The validation datasets included: 1) data collected during performance of a stop-signal task and at rest (N\u00a0=\u00a083, including 19 participants who were administered methylphenidate prior to scanning; Farr et\u00a0al., 2014a; Rosenberg et\u00a0al., 2016b), 2) data collected during Attention Network Task performance and rest (N\u00a0=\u00a041, Rosenberg et\u00a0al., in press), and 3) resting-state data and ADHD symptom severity from the ADHD-200 Consortium (N\u00a0=\u00a0113; Rosenberg et\u00a0al., 2016a). Models defined using all combinations of functional connectivity measure (Pearson's correlation, accordance, and discordance) and prediction algorithm (linear and PLS regression) predicted attentional abilities, with correlations between predicted and observed measures of attention as high as 0.9 for internal validation, and 0.6 for external validation (all p's\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Models trained on task data outperformed models trained on rest data. Pearson's correlation and accordance features generally showed a small numerical advantage over discordance features, while PLS regression models were usually better than linear regression models. Overall, in addition to correlation features combined with linear models (Rosenberg et\u00a0al., 2016a), it is useful to consider accordance features and PLS regression for CPM.", "Artificial intelligence and brain-computer interfaces must respect and preserve people\u2019s privacy, identity, agency and equality, say Rafael Yuste, Sara Goering and colleagues.", "The sequencing by hybridization (SBH) of determining the order in which nucleotides should occur on a DNA string is still under discussion for enhancements on computational intelligence although the next generation of DNA sequencing has come into existence. In the last decade, many works related to graph theory-based DNA sequencing have been carried out in the literature. This paper proposes a method for SBH by integrating hypergraph with genetic algorithm (HGGA) for designing a novel analytic technique to obtain DNA sequence from its spectrum. The paper represents elements of the spectrum and its relation as hypergraph and applies the unimodular property to ensure the compatibility of relations between l-mers. The hypergraph representation and unimodular property are bound with the genetic algorithm that has been customized with a novel selection and crossover operator reducing the computational complexity with accelerated convergence. Subsequently, upon determining the primary strand, an anti-homomorphism is invoked to find the reverse complement of the sequence. The proposed algorithm is implemented in the GenBank BioServer datasets, and the results are found to prove the efficiency of the algorithm. The HGGA is a non-classical algorithm with significant advantages and computationally attractive complexity reductions ranging to [Formula: see text] with improved accuracy that makes it prominent for applications other than DNA sequencing like image processing, task scheduling and big data processing.", "Advances in domains such as sensor networks and electronic and ambient intelligence have allowed us to create intelligent environments (IEs). However, research in IE is being held back by the fact that researchers face major difficulties, such as a lack of resources for their experiments. Indeed, they cannot easily build IEs to evaluate their approaches. This is mainly because of economic and logistical issues. In this paper, we propose a simulator to build virtual IEs. Simulators are a good alternative to physical IEs because they are inexpensive, and experiments can be conducted easily. Our simulator is open source and it provides users with a set of virtual sensors that simulates the behavior of real sensors. This simulator gives the user the capacity to build their own environment, providing a model to edit inhabitants' behavior and an interactive mode. In this mode, the user can directly act upon IE objects. This simulator gathers data generated by the interactions in order to produce datasets. These datasets can be used by scientists to evaluate several approaches in IEs.", "To assess the effect of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) on cognitive performance (CP) in patients with prostate cancer (PCa) after 6 months of treatment with luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) analogues.\nProspective, observational, multicentre, open-label study of patients diagnosed with nonmetastatic or asymptomatic metastatic PCa scheduled to receive LHRH analogues for\u22656 months. We assessed four CP domains at baseline and after 6 months of ADT: 1) Working memory: Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale III (WAIS III) Digit Span Subtest (WAIS III-Digit); 2) Visual memory: ad hoc visual memory test; 3) Visuospatial ability: Judgement of Line Orientation (JLO) and Mental Rotation of Three-Dimensional Objects (3D-Rotation); and 4) Nonverbal analytical reasoning: WAIS III Matrix Reasoning Test (WAIS III-MRT). Changes outside the baseline 95% confidence intervals were considered significant.\nA total of 308 patients completed the study. Of these, 245 (79.6%) experienced no statistically significant changes on any test and 63 patients (20.4%) experienced significant changes in \u22651 test. Of these, most presented a change in only one test, distributed evenly between improvements (58 patients; 18.8%) and worsening (56 patients; 18.2%). For individual tests, most patients (87.8% to 91.8%) had no change from baseline; however, the significant changes (improvement vs. deterioration, respectively) were as follows: WAIS III-Digit (6.3% vs. 5.9%); visual memory (5.3% vs. 5.7%); JLO (5.3% vs. 4.5%); 3D-Rotation (4.1% vs. 4.1%); and WAIS III-MRT (4.8% vs. 5.8%).\nCP in patients with PCa does not appear to be adversely affected by 6 months of LHRH analogue administration.", "During the second quarter of 2017, Cortellis Competitive Intelligence added 967 new licensing deals (excluding mergers and acquisition deals) as part of its ongoing coverage of pharmaceutical licensing activity. This meant an 8% decrease on the previous quarter (1,050) and a 3% decrease from the same quarter in 2016 (993). This quarter also showed a significant decline in the number of deals worth more than USD 0.5 billion from the last quarter (7 vs. 17). This article will highlight a number of the most valuable and notable deals forged during the quarter, as well as a selection of deals from some of the most prolific deal makers in the life sciences. An update on milestone, options and terminated deals of significance will also be presented, along with an early outlook on the next quarter's pharmaceutical licensing activity.", "Strabismus (misalignment of the eyes) is a risk factor for impaired visual development both of visual acuity and of stereopsis. Detection of strabismus in the community by non-expert examiners may be performed using a number of different index tests that include direct measures of misalignment (corneal or fundus reflex tests), or indirect measures such as stereopsis and visual acuity. The reference test to detect strabismus by trained professionals is the cover\u2012uncover test.\nTo assess and compare the accuracy of tests, alone or in combination, for detection of strabismus in children aged 1 to 6 years, in a community setting by non-expert screeners or primary care professionals to inform healthcare commissioners setting up childhood screening programmes.Secondary objectives were to investigate sources of heterogeneity of diagnostic accuracy.\nWe searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2016, Issue 12) (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register) in the Cochrane Library, the Health Technology Assessment Database (HTAD) in the Cochrane Library (2016, Issue 4), MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 5 January 2017), Embase Ovid (1947 to 5 January 2017), CINAHL (January 1937 to 5 January 2017), Web of Science Conference Proceedings Citation Index-Science (CPCI-S) (January 1990 to 5 January 2017), BIOSIS Previews (January 1969 to 5 January 2017), MEDION (to 18 August 2014), the Aggressive Research Intelligence Facility database (ARIF) (to 5 January 2017), the ISRCTN registry (www.isrctn.com/editAdvancedSearch); searched 5 January 2017, ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov); searched 5 January 2017 and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en); searched 5 January 2017. We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. In addition, orthoptic journals and conference proceedings without electronic listings were searched.\nAll prospective or retrospective population-based test accuracy studies of consecutive participants were included. Studies compared a single or combination of index tests with the reference test. Only those studies with sufficient data for analysis were included specifically to calculate sensitivity and specificity and determine diagnostic accuracy.Participants were aged 1 to 6 years. Studies reporting participants outside this range were included if subgroup data were available.Permitted settings included population-based vision screening programmes or opportunistic screening programmes, such as those performed in schools.\nWe used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. In brief, two review authors independently assessed titles and abstracts for eligibility and extracted the data, with a third senior author resolving any disagreement. We analysed data primarily for specificity and sensitivity.\nOne study from a total of 1236 papers, abstracts and trials was eligible for inclusion with a total number of participants of 335 of which 271 completed both the screening test and the gold standard test. The screening test using an automated photoscreener had a sensitivity of 0.46 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.19 to 0.75) and specificity of 0.97 (CI 0.94 to 0.99). The overall number affected by strabismus was low at 13 (4.8%).\nThere is very limited data in the literature to ascertain the accuracy of tests for detecting strabismus in the community as performed by non-expert screeners. A large prospective study to compare methods would be required to determine which tests have the greatest accuracy.", "The problems associated with violence during adolescence have been on the rise in recent decades. Many studies have focused only on environmental causes or individual causes of violence, although a combination of both variables would seem to be the best option for prediction. The current study aims to assess the relevance of individual characteristics (personality traits, intelligence, and historical and clinical factors linked to the risk of violence), contextual risk factors and protective factors in explaining antisocial and delinquent behaviors in adolescence by comparing three different samples: a community sample, a sample at risk of social exclusion, and a sample of juvenile offenders. The results show that the samples at risk of social exclusion and the sample of juvenile offenders have a very similar profile in terms of personality traits and intelligence, although they differ from the community sample. However, these two samples do differ in such contextual variables as peer delinquency, poor parental management, community disorganization, or early caregiver disruption.", "Stochastic biomechanical modeling has become a useful tool most commonly implemented using Monte Carlo simulation, advanced mean value theorem, or Markov chain modeling. Bayesian networks are a novel method for probabilistic modeling in artificial intelligence, risk modeling, and machine learning. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the suitability of Bayesian networks for biomechanical modeling using a static biomechanical model of spinal forces during lifting. A 20-node Bayesian network model was used to implement a well-established static two-dimensional biomechanical model for predicting L5/S1 compression and shear forces. The model was also implemented as a Monte Carlo simulation in MATLAB. Mean L5/S1 spinal compression force estimates differed by 0.8%, and shear force estimates were the same. The model was extended to incorporate evidence about disc injury, which can modify the prior probability estimates to provide posterior probability estimates of spinal compression force. An example showed that changing disc injury status from false to true increased the estimate of mean L5/S1 compression force by 14.7%. This work shows that Bayesian networks can be used to implement a whole-body biomechanical model used in occupational biomechanics and incorporate disc injury.", "Rather than a historical overview as in Chap. 2, this chapter provides the reader with insight into the various approaches that have been used to understand clinical reasoning. We review concepts and major scholars who have been involved in such investigations. Cognitive psychologists Newel and Simon theorized about problem-solving skills and artificial intelligence and initiated the use of computers as metaphors of thinking. Elstein and colleagues found that there is no such thing as a general problem-solving skill, independent of medical knowledge, and thus clinical reasoning is case specific. Reasoning then became analyzed in approaches, including forward reasoning from data to diagnosis; hypothetico-deductive reasoning with backward nature, from hypothesis to diagnosis; and abductive reasoning to understand early hypothesis generation that is so characteristic in clinical reasoning, elaborated by Patel and colleagues. Bordage introduced prototypes to characterize how physicians may remember illness presentations and semantic qualifiers to denote the shortened conceptual language and labels physicians use to store medical information systematically in memory. Illness scripts represent how encounters with diseases are remembered by physicians and were introduced by Feltovich and Barrows. Schmidt and Boshuizen elaborated the concept further and propose encapsulation of knowledge as a hypothetical process that happens when physicians regularly and routinely apply shortcuts in thinking typically ellaborated as pathophysiology. Reasoning ability appears not only to be case specific-- it is also situation or\u00a0context specific. Clinicians with broad reasoning ability have extensive experience. Deliberate practice with many cases and in varying contexts is recommended by Ericsson to acquire reasoning expertise. To improve reasoning, some authors have focused on cognitive biases and error prevention. Norman, however, concludes that bias reduction strategies are unlikely to be successful but correcting knowledge deficiencies is\u00a0likely to lead to reasoning success. Kahnemann promoted System 1 and System 2 thinking for instant pattern recognition (nonanalytic reasoning) and analytic reasoning, respectively. What actually happens in the brain during clinical reasoning is the domain of neuroscience, which may provide insights from research in the near future.", "Cerebral palsy (CP) is a disorder of motor function often accompanied by cognitive impairment. There is a paucity of research focused on cognition in dyskinetic CP and on the potential effect of related factors.\nTo describe the cognitive profile in dyskinetic CP and to assess its relationship with motor function and associated impairments.\nFifty-two subjects with dyskinetic CP (28 males, mean age 24\u00a0y 10\u00a0mo, SD 13\u00a0y) and 52 typically-developing controls (age- and gender-matched) completed a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment. Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS), Communication Function Classification System (CFCS) and epilepsy were recorded. Cognitive performance was compared between control and CP groups, also according different levels of GMFCS. The relationship between cognition, CFCS and epilepsy was examined through partial correlation coefficients, controlling for GMFCS.\nDyskinetic CP participants performed worse than controls on all cognitive functions except for verbal memory. Milder cases (GMFCS I) only showed impairment in attention, visuoperception and visual memory. Participants with GMFCS II-III also showed impairment in language-related functions. Severe cases (GMFCS IV-V) showed impairment in intelligence and all specific cognitive functions but verbal memory. CFCS was associated with performance in receptive language functions. Epilepsy was related to performance in intelligence, visuospatial abilities, visual memory, grammar comprehension and learning.\nCognitive performance in dyskinetic CP varies with the different levels of motor impairment, with more cognitive functions impaired as motor severity increases. This study also demonstrates the relationship between communication and epilepsy and cognitive functioning, even controlling for the effect of motor severity.", "To develop a neural network for the estimation of visual acuity from optical coherence tomography (OCT) images of patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and to demonstrate its use to model the impact of specific controlled OCT changes on vision.\nArtificial intelligence (neural network) study.\nWe assessed 1400 OCT scans of patients with neovascular AMD. Fifteen physical features for each eligible OCT, as well as patient age, were used as input data and corresponding recorded visual acuity as the target data to train, validate, and test a supervised neural network. We then applied this network to model the impact on acuity of defined OCT changes in subretinal fluid, subretinal hyperreflective material, and loss of external limiting membrane (ELM) integrity.\nA total of 1210 eligible OCT scans were analyzed, resulting in 1210 data points, which were each 16-dimensional. A 10-layer feed-forward neural network with 1 hidden layer of 10 neurons was trained to predict acuity and demonstrated a root mean square error of 8.2 letters for predicted compared to actual visual acuity and a mean regression coefficient of 0.85. A virtual model using this network demonstrated the relationship of visual acuity to specific, programmed changes in OCT characteristics. When ELM is intact, there is a shallow decline in acuity with increasing subretinal fluid but a much steeper decline with equivalent increasing subretinal hyperreflective material. When ELM is not intact, all visual acuities are reduced. Increasing subretinal hyperreflective material or subretinal fluid in this circumstance reduces vision further still, but with a smaller gradient than when ELM is intact.\nThe supervised machine learning neural network developed is able to generate an estimated visual acuity value from OCT images in a population of patients with AMD. These findings should be of clinical and research interest in macular degeneration, for example in estimating visual prognosis or highlighting the importance of developing treatments targeting more visually destructive pathologies.", "Intelligent assistive technologies that complement and extend human abilities have proliferated in recent years. Service robots, home automation equipment, and other digital assistant devices possessing artificial intelligence are forms of assistive technologies that have become popular in society. Older adults (>55 years of age) have been identified by industry, government, and researchers as a demographic who can benefit significantly from the use of intelligent assistive technology to support various activities of daily living.\nThe purpose of this scoping review is to summarize the literature on the importance of the concept of \"trust\" in the adoption of intelligent assistive technologies to assist aging in place by older adults.\nUsing a scoping review methodology, our search strategy will examine the following databases: ACM Digital Library, Allied and Complementary Medicine Database (AMED), Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Medline, PsycINFO, Scopus, and Web of Science. Two reviewers will independently screen the initial titles obtained from the search, and these results will be further inspected by other members of the research team for inclusion in the review.\nThis review will provide insights into how the concept of trust is actualized in the adoption of intelligent assistive technology by older adults. Preliminary sensitization to the literature suggests that the concept of trust is fluid, unstable, and intimately tied to the type of intelligent assistive technology being examined. Furthermore, a wide range of theoretical lenses that include elements of trust have been used to examine this concept.\nThis review will describe the concept of trust in the adoption of intelligent assistive technology by older adults, and will provide insights for practitioners, policy makers, and technology vendors for future practice.", "Machine learning methods have been applied to many data sets in pharmaceutical research for several decades. The relative ease and availability of fingerprint type molecular descriptors paired with Bayesian methods resulted in the widespread use of this approach for a diverse array of end points relevant to drug discovery. Deep learning is the latest machine learning algorithm attracting attention for many of pharmaceutical applications from docking to virtual screening. Deep learning is based on an artificial neural network with multiple hidden layers and has found considerable traction for many artificial intelligence applications. We have previously suggested the need for a comparison of different machine learning methods with deep learning across an array of varying data sets that is applicable to pharmaceutical research. End points relevant to pharmaceutical research include absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADME/Tox) properties, as well as activity against pathogens and drug discovery data sets. In this study, we have used data sets for solubility, probe-likeness, hERG, KCNQ1, bubonic plague, Chagas, tuberculosis, and malaria to compare different machine learning methods using FCFP6 fingerprints. These data sets represent whole cell screens, individual proteins, physicochemical properties as well as a data set with a complex end point. Our aim was to assess whether deep learning offered any improvement in testing when assessed using an array of metrics including AUC, F1 score, Cohen's kappa, Matthews correlation coefficient and others. Based on ranked normalized scores for the metrics or data sets Deep Neural Networks (DNN) ranked higher than SVM, which in turn was ranked higher than all the other machine learning methods. Visualizing these properties for training and test sets using radar type plots indicates when models are inferior or perhaps over trained. These results also suggest the need for assessing deep learning further using multiple metrics with much larger scale comparisons, prospective testing as well as assessment of different fingerprints and DNN architectures beyond those used.", "The effect of morningness-eveningness, sleep habits, and intelligence on academic performance has been studied in a fixed morning school shift. However, no studies have analysed these variables in an afternoon school shift and tested whether morningness-eveningness is related to academic performance beyond sleep habits and intelligence effects.\nThe psychometric properties of the Morningness-Eveningness Scale for Children (MESC) were analysed. Additionally, academic performance, sex, intelligence, sleep habits, and morningness-eveningness relationship in a morning and afternoon school shift were compared.\nThe sample consisted of 400 students at a secondary public school in Reynosa, Tamaulipas, in north-eastern Mexico (195 boys and 205 girls; mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD: 13.85\u00a0\u00b1 0.70\u00a0years old) attending a double-shift school system: 200 from the morning shift (99 boys and 101 girls) and 200 from the afternoon shift (96 boys and 104 girls).\nThe students completed the MESC as a measure of morningness-eveningness, a sleep habits survey, a test of academic performance, and the inductive reasoning subtest (R) of the Primary Mental Abilities battery.\nAdolescents in the two school shifts did not differ in academic performance and intelligence. In the afternoon shift, adolescents slept longer, reported less sleep deficit and social jet lag, and were more oriented to eveningness than adolescents in the morning shift. Sex (girls), sleep length, inductive reasoning, and morningness were associated with academic performance in the morning shift but only sex and intelligence in the afternoon shift.\nThe role of morningness-eveningness in academic performance in the afternoon shift is examined.", "Noteworthy changes coming to the practice of medicine require significant medical education reforms. While proposals for such reforms abound, they are insufficient because they do not adequately address the most fundamental change-the practice of medicine is rapidly transitioning from the information age to the age of artificial intelligence. Increasingly, future medical practice will be characterized by: the delivery of care wherever the patient happens to be; the provision of care by newly constituted health care teams; the use of a growing array of data from multiple sources and artificial intelligence applications; and the skillful management of the interface between medicine and machines. To be effective in this environment, physicians must work at the top of their license, have knowledge spanning the health professions and care continuum, effectively leverage data platforms, focus on analyzing outcomes and improving performance, and communicate the meaning of the probabilities generated by massive amounts of data to patients, given their unique human complexities. The authors believe that a \"reboot\" of medical education is required that makes better use of the findings of cognitive psychology and pays more attention to the alignment of humans and machines in education and practice. Medical education needs to move beyond the foundational biomedical and clinical sciences. Systematic curricular attention must focus on the organization of professional effort among health professionals, the use of intelligence tools involving large data sets, and machine learning and robots, all the while assuring the mastery of compassionate care.", "In dental education, professionalism has been viewed as a requirement in order to achieve and maintain competence in the practice of dentistry. The Professionalism Mini-Evaluation Exercise (P-MEX), a 21-item instrument validated in medicine, is often used to measure the following observable professionalism behaviors: doctor-patient relationship, reflective skills, time management skills, and interprofessional relationship skills. Emotional intelligence (EI) is defined as the ability to accurately perceive emotions in oneself and in others in order to improve performance and personal growth. The primary aim of this study was to elucidate for dental education the relationship of professionalism as measured by the P-MEX to EI as measured by the Emotional Quotient Inventory (EQ-i) 2.0, and the secondary aim was to explore relationships between EQ-i 2.0 subscales and the P-MEX. A correlational cohort study was conducted in 2015-16 in which the EQ-i 2.0 was administered to dental students at one U.S. dental school at the end of their second year as they began their clinical education experience. Out of a total class of 66 students, 49 (74%) were chosen to participate through randomized selection in order to have about 12 students per team clinic group. The P-MEX evaluations were collected eight months later in three settings: the comprehensive care clinic, community outreach clinics, and clinical care seminars. The students' EQ-i 2.0 mean scores and P-MEX mean scores resulted in a non-significant correlation. However, the EQ-i 2.0 subscales self-actualization and happiness were significantly correlated with the P-MEX mean scores. These results suggest that there was a relationship between these students' EI and professionalism, which supports the use of both for the evaluation and development of professionalism through a multiple triangulated effort.", "Emotional intelligence (EI) is the ability to use emotions effectively and productively. It is becoming increasingly clear that these skills are one of the primary foundations for better performance of students in classrooms and in the society as well and EI provides the basis for competencies important \"in almost every job.\" So we accessed the EI of teenagers as a guide of their academic score.\nWe analyzed the correlation of academic score to the EI of teenagers in regular schools and part-time unconventional coaching institute using the Bar-On Emotional Quotient questionnaire.\nThe results of our study showed that empathy and self-actualization were highly developed in students of regular conventional school than those attending part-time unconventional coaching institute. The academic score had a significantly positive correlation with empathy, whereas a significantly negative correlation with interpersonal relations. Empathy, interpersonal relation, and impulsive control were significantly higher in females than males. Therefore by inculcating and working toward development of EI in the young generation, we can hope to achieve a more positive environment.\nSekhri P, Sandhu M, Sachdev V. Emerging Understanding of Emotional Intelligence of Teenagers. Int J Clin Pediatr Dent 2017;10(3):289-292.", "To investigate whether and how doctors' attachment styles and emotional intelligence (EI) might influence patients' emotional expressions in general practice consultations.\nVideo recordings of 26 junior doctors consulting with 173 patients were coded using the Verona Coding Definition of Emotional Sequences (VR-CoDES). Doctors' attachment style was scored across two dimensions, avoidance and anxiety, using the Experiences in Close Relationships: Short Form questionnaire. EI was assessed with the Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test. Multilevel Poisson regressions modelled the probability of patients' expressing emotional distress, considering doctors' attachment styles and EI and demographic and contextual factors.\nBoth attachment styles and EI were significantly associated with frequency of patients' cues, with patient- and doctor-level explanatory variables accounting for 42% of the variance in patients' cues. The relative contribution of attachment styles and EI varied depending on whether patients' presenting complaints were physical or psychosocial in nature.\nDoctors' attachment styles and levels of EI are associated with patients' emotional expressions in primary care consultations. Further research is needed to investigate how these two variables interact and influence provider responses and patient outcomes.\nUnderstanding how doctors' psychological characteristics influence PPC may help to optimise undergraduate and postgraduate medical education.", "Theory of Mind (ToM), i.e. the ability to understand others' mental states, endows humans with highly adaptive social skills such as teaching or deceiving. Candidate evolutionary explanations have been proposed for the unique sophistication of human ToM among primates. For example, the Machiavellian intelligence hypothesis states that the increasing complexity of social networks may have induced a demand for sophisticated ToM. This type of scenario ignores neurocognitive constraints that may eventually be crucial limiting factors for ToM evolution. In contradistinction, the cognitive scaffolding hypothesis asserts that a species' opportunity to develop sophisticated ToM is mostly determined by its general cognitive capacity (on which ToM is scaffolded). However, the actual relationships between ToM sophistication and either brain volume (a proxy for general cognitive capacity) or social group size (a proxy for social network complexity) are unclear. Here, we let 39 individuals sampled from seven non-human primate species (lemurs, macaques, mangabeys, orangutans, gorillas and chimpanzees) engage in simple dyadic games against artificial ToM players (via a familiar human caregiver). Using computational analyses of primates' choice sequences, we found that the probability of exhibiting a ToM-compatible learning style is mainly driven by species' brain volume (rather than by social group size). Moreover, primates' social cognitive sophistication culminates in a precursor form of ToM, which still falls short of human fully-developed ToM abilities.", "Complexities in food supply chains were highlighted by the so called 'horsegate' crisis in 2013, where beef meat was fraudulently adulterated with horse meat causing widespread recalls and subsequent investigations across both retail and food service markets in the European Union (EU). The beef supply chain is a complex supply chain, with global (EU and Non EU) sourcing strategies in order to secure supply. However, managing these complex supply chains can be difficult and consequentially can expose vulnerabilities similar to that of horsemeat, where horsemeat was found in beef meat within EU supply chains. Six months after the crisis broke, an independent review into the integrity and assurance of food supply networks was commissioned by the UK government and undertaken by Professor Chris Elliott of Queen's University, Belfast. The review recommended eight pillars of food integrity to industry and government: consumers first, zero tolerance, intelligence gathering, laboratory services, audit, government support, leadership and crisis management. This article examines the extent to which these recommendations have been implemented using personal communications from Professor Chris Elliott and relevant industry bodies. Following the review, industry attitudes have changed substantially, testing and surveillance systems have been integrated into normal industry practice and the government is more prepared for future incidents through the establishment of the National Food Crime Unit (NFCU). Horsegate raised the profile of food fraud and crime in supply chains and despite improvements to date, further collaboration between industry and government is required in order to align fully with the recommendations.", "Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation method that allows to directly modulate brain oscillations of a given frequency. Using this method, it was recently shown that increasing alpha (10Hz) oscillations improved creative ideation with figural material and that increasing gamma (40Hz) oscillations speeded up performance in a figural matrices intelligence task. The aim of the present study was to examine whether these findings generalize to verbal creativity and intelligence tasks. In addition, we explored whether the stimulation effects are moderated by individual differences in creative potential and intelligence. Twenty-two adults received 10Hz, 40Hz and sham tACS while they worked on a verbal creativity (alternate uses) task and a verbal intelligence (anagram) task. Analyses revealed that 10Hz stimulation had a marginally significant effect on ideational fluency in the alternate uses task, whereas originality was unaffected. The beneficial effect of stimulation on fluency tended to emerge mainly in the individuals with higher creative potential. In the verbal intelligence task, in contrast, 40Hz stimulation did neither impact on performance nor interacted with individual differences in intelligence. These findings provide first tentative evidence that enhancing alpha oscillations through tACS may improve creative thinking not only in the figural but also in the verbal domain. The previously reported beneficial effect of gamma tACS on figural intelligence, however, could not be observed in a verbal task. In sum, the present study further corroborates the causal link between alpha oscillations and creative thinking and suggests that tACS may be a promising tool to enhance cognitive processes.", "The expertise effect in memory for chess positions is one of the most robust effects in cognitive psychology. One explanation of this effect is that chess recall is based on the recognition of familiar patterns and that experts have learned more and larger patterns. Template theory and its instantiation as a computational model are based on this explanation. An alternative explanation is that the expertise effect is due, in part, to stronger players having better and more conceptual knowledge, with this knowledge facilitating memory performance. Our literature review supports the latter view. In our experiment, a sample of 79 chess players were given a test of memory for chess positions, a test of declarative chess knowledge, a test of fluid intelligence, and a questionnaire concerning the amount of time they had played nontournament chess and the amount of time they had studied chess. We determined the numbers of tournament games the players had played from chess databases. Chess knowledge correlated .67 with chess memory and accounted for 16% of the variance after controlling for chess experience. Fluid intelligence accounted for an additional 13% of the variance. These results support the conclusion that both high-level conceptual processing and low-level recognition of familiar patterns play important roles in memory for chess positions.", "Recent evidence suggests that paternal age at birth influences myriad developmental outcomes among children, but few studies have examined the possibility for father's age to influence children's intellectual development among a sample of high-risk families. The authors use data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study to examine the association between paternal age at birth among 480 male and 449 female children's verbal IQ scores, as assessed with a version of the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test at 9\u00a0years old. The nonlinear association between paternal age and children's verbal intelligence was also examined. Paternal age at birth appears to have a marginally significant nonlinear relationship with male children's verbal IQ scores, despite controlling for a number of possible confounders associated with both young and advanced paternal age.", "Fifty-seven percent of children with poor language skills are affected by socio-emotional problems. Despite the importance of language skills to interpersonal functioning and school performance, relatively little is known about how they affect self-esteem in adolescence. Data on youth at high risk for language problems (e.g. those born extremely low birth weight (ELBW; <1000 grams)) are even more scarce. This prospective study examined associations between language skills at age 8 and self-esteem during adolescence (12-16 years) in individuals born at ELBW ( N = 138) or normal birth weight (NBW; >2500 grams) ( N = 111). Participants' language skills were assessed using the Verbal Scale of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised and the Token Test at age 8. In adolescence, participants completed the Harter Self-Perception Profile for Adolescents. Birth weight status was found to moderate associations between childhood language and adolescent global self-esteem (Token Test ( p = .006), Verbal Intelligence Quotient ( p = .033)) such that better language skills were associated with higher self-esteem in adolescent ELBW survivors, but not in NBW participants. Language skills may play a protective role in the development and maintenance of self-esteem in ELBW youth and could be an important target for optimizing their functioning, particularly before transitioning to the critical adolescent period.", "Intelligence can have an extremely high heritability, but also be malleable; a paradox that has been the source of continuous controversy. Here we attempt to clarify the issue, and advance a frequently overlooked solution to the paradox: Intelligence is a trait with unusual properties that create a large reservoir of hidden gene-environment (GE) networks, allowing for the contribution of high genetic and environmental influences on individual differences in IQ. GE interplay is difficult to specify with current methods, and is underestimated in standard metrics of heritability (thus inflating estimates of \"genetic\" effects). We describe empirical evidence for GE interplay in intelligence, with malleability existing on top of heritability. The evidence covers cognitive gains consequent to adoption/immigration, changes in IQ's heritability across life span and socioeconomic status, gains in IQ over time consequent to societal development (the Flynn effect), the slowdown of age-related cognitive decline, and the gains in intelligence from early education. The GE solution has novel implications for enduring problems, including our inability to identify intelligence-related genes (also known as IQ's \"missing heritability\"), and the loss of initial benefits from early intervention programs (such as \"Head Start\"). The GE solution can be a powerful guide to future research, and may also aid policies to overcome barriers to the development of intelligence, particularly in impoverished and underprivileged populations. (PsycINFO Database Record", "The application of artificial intelligence to extract predictors of Gambling disorder (GD) is a new field of study. A plethora of studies have suggested that maladaptive personality dispositions may serve as risk factors for GD.\nHere, we used Classification and Regression Trees algorithm to identify multivariate predictive patterns of personality profiles that could identify GD patients from healthy controls at an individual level. Forty psychiatric patients, recruited from specialized gambling clinics, without any additional comorbidity and 160 matched healthy controls completed the Five-Factor model of personality as measured by the NEO-PI-R, which were used to build the classification model.\nClassification algorithm was able to discriminate individuals with GD from controls with an AUC of 77.3% (95% CI 0.65-0.88, p<0.0001). A multidimensional construct of traits including sub-facets of openness, neuroticism and conscientiousness was employed by algorithm for classification detection.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that combines behavioral data with machine learning approach useful to extract multidimensional features characterizing GD realm.\nOur study provides a proof-of-concept demonstrating the potential of the proposed approach for GD diagnosis. The multivariate combination of personality facets characterizing individuals with GD can potentially be used to assess subjects' vulnerability in clinical setting.", "The search for objective clinical signs is a constant practitioners' and researchers' concern in psychiatry. New technologies (embedded sensors, artificial intelligence) give an easier access to untapped information such as passive data (i.e. that do not require patient intervention). The concept of \"digital phenotype\" is emerging in psychiatry: a psychomotor alteration translated by accelerometer's modifications contrasting with the usual functioning of the subject, or the graphorrhea of patients presenting a manic episode which is replaced by an increase of SMS sent. Our main objective is to highlight the digital phenotype of mood disorders by means of a selective review of the literature.\nWe conducted a selective review of the literature by querying the PubMed database until February 2017 with the terms [Computer] [Computerized] [Machine] [Automatic] [Automated] [Heart rate variability] [HRV] [actigraphy] [actimetry] [digital] [motion] [temperature] [Mood] [Bipolar] [Depression] [Depressive]. Eight hundred and forty-nine articles were submitted for evaluation, 37 articles were included.\nFor unipolar disorders, smartphones can diagnose depression with excellent accuracy by combining GPS and call log data. Actigraphic measurements showing daytime alteration in basal function while ECG sensors assessing variation in heart rate variability (HRV) and body temperature appear to be useful tools to diagnose a depressive episode. For bipolar disorders, systems which combine several sensors are described: MONARCA, PRIORI, SIMBA and PSYCHE. All these systems combine passive and active data on smartphones. From a synthesis of these data, a digital phenotype of the disorders is proposed based on the accelerometer and the GPS, the ECG, the body temperature, the use of the smartphone and the voice. This digital phenotype thus brings into question certain clinical paradigms in which psychiatrists evolve.\nAll these systems can be used to computerize the clinical characteristics of the various mental states studied, sometimes with greater precision than a clinician could do. Most authors recommend the use of passive data rather than active data in the context of bipolar disorders because automatically generated data reduce biases and limit the feeling of intrusion that self-questionnaires may cause. The impact of these technologies questions the psychiatrist's professional culture, defined as a specific language and a set of common values. We address issues related to these changes. Impact on psychiatrists could be important because their unity seems to be questioned due to technologies that profoundly modify the collect and process of clinical data.", "Individuals with a family history of alcohol and other drug use disorders (FH+) are at increased risk for developing substance use disorders themselves relative to those with no such histories (FH-). Here we sought to identify key characteristics associated with FH+ status and alcohol and other drug use disorder status in a large cohort of FH+ and FH- young adults. We conducted principal component analyses on demographic, temperament, and cognitive measures differentiating 506 FH+ and 528 FH- young adults. Three principal components were identified, and these component scores were then used to predict the odds of being FH+ and the odds of having an alcohol or other drug use disorder. Component 1 consisted of measures indexing internalizing traits, with higher component scores indicating greater depressive, anxious, and emotional instability tendencies. Component 2 consisted of measures of externalizing traits as well as exposure to early life adversity (ELA), with higher scores indicating less impulse control, more antisocial behavior, and greater ELA exposure. Component 3 consisted of estimated intelligence, delay discounting, and demographic characteristics, with higher scores indicating lower estimated intelligence, greater discounting of delayed rewards, less education, and lower childhood socioeconomic status. For each 1-point increase in the Component 1, 2, and 3 scores, the odds of being classified FH+ increased by 2%, 8%, and 4%, respectively. Similar findings were observed when individuals with alcohol or other drug use disorders were removed from the analyses. Finally, greater Component 2 scores were also associated with increased odds of having an alcohol or other drug use disorder. Collectively, these findings provide a more comprehensive understanding of the FH+ phenotype in young adults and help form a basis for further studies on biological mechanisms underlying risk for substance use disorders. The present findings also provide further support for a prominent role of ELA in promoting risk for problem alcohol and other drug use.", "Children with autism spectrum disorder have deficits in adaptive functioning. This study examines the adaptive behavior, its association with cognitive ability, gender, age, and symptom severity in children with autism spectrum disorder. Using data from Autism Treatment Network registry, the adaptive behavior profiles were examined in 2538 school-aged children (between 5 and 17 years, mean: 8.8 years, standard deviation: 3.0) who had an overall intelligence quotient and Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale scores available. The children were grouped according to their intelligence quotient (low intelligence quotient < 70; borderline intelligence quotient = 70-85; average intelligence quotient > 85), age (5-10 and 11-17 years), and gender for the analyses. Significantly lower Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale scores were found in borderline and average intelligence quotient groups when compared to mean intelligence quotient, while an opposite pattern was seen in the low intelligence quotient group, with better adaptive behavior scores than mean intelligence quotient. Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale standard scores were positively correlated with intelligence quotient and poorly associated with autism spectrum disorder severity. Younger children had significantly higher Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale scores. Adjusted comparisons by gender were not significant. Adaptive behavior profiles in the intelligence quotient categories are discussed. This study confirms a positive relationship between adaptive behavior and intellectual function in autism and indicates that children with higher intelligence quotient and older age are specifically impaired, with lower adaptive behavior, highlighting the need for assessment and targeted intervention in these groups. Future directions for research are discussed.", "Numerous meta-analyses have summarized studies comparing the neurocognitive performance of individuals with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) to that of healthy controls.\nThe present study is a systematic review and quantitative summary of those meta-analyses that aimed to determine the extent to which individuals with ADHD differ cognitively from typically developing controls.\nOf 253 standardized mean differences (SMDs) drawn from 34 meta-analyses, 244 (96%) were positive, indicating better neurocognitive performance in the control group than the ADHD group. The mean effect size was .45 (SD = .27). Unweighted means of SMDs for neurocognitive domains ranged from .35 (set shifting) to .54 (working memory). When weighted by the number of studies aggregated, they ranged from .35 (set shifting) to .66 (reaction time variability). Neurocognitive domains with mean effects over .50 included working memory (.54), reaction time variability (.53), response inhibition (.52), intelligence/achievement (.51), and planning/organization (.51). When weighted by number of aggregated studies, the domains with mean effects over .50 were reaction time variability (.66), intelligence/achievement (.60), vigilance (.56), working memory (.54), and response inhibition (.52). Age moderated the relationship between ADHD diagnosis and neurocognitive functioning, with greater between-groups differences among children and adults than among adolescents. Funding also moderated this relationship: meta-analyses that received drug funding found larger effect sizes than those without drug funding.\nThe evidence suggests that ADHD is associated with substantial deficits across a variety of neurocognitive domains. This is the most in-depth review of the neurocognitive functioning of people with ADHD to date.", "Schizophrenia (SCZ), is considered as one of the most debilitating mental disorders around the world. Symptom-based clinical interview and numerous tests have been used to evaluate the diagnosis and also cognitive disturbances in patients with SCZ. All these tests measure phenotype-based functions. Thus, it seems accurate diagnosis of such complex disorders must rely on more valid and reliable factors. In this study, we evaluated the association of transcription factor 4 (TCF4) gene mRNA level in peripheral blood with SCZ, and also its psychopathology, cognitive and intellectual impairments. In this study, using real-time PCR, we compared TCF4 mRNA level between the case (70 unmedicated schizophrenia patients) and healthy control (n\u2009=\u200972) groups. In addition, all subjects underwent Psychopathology (PANSS) and cognitive and intelligence (WAIS, WMS, Stroop, WCST) assessments, and scores were compared between the two groups. Also, to determine the effect of TCF4 expression on psychopathology, cognitive and intellectual functions, the correlation between expression level and test scores was measured. The correlation between gene expression and age of onset and duration of the disorder was evaluated as well. Our results showed that the TCF4 mRNA level, psychopathology, cognitive and intellectual functions were significantly different in all, male, and female patients compared to healthy participants. Additionally, it was found that TCF4 level is positively correlated with scores of WAIS and WMS and is negatively correlated with Stroop and WCST errors and PANSS score. Our results showed that the mRNA level of TCF4 may be associated with SCZ, its psychopathology, IQ and cognitive impairments in an Iranian group of patients with SCZ. These results may help to better understanding the TCF4 role in the psychopathogenesis of SCZ and also may shed some light on the ongoing works conducted on peripheral biomarker-based diagnosis of complicated mental disorders.", "How will the robot age transform warfare? What geopolitical futures are being imagined by the US military? This article constructs a robotic futurology to examine these crucial questions. Its central concern is how robots - driven by leaps in artificial intelligence and swarming - are rewiring the spaces and logics of US empire, warfare, and geopolitics. The article begins by building a more-than-human geopolitics to de-center the role of humans in conflict and foreground a worldly understanding of robots. The article then analyzes the idea of US empire, before speculating upon how and why robots are materializing new forms of proxy war. A three-part examination of the shifting spaces of US empire then follows: (1) Swarm Wars explores the implications of miniaturized drone swarming; (2) Roboworld investigates how robots are changing US military basing strategy and producing new topological spaces of violence; and (3) The Autogenic Battle-Site reveals how autonomous robots will produce emergent, technologically event-ful sites of security and violence - revolutionizing the battlespace. The conclusion reflects on the rise of a robotic US empire and its consequences for democracy.", "Rolandic epilepsy (RE) is characterized by typical interictal-electroencephalogram (EEG) patterns mainly localized in centrotemporal and parietooccipital areas. An aberrant intrinsic organization of the default mode network (DMN) due to repeated disturbances from spike-generating areas may be able to account for specific cognitive deficits and behavioral problems in RE. The aim of the present study was to investigate cognitive development (CD) and socioemotional development (SED) in patients with RE during active disease in relation to DMN connectivity and network topology.\nIn 10 children with RE and active EEG, CD was assessed using the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-IV (WISC-IV); SED was assessed using the F\u00fcnf-Faktoren-Fragebogen f\u00fcr Kinder (FFFK), a Big-Five inventory for the assessment of personality traits in children. Functional connectivity (FC) in the DMN was determined from a 15-minute resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and network properties were calculated using standard graph-theoretical measures.\nMore severe deficits of verbal abilities tended to be associated with an earlier age at epilepsy onset, but were not directly related to the number of seizures and disease duration. Nonetheless, at the network level, disease duration was associated with alterations of the efficiency and centrality of parietal network nodes and midline structures. Particularly, centrality of the left inferior parietal lobe (IPL) was found to be linked with CD. Reduced centrality of the left IPL and alterations supporting a rather segregated processing within DMN's subsystems was associated with a more favorable CD. A more complicated SED was associated with high seizure frequency and long disease duration, and revealed links with a less favorable CD.\nAn impaired CD and - because of their interrelation - SED might be mediated by a common pathomechanism reflected in an aberrant organization, and thus, a potential functional deficit of the DMN. A functional segregation of (left) parietal network nodes from the DMN and a rather segregated processing mode within the DMN might have positive implications/protective value for CD in patients with RE.", "Although certain visuospatial abilities, such as mental rotation, are crucially important in everyday activities, they have been little explored in individuals with Down syndrome (DS). This study investigates: i) mental rotation ability in individuals with DS; and ii) its relation to cognitive abilities and to everyday spatial activities. Forty-eight individuals with DS and 48 typically-developing (TD) children, matched on measures of vocabulary and fluid intelligence, were compared on their performance in a rotation task that involved detecting which of two figures would fit into a hole if rotated (five angles of rotation were considered: 0\u00b0, 45\u00b0, 90\u00b0, 135\u00b0, 180\u00b0). Participants were also assessed on their visuospatial and verbal cognitive abilities, and on their parents and/or educators reports regarding their everyday spatial activities. Results showed that: (i) individuals with DS were less accurate in mental rotation than TD children, with larger differences between the groups for smaller angles of rotation; individuals with DS could not mentally rotate through 180\u00b0, while TD children could; (ii) mental rotation ability was related to fluid intelligence and to spatial activities (though other cognitive abilities are also involved in the latter) to a similar degree in the DS group and the matched TD children. These results are discussed with regard to the atypical development domain and spatial cognition models.", "Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a complicated neurodevelopmental disorder with high heritability. This study explores the association of PIK3CG gene single nucleotide polymorphisms (rs1129293, rs12536620, rs12667819, rs17847825, rs2230460) with ADHD in children and the relation of interaction between SNPs and environmental factors, including blood lead levels (BLLs) and feeding style. A case-control study was conducted with children aged 6-18years old, consisting of 389 children newly diagnosed with ADHD via the DSM-IV at the Wuhan Women and Children Medical Care Center, and 393 control participants were healthy children for physical examination during the same period. All participants were tested using the Chinese Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children and Parent Symptom Questionnaire (PSQ). Furthermore, a self-designed questionnaire was used to investigate the general situation and related environmental factors, and the BLLs were measured by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. The genotyping was performed using Sequenom MassArray. In our study, PIK3CG gene rs12667819 was consistently shown to be associated with ADHD risk in dominant model (OR=1.656, 95% CI=1.229-2.232), ADHD-I type (OR=2.278, 95% CI=1.666-4.632), and symptom scores. Moreover, rs12536620 has been observed to be related to ADHD-C type and symptom scores. Intriguingly, gene-environmental interactions analysis consistently revealed the potential interactions of rs12667819 collaborating with blood lead (Pmul=0.045) and feeding style (Pmul=0.041) to modify ADHD risk. Expression quantitative trait loci analysis suggested that rs12667819 may mediate PIK3CG gene expression. Therefore, our results suggest that selected PIK3CG gene variants may have a significant effect on ADHD risk.", "We define the entanglement-gradient routing scheme for quantum repeater networks. The routing framework fuses the fundamentals of swarm intelligence and quantum Shannon theory. Swarm intelligence provides nature-inspired solutions for problem solving. Motivated by models of social insect behavior, the routing is performed using parallel threads to determine the shortest path via the entanglement gradient coefficient, which describes the feasibility of the entangled links and paths of the network. The routing metrics are derived from the characteristics of entanglement transmission and relevant measures of entanglement distribution in quantum networks. The method allows a moderate complexity decentralized routing in quantum repeater networks. The results can be applied in experimental quantum networking, future quantum Internet, and long-distance quantum communications.", "The present study was conducted to accurately determine the presence of mild cognitive impairment, which is often difficult to evaluate using only simple tests. Our approach focused on discrepancy analysis of fluid intelligence relative to crystallized intelligence using internationally recognized neuropsychological tests.\nOne-hundred and five patients diagnosed with asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis were assessed. The neuropsychological tests included the two subtests (information and picture completion) of Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised (WAIS-R-two-subtests): crystallized intelligence tests and the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) (immediate memory, visuospatial/constructional, language, attention, delayed memory and total score) as fluid intelligence tests. Discrepancy analysis was used to assess cognitive impairment. The score for RBANS was subtracted from the score for WAIS-R-two-subtests, and if the score difference was greater than the 5% confidence limit for statistical significance, it was defined as a decline in cognitive function.\nThe WAIS-R-two-subsets was within normal limits when compared with the standardized values. However, all RBANS domains showed significant declines. Frequencies of decline in each RBANS domain were as follows: 69 patients (66%) in immediate memory, 26 (25%) in visuospatial/constructional, 54 (51%) in language, 63 (60%) in attention, 54 (51%) in delayed memory and 78 (74%) in the total score. Moreover, 99 patients (94%) showed decline in at least one RBANS domain.\nCognitive function is only preserved in a few patients with asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis. Mild cognitive impairment can be precisely detected by performing the discrepancy analysis between crystallized and fluid intelligence tests.", "The better use of new and emerging data streams to understand the epidemiology of infectious disease and to inform and evaluate antimicrobial stewardship improvement programmes is paramount in the global fight against antimicrobial resistance.\nTo create a national informatics platform that synergizes the wealth of disjointed, infection-related health data, building an intelligence capability that allows rapid enquiry, generation of new knowledge and feedback to clinicians and policy makers.\nA multi-stakeholder community, led by the Scottish Antimicrobial Prescribing Group, secured government funding to deliver a national programme of work centred on three key aspects: (i) technical platform development with record linkage capability across multiple datasets; (ii) a proportionate governance approach to enhance responsiveness; and (iii) generation of new evidence to guide clinical practice.\nThe National Health Service Scotland Infection Intelligence Platform (IIP) is now hosted within the national health data repository to assure resilience and sustainability. New technical solutions include simplified 'data views' of complex, linked datasets and embedded statistical programs to enhance capability. These developments have enabled responsiveness, flexibility and robustness in conducting population-based studies including a focus on intended and unintended effects of antimicrobial stewardship interventions and quantification of infection risk factors and clinical outcomes.\nWe have completed the build and test phase of IIP, overcoming the technical and governance challenges, and produced new capability in infection informatics, generating new evidence for improved clinical practice. This provides a foundation for expansion and opportunity for global collaborations.", "The world of biotechnology \"start-ups\" and entrepreneurship offers exciting new avenues for driving state-of-the-art research using an arsenal of multidisciplinary skills, whether your role is as part of a team or as a leader. Although traditionally these positions may not be as secure as those offered by some of the larger companies, the small start-up culture provides opportunities for contributing at many levels to a wide range of responsibilities: from scientific discovery to delivery of proof of concept and intellectual property; from analysis of market opportunities and competitive intelligence to creation of time lines and business plans for a first product. Often, if you get in on the ground level, you get to validate your own concept, pitch to potential investors, argue value, build a team, engage advisors, and then, with funding in hand, launch an entirely new research and development (R&D) enterprise. Many of the skills and much of the experience gained while pursuing a graduate degree can be put to good use in these arenas as well. This path, however, is not for the faint of heart; it requires not only a strong scientific background and organizational skills, but also the ability to work well on a team, excellent communication skills, and persistence when faced with delays or disappointment. With increasing responsibilities in the small company come the requirements for aptitudes for leadership, strategic and financial planning, networking, negotiating, and managing both projects and personnel.", "The study of collective decision-making spans various fields such as brain and behavioural sciences, economics, management sciences, and artificial intelligence. Despite these interdisciplinary applications, little is known regarding how a group of simple 'yes/no' units, such as neurons in the brain, can select the best option among multiple options. One prerequisite for achieving such correct choices by the brain is correct evaluation of relative option quality, which enables a collective decision maker to efficiently choose the best option. Here, we applied a sensory discrimination mechanism using yes/no units with differential thresholds to a model for making a collective choice among multiple options. The performance corresponding to the correct choice was shown to be affected by various parameters. High performance can be achieved by tuning the threshold distribution with the options' quality distribution. The number of yes/no units allocated to each option and its variability profoundly affects performance. When this variability is large, a quorum decision becomes superior to a majority decision under some conditions. The general features of this collective decision-making by a group of simple yes/no units revealed in this study suggest that this mechanism may be useful in applications across various fields.", "Low birthweight (LBW) babies account for >80% of neonatal mortality in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia and those who survive the neonatal period are still at risk of detrimental outcomes. LBW is a major public health problem in Malawi and strongly contributes to the country's high neonatal mortality rate. We aimed to get a better understanding of the care of LBW babies in rural Malawi in order to inform action to improve their outcomes.\nQualitative methods were used to identify challenges faced by caregivers and health workers within communities and at the rural facility level. We conducted 33 in-depth interviews (18 with caregivers; 15 with health workers) and 4 focus group discussions with caregivers. Interviews were recorded, transcribed and translated. Thematic analysis was used to index the data into themes and develop a robust analytical framework.\nCaregivers referred to LBW babies as weak, with poor health, stunted growth, developmental problems and lack of intelligence. Poor nutrition of the mother and illnesses during pregnancy were perceived to be important causes of LBW. Discrimination and stigma were described as a major challenge faced by carers of LBW babies. Problems related to feeding and the high burden of care were seen as another major challenge. Health workers described a lack of resources in health facilities, lack of adherence to counselling provided to carers and difficulties with continuity of care and follow-up in the community.\nThis study highlights that care of LBW babies in rural Malawi is compromised both at community and rural facility level with poverty and existing community perceptions constituting the main challenges. To make progress in reducing neonatal mortality and promoting better outcomes, we must develop integrated community-based care packages, improve care at facility level and strengthen the links between them.", "In the era of genetic engineering of pathogens, distinguishing unnatural epidemics from natural ones is a challenge. Successful identification of unnatural infectious disease events can assist in rapid response, which relies on a sensitive risk assessment tool used for the early detection of deliberate attacks (i.e., bioterrorism).\nA systematic review was conducted according to the outline of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews. Published papers related to the detection of unnatural diseases were searched in MEDLINE (January 1927-April 2016), EMBASE (January 1937-March 2016), and Web of Science (January 1978-March 2016). Full texts were reviewed for the selection of studies on scoring systems specially designed to discern between unnatural and natural outbreaks.\nA total of 1,753 papers were reviewed, of which we identified the following five scoring systems specifically designed for detecting unnatural outbreaks: (1) the Grunow-Finke epidemiological assessment tool, (2) potential epidemiological clues to a deliberate epidemic, (3) bioterrorism risk assessment scoring, (4) and (5) two modified scoring systems based on (3). Various criteria ranging from the information on perpetrators, type of agents, spatial distribution, and intelligence of deliberate release were involved. Of these systems, the Grunow-Finke assessment tool remains the most widely used, but has low sensitivity for correctly identifying unnatural epidemics when tested against actual historical outbreaks. Others were applied into a few scenarios but provided different perspectives for bioterrorism detection and bio-preparedness.\nThere are few risk assessment tools for differentiating unnatural from natural epidemics. These tools are increasingly necessary and valuable, but improved scoring systems with higher sensitivity, specificity, timeliness, and wider application to biological attacks must be developed.", "Background: Physical activity (PA) is considered one of the most important determinants of the health status in children, and predictor of morbidity/mortality in adults. The aim is to examine the relationship between physical fitness (PF), PA, obesity and academic performance (AP) in primary school children. Methods: Cross-sectional studies including 91 primary school students, aged 9 to 12 years, from the province of C\u00f3rdoba. Data was collected from April to June 2014. We measured PF using part of the EUROFIT fitness testing battery. The level of PA was measured as low or high PF and the level of obesity was measured using body mass index, waist circumference, percentage of fat mass, lean body mass, percentage of lean mass and basal metabolism. AP by scores on the second quarter was based on the total average of scores of basic subjects and other subjects, including physical education. Cognitive performance was assessed by the Spanish overall and factorial intelligence test. Results: The results of AP were positively related to levels of PF. Students who achieve better PF score better in Maths, (P=0.019), Natural Sciences (P=0.024), Religion (P=0.018) and Physical Education (P<0.001). A direct association between maximal aerobic capacity with Mathematics (r=0.325, P=0.02), AP (r=0.349, P=0.001) and cognitive performance (CP)(r=0.312, P=0.003) was observed. There was also a direct association of better jump tests with higher AP (r=0.328, P=0.002). Conclusion: The AP is associated with higher levels of fitness. Therefore, the education system should consider implementing curriculum strategies favouring the improvement of the PF, and therefore the health and AP of students.", "Macaques possess a repertoire of extractive foraging techniques that range from complex manipulation to tool-aided behaviors, to access food items that increase their foraging efficiency substantially. However, the complexity and composition of such techniques vary considerably between species and even between populations. In the present study, we report seven such complex manipulative behaviors that include six extractive foraging behaviors, and teeth flossing, in a population of Nicobar long-tailed macaques. The apparent purpose of these behaviors was an extraction of encased food, processing food, foraging hidden invertebrates, and dental flossing. Among these behaviors, three behaviors viz. wrapping, wiping, and teeth-flossing were tool-aided behaviors, where macaques used both natural and synthetic materials as tools. Occasionally macaques also modified those tools prior to their use. The substrate use patterns of leaf rubbing and teeth flossing were similar to that observed in other macaques. The spontaneous tool modification to perform wrapping was a first time observation. These observations suggest that Nicobar long-tailed macaques have a high level of sensorimotor intelligence which helps to evolve such innovative foraging solutions.", "Mental retardation (MR) is one of the most common cognitive comorbidities in children with tuberous sclerosis, and there are enormous studies about its risk factors. The genetic difference and the severity of epilepsy are the two main factors, but their weight in the occurrence of MR is still unclear. Two hundred twenty-three patients with tuberous sclerosis who received intelligence assessment, genetic mutation analysis, and the epilepsy severity assessment were included in our study. Genotype-neurocognitive phenotype correlations and epilepsy-neurocognitive phenotype correlations were analyzed by binary logistic regression analysis. No statistical significant result was found on genotype-neurocognitive phenotype correlations, which contrasted the previous report. The prevalence of MR was 50.0% for the patients with tuberous sclerosis complex-1 (TSC1) mutation, 54.5% for TSC2 (p=0.561), 54.7% for patients with protein-truncating (PT) and 50.0% for patients with nontruncating (NT) (p=0.791), and 54.3% for patients with family history and 53.7% for patients without family history (p=0.748). Statistical significant results were found on epilepsy-neurocognitive phenotype correlations, both on E-chess score (p=0.01) and the occurrence of infantile spasms (p=0.014), which was consistent to the previous study. For children with tuberous sclerosis, instead of genetic factors, epilepsy may play the main role for the presence of mental retardation. Patients with mental retardation tend to have earlier seizure attack, take more AEDs, have more seizure types, and have higher seizure frequency. Among the four cognitive functions in Denver II, social ability and language ability are more vulnerable to be influenced than fine and gross motor ability.", "In this study, we attempt to illustrate the competition that constitutes the main challenge of astrobiology, namely the competition between the probability of extraterrestrial life and its detectability. To illustrate this fact, we propose a simple statistical approach based on our knowledge of the Universe and the Milky Way, the Solar System, and the evolution of life on Earth permitting us to obtain the order of magnitude of the distance between Earth and bodies inhabited by more or less evolved past or present life forms, and the consequences of this probability for the detection of associated biosignatures. We thus show that the probability of the existence of evolved extraterrestrial forms of life increases with distance from the Earth while, at the same time, the number of detectable biosignatures decreases due to technical and physical limitations. This approach allows us to easily explain to the general public why it is very improbable to detect a signal of extraterrestrial intelligence while it is justified to launch space probes dedicated to the search for microbial life in the Solar System.", "Generative artificial intelligence models present a fresh approach to chemogenomics and de novo drug design, as they provide researchers with the ability to narrow down their search of the chemical space and focus on regions of interest. We present a method for molecular de novo design that utilizes generative recurrent neural networks (RNN) containing long short-term memory (LSTM) cells. This computational model captured the syntax of molecular representation in terms of SMILES strings with close to perfect accuracy. The learned pattern probabilities can be used for de novo SMILES generation. This molecular design concept eliminates the need for virtual compound library enumeration. By employing transfer learning, we fine-tuned the RNN's predictions for specific molecular targets. This approach enables virtual compound design without requiring secondary or external activity prediction, which could introduce error or unwanted bias. The results obtained advocate this generative RNN-LSTM system for high-impact use cases, such as low-data drug discovery, fragment based molecular design, and hit-to-lead optimization for diverse drug targets.", "Patients with third window syndrome and superior semicircular canal dehiscence (SSCD) symptoms whose surgical outcomes placed them as outliers were systematically studied to determine comorbidities that were responsible for their poor outcomes due to these confounding factors.\nObservational analytic case-control study in a tertiary referral center.\nTwelve adult patients with clinical SSCD syndrome underwent surgical management and had outcomes that did not resolve all of their subjective symptoms. In addition to one of the neurotologists, 2 neurologists (one specializing in migraine and the other a neuro-ophthalmologist), and a psychologist clinician-investigator completed comprehensive evaluations. Neuropsychology test batteries included: the Millon Behavioral Medicine Diagnostic; Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder Screener (GAD-7); Adverse Childhood Experiences Scale; the Wide Range Assessment of Memory and Learning, including the 3 domains of verbal memory, visual memory, and attention/concentration; Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale; and the Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System. The control cohort was comprised of 17 participants who previously underwent surgery for third window syndrome that resulted in the expected outcomes of resolution of their third window syndrome symptoms and cognitive dysfunction.\nThere was a high rate of psychological comorbidity (n\u2009=\u20096) in the outlier cohort; multiple traumatic brain injuries were also a confounding element (n\u2009=\u200910). One patient had elevated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure requiring ventriculoperitoneal shunting to control the recurrence of dehiscence and one patient with a drug-induced Parkinson-like syndrome and idiopathic progressive neurological degenerative process.\nComponents of the Millon Behavioral Medicine Diagnostic, PHQ-9 and GAD-7 results suggest that these instruments would be useful as screening tools preoperatively to identify psychological comorbidities that could confound outcomes. The identification of these comorbid psychological as well as other neurological degenerative disease processes led to alternate clinical management pathways for these patients.\n2b.", "Therapy dropout is a common occurrence, especially in adolescence. This study investigated whether dropout could be predicted from a range of child, family, and treatment factors in a sample of adolescents receiving therapy for depression.\nThis study draws on data from 406 participants of the IMPACT study, a randomized controlled trial, investigating three types of therapy in the treatment of adolescent depression. Logistic regression was used to estimate the effects of predictors on the odds of dropout.\nFew pre-treatment predictors of dropout were found, with the only significant predictors being older age, antisocial behaviour, and lower scores of verbal intelligence. Missed sessions and poorer therapeutic alliance early in treatment also predicted dropout. Most child and family factors investigated were not significantly associated with dropout.\nThere may be little about depressed adolescents' presentation prior to therapy starting that indicates their risk of dropout. However, within-treatment factors indicated that warning signs of dropout may be identifiable during the initial phase of therapy. Identifying and targeting early treatment indicators of dropout may provide possibilities for improving engagement. Clinical and methodological significance of this article: In the literature, a great deal of attention has been paid to child and family factors that predict therapy dropout, yet in this study, few pre-treatment characteristics were predictive of dropout. However, findings revealed possible warning signs of dropout in the early part of treatment, as poor therapeutic alliance and missed sessions were both found to be predictive of dropout. These findings call for therapists to be aware of such warning signs and clinical guidelines for managing cases at risk of dropout are warranted.", "A Japanese family with autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxia type 8 (SCAR8, MIM 610743) is described. We identified a novel SYNE1 frameshift deletion (c.6843del, p.Q2282Sfs*3). This family shared similar clinical manifestations characterized by adult-onset, relatively pure cerebellar ataxia with mild eye movement abnormality. Intelligence and bulbar and respiratory functions were unaffected. This study suggests the clinical utility of using panel-based exome sequencing for genetic diagnosis in hereditary ataxias in a cost-efficient manner.", "Recently published data support the use of a web-based risk calculator ( www.anastomoticleak.com ) for the prediction of anastomotic leak after colectomy. The aim of this study was to externally validate this calculator on a larger dataset.\nConsecutive adult patients undergoing elective or emergency colectomy for colon cancer at a single institution over a 9-year period were identified using the Binational Colorectal Cancer Audit database. Patients with a rectosigmoid cancer, an R2 resection, or a diverting ostomy were excluded. The primary outcome was anastomotic leak within 90\u00a0days as defined by previously published criteria. Area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) was derived and compared with that of the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program\u00ae (ACS NSQIP) calculator and the colon leakage score (CLS) calculator for left colectomy. Commercially available artificial intelligence-based analytics software was used to further interrogate the prediction algorithm.\nA total of 626 patients were identified. Four hundred and fifty-six patients met the inclusion criteria, and 402 had complete data available for all the calculator variables (126 had a left colectomy). Laparoscopic surgery was performed in 39.6% and emergency surgery in 14.7%. The anastomotic leak rate was 7.2%, with 31.0% requiring reoperation. The anastomoticleak.com calculator was significantly predictive of leak and performed better than the ACS NSQIP calculator (AUROC 0.73 vs 0.58) and the CLS calculator (AUROC 0.96 vs 0.80) for left colectomy. Artificial intelligence-predictive analysis supported these findings and identified an improved prediction model.\nThe anastomotic leak risk calculator is significantly predictive of anastomotic leak after colon cancer resection. Wider investigation of artificial intelligence-based analytics for risk prediction is warranted.", "We compared the importance of socio-demographic, lifestyle, health, and multiple cognitive measures for predicting individual differences in depressive symptoms in later adulthood.\nData came from 6203 community-dwelling older adults (age 41-93\u00a0years at study entry) from the United Kingdom. Predictors (36 in total) were assessed up to four times across a period of approximately 12\u00a0years. Depressive symptoms were measured with the Geriatric Depression Scale. Statistical methods included multiple imputation (for missing data), random forest analysis (a machine learning approach), and multivariate regression.\nOn average, depressive symptoms increased gradually following middle age and appeared to accelerate in later life. Individual differences in depressive symptoms were most strongly associated with differences in combined symptoms of physical illness (positive relation) and fluid intelligence (negative relation). The strength of association between depressive symptoms and fluid intelligence was unaffected by differences in health status within a subsample of chronically depressed individuals.\nJoint consideration of general health status and fluid intelligence may facilitate prediction of depressive symptoms severity during later life and may also serve to identify sub-populations of community-dwelling elders at risk for chronic depression.", "Positive emotional perceptions and healthy emotional intelligence (EI) are important for social functioning. In this study, we investigated whether loving kindness meditation (LKM) combined with anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) would facilitate improvements in EI and changes in affective experience of visual stimuli. LKM has been shown to increase positive emotional experiences and we hypothesized that tDCS could enhance these effects. Eighty-seven undergraduates were randomly assigned to 30\u00a0minutes of LKM or a relaxation control recording with anodal tDCS applied to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (left dlPFC) or right temporoparietal junction (right TPJ) at 0.1 or 2.0 milliamps. The primary outcomes were self-reported affect ratings of images from the International Affective Picture System and EI as measured by the Mayer, Salovey and Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test. Results indicated no effects of training on EI, and no main effects of LKM, electrode placement, or tDCS current strength on affect ratings. There was a significant interaction of electrode placement by meditation condition (p\u00a0=\u00a00.001), such that those assigned to LKM and right TPJ tDCS, regardless of current strength, rated neutral and positive images more positively after training. Results suggest that LKM may enhance positive affective experience.", "The Northwestern University SuperAging Program studies a rare cohort of individuals over age 80 with episodic memory ability at least as good as middle-age adults to determine what factors contribute to their elite memory performance. As psychological well-being is positively correlated with cognitive performance in older adults, the present study examined whether aspects of psychological well-being distinguish cognitive SuperAgers from their cognitively average-for-age, same-age peers.\nThirty-one SuperAgers and 19 cognitively average-for-age peers completed the Ryff 42-item Psychological Well-Being questionnaire, comprised of 6 subscales: Autonomy, Positive Relations with Others, Environmental Mastery, Personal Growth, Purpose in Life, and Self-Acceptance.\nThe groups did not differ on demographic factors, including estimated premorbid intelligence. Consistent with inclusion criteria, SuperAgers had better episodic memory scores. Compared to cognitively average-for-age peers, SuperAgers endorsed greater levels of Positive Relations with Others. The groups did not differ on other PWB-42 subscales.\nWhile SuperAgers and their cognitively average-for-age peers reported similarly high levels of psychological well-being across multiple dimensions, SuperAgers endorsed greater levels of positive social relationships. This psychological feature could conceivably have a biological relationship to the greater thickness of the anterior cingulate gyrus and higher density of von Economo neurons previously reported in SuperAgers.", "Drug-resistant infections caused by bacteria with increasing antimicrobial resistance (AMR) threaten our ability to treat life-threatening conditions. Tackling AMR requires international collaboration and partnership. An early and leading priority to do this is to strengthen AMR surveillance, particularly in low-income countries where the burden of infectious diseases is highest and where data are most limited. The World Health Organization (WHO) has developed the Global AMR Surveillance System (GLASS) as one of a number of measures designed to tackle the problem of AMR, and WHO member states have been encouraged to produce National Action Plans for AMR by 2017. However, low-income countries are unlikely to have the resources or capacity to implement all the components in the GLASS manual. To facilitate their efforts, we developed a guideline that is aligned to the GLASS procedures, but written specifically for implementation in low-income countries. The guideline allows for flexibility across different systems, but has sufficient standardisation of core protocols to ensure that, if followed, data will be valid and comparable. This will ensure that the surveillance programme can provide health intelligence data to inform evidence-based interventions at local, national and international levels.", "Resilience factors and their relation to emotional intelligence (EI) as a potential strength for children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or high-functioning autism spectrum disorder (HFASD) were investigated. Children with either ADHD or HFASD were hypothesized to demonstrate reduced EI and differential relations between EI and resilience as compared to typically developing (TD) children.\nFifty-four children aged 8-12\u00a0years (18 with ADHD, 18 with HFASD, and 18 TD controls) completed the Resilience Scales for Children and Adolescents and BarOn Emotional Quotient Inventory. Differences between groups (analysis of variance) and unique relations among the variables (correlation) for each group were examined.\nNo group differences; however, unique relations between the variables were found within each sample.\nEI may be a unique area of interest for clinical populations and an important consideration in the development and implementation of interventions to capitalize upon inherent strengths. Implications of these results for intervention are discussed.", "In judging normalcy, surgeons rely on established facial anthropometric measures and proportions. However, there exists a range of \"normal,\" and a degree of disproportion may be considered more attractive. The authors set out to determine how changes in only intercanthal distance affect the layperson's perception of beauty and personality traits of a face. The authors used Amazon.com's Mechanical Turk (MTurk), a crowdsourcing tool, to determine how changes in intercanthal distance affect overall perception of beauty and personality. MTurk respondents provided demographic information and were asked to survey 16 female subjects, each digitally edited to be hypoteloric or hyperteloric. Data were collected from 490 MTurk crowd raters. Paired t test analysis found that respondents perceived subjects to be more submissive, friendly, and attractive with increased intercanthal distance (P < 0.05). Women respondents were less likely to perceive change in regards to how unthreatening and how intelligent the subject appeared upon intercanthal widening (P < 0.05). Compared with Caucasian respondents, minorities (Asian- and African-American) were more likely to perceive difference in submissiveness, threat, intelligence, and attractiveness with increased intercanthal distance (P < 0.05). All respondents >46 years of age were less likely to perceive a change in any of the 7 traits upon intercanthal widening, compared with respondents between 18 and 25 years of age (P < 0.05). The layperson perceives significant increases in a female subject's submissivness, friendliness, and attractiveness with an intercanthal distance increase of 10% from normal. Surgeons should be aware of this when correcting hypertelorism, given the potential positive impact of a slightly increased intercanthal distance on perceived beauty and personality.", "Determination of above ground biomass (AGB) of any forest is a longstanding scientific endeavor, which helps to estimate net primary productivity, carbon stock and other biophysical parameters of that forest. With advancement of geospatial technology in last few decades, AGB estimation now can be done using space-borne and airborne remotely sensed data. It is a well-established, time saving and cost effective technique with high precision and is frequently applied by the scientific community. It involves development of allometric equations based on correlations of ground-based forest biomass measurements with vegetation indices derived from remotely sensed data. However, selection of the best-fit and explanatory models of biomass estimation often becomes a difficult proposition with respect to the image data resolution (spatial and spectral) as well as the sensor platform position in space. Using Resourcesat-2 satellite data and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), this pilot scale study compared traditional linear and nonlinear models with an artificial intelligence-based non-parametric technique, i.e. artificial neural network (ANN) for formulation of the best-fit model to determine AGB of forest of the Bundelkhand region of India. The results confirmed the superiority of ANN over other models in terms of several statistical significance and reliability assessment measures. Accordingly, this study proposed the use of ANN instead of traditional models for determination of AGB and other bio-physical parameters of any dry deciduous forest of tropical sub-humid or semi-arid area. In addition, large numbers of sampling sites with different quadrant sizes for trees, shrubs, and herbs as well as application of LiDAR data as predictor variable were recommended for very high precision modelling in ANN for a large scale study.", "The purpose of this study was to investigate the existence and extent of cognitive impairment in adult diabetes mellitus (DM) patients with episodes of recurrent severe hypoglycemia, by using meta-analysis to synthesize data across studies. PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane library search engines were used to identify studies on cognitive performance in DM patients with recurrent severe hypoglycemia. Random-effects meta-analysis was performed on seven eligible studies using an inverse-variance method. Effect sizes, which are the standardized differences between the experimental group and the control group, were calculated. Of the 853 studies, 7 studies met the inclusion criteria. Compared with control subjects, the adult DM patients with episodes of recurrent severe hypoglycemia demonstrated a significantly lowered performance on memory in both types of DM patients, and poor performance of processing speed in type 2 DM patients. There was no significant difference between adult DM patients with and those without severe hypoglycemia in other cognitive domains such as general intelligence, executive function, processing speed and psychomotor efficiency. Our results seem to confirm the hypothesis that cognitive dysfunction is characterized by worse memory and processing speed in adult DM patients with a history of recurrent severe hypoglycemia, whereas general intelligence, executive function, and psychomotor efficiency are spared.", "This study aimed to evaluate the effect of the Intensive Program of Emotional Intelligence (IPEI; Fern&aacute;ndez, 2016; F&eacute;rreo, 2016) on middle managers&rsquo; emotional intelligence, as this variable may have a significant impact on personal satisfaction, task performance, and the work environment.\nThe intervention was applied to work team supervisors in a large call center, as it is an overlooked sector in this topic. Two-hundred and eighty-two supervisors from a Madrid-based, Spanish multinational (51.4% men and 48.6% women) participated in this study. Participants were assigned to the experimental group (n = 190) or the control group (n = 92) by availability, according to management decision. All supervisors filled in two questionnaires to evaluate the different components of intrapersonal emotional intelligence (i.e., attention, clarity, and repair; TMMS-24; Fern&aacute;ndez-Berrocal, Extremera, &amp; Ramos, 2004) and cognitive and affective empathy (i.e., perspective taking, emotion understanding, empathic joy, and personal distress; TECA; L&oacute;pez-P&eacute;rez, Fern&aacute;ndez, &amp; Abad, 2008).\nThe findings showed an increase in the studied variables for the experimental group.\nThe results obtained support middle managers&rsquo; training in emotional competences through short, efficient, economic programs. Potential limitations and implications of the results are discussed.", "Behaviour change is key to addressing both the challenges facing human health and wellbeing and to promoting the uptake of research findings in health policy and practice. We need to make better use of the vast amount of accumulating evidence from behaviour change intervention (BCI) evaluations and promote the uptake of that evidence into a wide range of contexts. The scale and complexity of the task of synthesising and interpreting this evidence, and increasing evidence timeliness and accessibility, will require increased computer support. The Human Behaviour-Change Project (HBCP) will use Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning to (i) develop and evaluate a 'Knowledge System' that automatically extracts, synthesises and interprets findings from BCI evaluation reports to generate new insights about behaviour change and improve prediction of intervention effectiveness and (ii) allow users, such as practitioners, policy makers and researchers, to easily and efficiently query the system to get answers to variants of the question 'What works, compared with what, how well, with what exposure, with what behaviours (for how long), for whom, in what settings and why?'.\nThe HBCP will: a) develop an ontology of BCI evaluations and their reports linking effect sizes for given target behaviours with intervention content and delivery and mechanisms of action, as moderated by exposure, populations and settings; b) develop and train an automated feature extraction system to annotate BCI evaluation reports using this ontology; c) develop and train machine learning and reasoning algorithms to use the annotated BCI evaluation reports to predict effect sizes for particular combinations of behaviours, interventions, populations and settings; d) build user and machine interfaces for interrogating and updating the knowledge base; and e) evaluate all the above in terms of performance and utility.\nThe HBCP aims to revolutionise our ability to synthesise, interpret and deliver evidence on behaviour change interventions that is up-to-date and tailored to user need and context. This will enhance the usefulness, and support the implementation of, that evidence.", "Male breast cancer (MBC) accounts for 1% of all breast cancer. Adult obesity and tallness are risk factors for MBC, but the role of adolescent fatness is largely unknown. We aimed to assess the association between body mass index (BMI) in adolescence and the incidence of MBC in a large cohort of 16- to 19-year-old Israeli males. 1,382,093 Jewish Israeli males aged 16-19 who underwent anthropometric measurements, a general intelligence test (GIT) and other examinations during 1967-2011, were followed up to December 31, 2012 for MBC incidence. Cox proportional hazards models assessed the association between adolescent BMI (as WHO BMI categories and as age-specific CDC percentiles) and time to MBC diagnosis, adjusting for sociodemographic covariates. Of 100 MBC cases diagnosed during 29,386,233 person-years of follow-up, 97 were included in multivariable analyses. Compared to \"healthy\" BMI (18.5-24.9 kg/m2 ) and adjusted for year of birth, country of origin and GIT score, higher adolescent BMI was associated with higher MBC risk: hazard ratio (HR)\u2009=\u20092.01 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.14-3.55, p\u2009=\u20090.015) in overweight (25.0\u2009\u2264\u2009BMI\u2009<\u200930.0 kg/m2 ) adolescents; and HR\u2009=\u20094.97 (95%CI 2.14-11.53, p\u2009=\u20090.0002) in obese (BMI\u2009\u2265\u200930.0 kg/m2 ) adolescents. When CDC age-specific BMI percentiles were assessed results were similar and statistically significant for obesity. In addition, low (vs. high) GIT score (HR\u2009=\u20094.76, 95%CI 1.96-12.50, p\u2009=\u20090.001) and European (vs. west-Asian) origin (HR\u2009=\u20091.99, 95%CI 1.19-3.34, p\u2009=\u20090.009) were independent predictors of MBC. Measured adolescent overweight and obesity are associated with increased risk of MBC, suggesting a modifiable risk factor potentially allowing for early intervention. The novel association with cognitive function should be further explored.", "This study aimed to investigate if ellagic acid has beneficial effects on cognitive deficits in middle-aged overweight individuals and to propose a possible mechanism. A total of 150 middle-aged male participants, including 76 normal-weight and 74 overweight men, aged between 45 to 55 years, were recruited for this study. Both normal-weight and overweight participants were administered either 50 mg ellagic acid or placebo cellulose daily for 12 weeks. Blood lipids, peripheral brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and saliva cortisol were assessed on the last day of the procedure to investigate the effects induced by ellagic acid. The results revealed that ellagic acid treatment improved the levels of blood lipid metabolism with a 4.7% decline in total cholesterol, 7.3% decline in triglycerides, 26.5% increase in high-density lipoprotein, and 6.5% decline in low-density lipoprotein. Additionally, ellagic acid increased plasma BDNF by 21.2% in the overweight group and showed no effects on normal-weight participants. Moreover, the increased saliva cortisol level in overweight individuals was inhibited by 22.7% in a 12-week ellagic acid treatment. Also, compared with placebo, overweight individuals who consumed ellagic acid showed enhanced cognitive function as measured by the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report showing that ellagic acid prevents cognitive deficits through normalization of lipid metabolism, increase in plasma BDNF level, and reduction of saliva cortisol concentration. These results indicate that ellagic acid has a potential to restore cognitive performance related to mild age-related declines.", "Tuberculosis (TB) remains one of the most devastating infectious diseases and its treatment efficiency is majorly influenced by the stage at which infection with the TB bacterium is diagnosed. The available methods for TB diagnosis are either time consuming, costly or not efficient. This study employs a signal generation mechanism for biosensing, known as Plasmonic ELISA, and computational intelligence to facilitate automatic diagnosis of TB. Plasmonic ELISA enables the detection of a few molecules of analyte by the incorporation of smart nanomaterials for better sensitivity of the developed detection system. The computational system uses k-means clustering and thresholding for image segmentation. This paper presents the results of the classification performance of the Plasmonic ELISA imaging data by using various types of classifiers. The five-fold cross-validation results show high accuracy rate (>97%) in classifying TB images using the entire data set. Future work will focus on developing an intelligent mobile-enabled expert system to diagnose TB in real-time. The intelligent system will be clinically validated and tested in collaboration with healthcare providers in Malaysia.", "The diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is purely dependent on counting the percentages of blasts (>20%) in the peripheral blood or bone marrow. Manual microscopic examination of peripheral blood or bone marrow aspirate smears is time consuming and less accurate. The first and very important step in blast recognition is the segmentation of the cells from the background for further cell feature extraction and cell classification. In this paper, we aimed to utilize computer technologies in image analysis and artificial intelligence to develop an automatic program for blast recognition and counting in the aspirate smears.\nWe proposed a method to analyze the aspirate smear images, which first performs segmentation of the cells by k-means cluster, then builds cell image representing model by HMRF (Hidden-Markov Random Field), estimates model parameters through probability of EM (expectation maximization), carries out convergence iteration until optimal value, and finally achieves second stage refined segmentation. Furthermore, the segmentation results are compared with several other methods using six classes of cells respectively.\nThe proposed method was applied to six groups of cells from 61 bone marrow aspirate images, and compared with other algorithms for its performance on the analysis of the whole images, the segmentation of nucleus, and the efficiency of calculation. It showed improved segmentation results in both the cropped images and the whole images, which provide the base for down-stream cell feature extraction and identification.\nSegmentation of the aspirate smear images using the proposed method helps the analyst in differentiating six groups of cells and in the determination of blasts counting, which will be of great significance for the diagnosis of acute\u00a0myeloid\u00a0leukemia.", "Premature infants are exposed to high levels of noise in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).\nThis study evaluated the effect of a relaxing music therapy intervention composed by artificial intelligence on respiratory rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and heart rate.\nA double-blind, randomized, controlled trial was conducted in the NICUs of 2 general public hospitals in Andalusia, Spain. Participants were 17 healthy premature infants, randomly allocated to the intervention group or the control group (silence) at a 1:1 ratio. To be included in the study, the subjects were to be 32 to 36 weeks of gestation at birth (M= 32.33; SD = 1.79) and passed a hearing screening test satisfactorily. The intervention lasted 20 minutes, 3 times a day for 3 consecutive days, while infants were in the incubator. Infants' heart rate, respiratory rate, and blood pressure were assessed before and after each intervention session.\nAfter each session, the respiratory rate decreased in the experimental group (main between-groups effect (F1,13 = 6.73, P = .022, \u03b7partial = 0.34). Across the sessions, the heart rate increased in the control group (main between-groups effect, F1,11 = 5.09, P = .045, \u03b7partial = 0.32).\nFuture studies can use this music intervention to assess its potential effects in premature infants.\nNurses can apply the relaxing music intervention presented in this study to ameliorate the impact of the stressful environment on premature infants.", "In general, academic but not community endoscopists have demonstrated adequate endoscopic differentiation accuracy to make the 'resect and discard' paradigm for diminutive colorectal polyps workable. Computer analysis of video could potentially eliminate the obstacle of interobserver variability in endoscopic polyp interpretation and enable widespread acceptance of 'resect and discard'.\nWe developed an artificial intelligence (AI) model for real-time assessment of endoscopic video images of colorectal polyps. A deep convolutional neural network model was used. Only narrow band imaging video frames were used, split equally between relevant multiclasses. Unaltered videos from routine exams not specifically designed or adapted for AI classification were used to train and validate the model. The model was tested on a separate series of 125 videos of consecutively encountered diminutive polyps that were proven to be adenomas or hyperplastic polyps.\nThe AI model works with a confidence mechanism and did not generate sufficient confidence to predict the histology of 19 polyps in the test set, representing 15% of the polyps. For the remaining 106 diminutive polyps, the accuracy of the model was 94% (95% CI 86% to 97%), the sensitivity for identification of adenomas was 98% (95% CI 92% to 100%), specificity was 83% (95% CI 67% to 93%), negative predictive value 97% and positive predictive value 90%.\nAn AI model trained on endoscopic video can differentiate diminutive adenomas from hyperplastic polyps with high accuracy. Additional study of this programme in a live patient clinical trial setting to address resect and discard is planned.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) is the development of computer systems which are capable of doing human intelligence tasks such as decision making and problem solving. AI-based tools have been used for predicting various factors in medicine including risk stratification, diagnosis and choice of treatment. AI can also be of considerable help in emergency departments, especially patients' triage.\nThis study was undertaken to evaluate the application of AI in patients presenting with acute abdominal pain to estimate emergency severity index version 4 (ESI-4) score without the estimate of the required resources.\nA mixed-model approach was used for predicting the ESI-4 score. Seventy percent of the patient cases were used for training the models and the remaining 30% for testing the accuracy of the models. During the training phase, patients were randomly selected and were given to systems for analysis. The output, which was the level of triage, was compared with the gold standard (emergency medicine physician). During the test phase of the study, another group of randomly selected patients were evaluated by the systems and the results were then compared with the gold standard.\nTotally, 215 patients who were triaged by the emergency medicine specialist were enrolled in the study. Triage Levels 1 and 5 were omitted due to low number of cases. In triage Level 2, all systems showed fair level of prediction with Neural Network being the highest. In Level 3, all systems again showed fair level of prediction. However, in triage Level 4, decision tree was the only system with fair prediction.\nThe application of AI in triage of patients with acute abdominal pain resulted in a model with acceptable level of accuracy. The model works with optimized number of input variables for quick assessment.", "To screen fatty acid oxidation disorders (FAOD) in newborns in Zhejiang province.\nA total of 1 861 262 newborns were screened for FAOD in Neonatal Screening Center of Zhejiang Province during January 2009 and December 2016. The blood samples from newborns were screened by tandem mass spectrometry, and diagnosis of FAOD was confirmed by urine organic acid measurement combined with genetic analysis. The prognosis and follow-up of patients with FAOD were also evaluated.\nOf 1 861 262 newborns screened, 121 cases of FAOD were diagnosed. Among 121 cases of FAOD, primary carnitine deficiency (PCD) was the most common type (n=78, 64.5%), which was followed by short-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (SCADD, n=27, 22.3%), medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (n=5, 4.1%), multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MADD, n=4, 3.3%), very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (n=3, 2.5%), carnitine palmitoyltransferase \u2160 deficiency(n=2, 1.7%)and carnitine palmitoyltransferase \u2161 deficiency (CPT\u2161D, n=2, 1.7%). During 2-82 month follow-up, 15 patients were lost, 4 were dead (1 PCD, 1 MADD, and 2 CPT\u2161D), and the remaining 102 subjects had normal intelligence and physical development without any clinical symptoms.\nPCD and SCADD are the most common FAODs in newborns in Zhejiang province.

Our first step is to provide foundations for modelling of emergent and evolving dynamic multi-level organic complexes and their sustentative processes in artificial and natural life systems. Main applications are in life sciences, medicine, ecology and astrobiology, as well as robotics, industrial automation, man-machine interface and creative design. Since 2011 over 100 scientists from a number of disciplines have been exploring a substantial set of theoretical frameworks for a comprehensive theory of life known as Integral Biomathics. That effort identified the need for a robust core model of organisms as dynamic wholes, using advanced and adequately computable mathematics. The work described here for that core combines the advantages of a situation and context aware multivalent computational logic for active self-organizing networks, Wandering Logic Intelligence (WLI), and a multi-scale dynamic category theory, Memory Evolutive Systems (MES), hence WLIMES. This is presented to the modeller via a formal augmented reality language as a first step towards practical modelling and simulation of multi-level living systems. Initial work focuses on the design and implementation of this visual language and calculus (VLC) and its graphical user interface. The results will be integrated within the current methodology and practices of theoretical biology and (personalized) medicine to deepen and to enhance the holistic understanding of life.", "The main goal of this work is the development of models, based on computational intelligence techniques, in particular neural networks, to predict the maximum oxygen consumption value. While the maximum oxygen consumption is a direct mark of the cardiorespiratory fitness, several studies have also confirmed it also as a powerful predictor of risk for adverse outcomes, such as hypertension, obesity, and diabetes. Therefore, the existence of simpler and accurate models, establishing an alternative to standard cardiopulmonary exercise tests, with the potential to be employed in the stratification of the general population in daily clinical practice, would be of major importance. In the current study, different models were implemented and compared: 1) the traditional Wasserman/Hansen equation; 2) linear regression and; 3) non-linear neural networks. Their performance was evaluated based on the \"FRIEND - Fitness Registry and the Importance of Exercise: The National Data Base\" [1] being, in the present study, a subset of 12262 individuals employed. The accuracy of the models was performed through the computation of sensitivity and specificity values. The results show the superiority of neural networks in the prediction of maximum oxygen consumption.", "Studies on emotional intelligence show that some of its dimensions are related to psychological adjustment and the quality of interpersonal relationships. Besides face-to-face interaction, nowadays, relationships are also initiated and maintained in cyberspace. Some studies suggest that emotional content is present in cyber-behavior. The objective of this study was to reveal whether emotions are expressed, perceived and managed online &ndash; a concept called E-motions, and to validate an instrument to measure this concept.\nThe E-motions Questionnaire was designed and together with other instruments, completed by 612 university students. Then, the questionnaire was completed by a representative sample of 2139 students in compulsory secondary education in 22 schools in all Andalusian provinces. The first sample was used for exploratory factor analysis and the second sample for confirmatory factor analysis.\nThe E-motions Questionnaire was validated with good psychometric properties. Four factors were found showing that emotions are perceived, expressed, used, understood and managed online. This behavior is related to some aspects of emotional intelligence and also to difficulties in identifying feelings.\nThis new promising research field could be useful for further advancement of research into cyber-behavior.", "Ample evidence supports a neurodevelopmental origin in some cases of schizophrenia (SZ). More inconsistent information is available for bipolar disorder (BD). We herein review studies with a focus on premorbid (adjustment and functionality) and early developmental milestones that include both SZ and BD patients. A search was performed in the PubMed electronic database, retrieving 619 abstracts; 30 were ultimately included in this systematic review. Eight prospective cohorts, 15 retrospective studies, and 7 studies based on national registries. Psychomotor developmental deviations and general adjustment problems characterize the childhood of subjects later diagnosed with SZ or BD; they are more marked in those later diagnosed with SZ vs BD, earlier onset vs later onset, and psychotic vs nonpsychotic disorders. Cognitive impairment follows a linear risk trend for SZ and a U-shaped trend for BD. Social isolation and visuoperceptual/reading anomalies more frequently antecede SZ. Pervasive developmental disorders increase the risk for both SZ and BD, more so in cases with normal intelligence. The predictive risk of each isolated developmental marker is low, but a significant percentage of subjects with SZ and a minority of adults with BD showed signs of premorbid abnormalities in childhood. The great limitation is still the lack of studies comparing SZ and BD that include psychotic and nonpsychotic bipolar cases separately. There are many cases, even in childhood/adolescent SZ, where no premorbid anomalies are found, and immunological disorders or other etiologies should be searched for. At least in cases with clear neurodevelopmental markers, rare genetic variants should be investigated.", "A long-standing goal of artificial intelligence is an algorithm that learns, tabula rasa, superhuman proficiency in challenging domains. Recently, AlphaGo became the first program to defeat a world champion in the game of Go. The tree search in AlphaGo evaluated positions and selected moves using deep neural networks. These neural networks were trained by supervised learning from human expert moves, and by reinforcement learning from self-play. Here we introduce an algorithm based solely on reinforcement learning, without human data, guidance or domain knowledge beyond game rules. AlphaGo becomes its own teacher: a neural network is trained to predict AlphaGo's own move selections and also the winner of AlphaGo's games. This neural network improves the strength of the tree search, resulting in higher quality move selection and stronger self-play in the next iteration. Starting tabula rasa, our new program AlphaGo Zero achieved superhuman performance, winning 100-0 against the previously published, champion-defeating AlphaGo.", "Emotional intelligence (EI) is regarded an important factor related to psychiatric disorder. Most of previous studies of EI and depression only dealt with EI in present of depressive symptoms. Our study investigated EI both before and after remission of depression and to identify which component of EI is changeable by depression condition.\nEI was evaluated for 23 depression patients and 44 normal control participants. Adult Emotional Quotient Test (AEQT) was used as subjective EI measure and Emotional Literacy Test (ELT) was used as objective EI measure to both groups.\nDuring the initial evaluation of the subjective EI, patient group reported significantly lower scores than control group on all AEQT sub-domains except 'empathy'. However, group difference on 'utilization' disappeared after the remission evaluation. There was no significant difference within the objective EI measure.\nAccording to the result of the study, EI could be sub-divided into trait-dependent EI and state-dependent EI. Further implication, strength and limitation were discussed.", "Artificial intelligence (AI), a computer system aiming to mimic human intelligence, is gaining increasing interest and is being incorporated into many fields, including medicine. Stroke medicine is one such area of application of AI, for improving the accuracy of diagnosis and the quality of patient care. For stroke management, adequate analysis of stroke imaging is crucial. Recently, AI techniques have been applied to decipher the data from stroke imaging and have demonstrated some promising results. In the very near future, such AI techniques may play a pivotal role in determining the therapeutic methods and predicting the prognosis for stroke patients in an individualized manner. In this review, we offer a glimpse at the use of AI in stroke imaging, specifically focusing on its technical principles, clinical application, and future perspectives.", "To extend previous work and estimate health and social care costs, litigation costs, funeral-related costs, and productivity losses associated with stillbirth in the UK.\nA population-based cost-of-illness study using a synthesis of secondary data.\nThe National Health Service (NHS) and wider society in the UK.\nStillbirths occurring within a 12-month period and subsequent events occurring over the following 2\u00a0years.\nCosts were estimated using published data on events, resource use, and unit costs.\nMean health and social care costs, litigation costs, funeral-related costs, and productivity costs for 2\u00a0years, reported for a single stillbirth and at a national level.\nMean health and social care costs per stillbirth were \u00a34191. Additionally, funeral-related costs were \u00a3559, and workplace absence (parents and healthcare professionals) was estimated to cost \u00a33829 per stillbirth. For the UK, the annual health and social care costs were estimated at \u00a313.6\u00a0million, and total productivity losses amounted to \u00a3706.1\u00a0million (98% of this cost was attributable to the loss of the life of the baby).\u00a0The figures for total productivity losses were sensitive to\u00a0the perspective adopted about the loss of life of the baby.\nThis work expands the current intelligence on the costs of stillbirth beyond the health service to costs for parents\u00a0and society, and yet these additional findings must still be regarded as conservative estimates of the true economic costs.\nThe costs of stillbirth are significant, affecting the health service, parents, professionals, and society.\nWhy and how was the study carried out? The personal, social, and emotional consequences of stillbirth are profound. Placing a monetary value on such consequences is emotive, yet necessary, when deciding how best to invest limited healthcare resources. We estimated the average costs associated with a single stillbirth and the costs for all stillbirths occurring in the UK over a 1-year period. What were the main findings? The average cost to the National Health Service (NHS) of care related to the stillbirth and a first subsequent pregnancy was \u00a34191 for each stillbirth. For the UK, this cost was \u00a313.6\u00a0million annually. Clinical negligence payments to bereaved parents were estimated at \u00a32.5\u00a0million per year. Parents were estimated to spend \u00a31.8\u00a0million per year on funerals. The cost of workplace absence as parents cope with the effects of grief was estimated at \u00a32476 per stillbirth. For the UK, this cost was \u00a38.1\u00a0million annually. The loss of a baby is also the loss of an individual with the potential to become a valued and productive member of society. The expected value of an adult's lifetime working hours was taken as an estimate of this productivity loss, and was \u00a3213,304 for each stillbirth. The annual cost for all stillbirths was \u00a3694\u00a0million. We know from parents that the birth of a subsequent child in no way replaces a stillborn baby. We found that 52% of women fall pregnant within 12\u00a0months of a stillbirth. From a purely economic perspective concerned only with the number of individuals in society, babies born during this period could potentially replace the productivity losses of the stillborn baby. Adopting this approach, which we understand is controversial and difficult for bereaved parents, the expected productivity losses would be lower, at \u00a3333\u00a0million. What are the limitations of the work? For some categories, existing data were unavailable and we used clinical opinion to estimate costs. Furthermore, we were unable to quantify some indirect consequences, for example the psychological distress experienced by wider family members. What is the implication for parents? Placing a monetary value on what is for parents a profound personal tragedy may seem unkind. It is, however, unavoidable if we are to provide policy makers with vital information on the wide-ranging consequences that could be prevented through future investments in initiatives to reduce stillbirth.", "The aim of the study was to investigate the perception of the family functioning in parents of children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) with normal-range intelligence and the relationships between family functioning, parenting stress and quality of life. Dyads of parents of children with ASD without intellectual disability and parents of typically developing children (controls) completed a set of self-report questionnaires. Parents of children with ASD reported lower functioning of the family as a whole and their own functioning as family members; they exhibited higher levels of parenting stress and lower quality of life. Mothers of children with ASD experienced more stress in personal domain than fathers. Relationships between family functioning, parenting stress and quality of life have been established. There were also moderate to strong correlations in mother-father dyads between their assessments of family functioning, parenting stress and QoL in social relationships and environmental domains.", "BackgroundHigh intelligence may be associated with positive (adaptive, desired) outcomes, but may also come with disadvantages.AimsTo contribute empirically to the debate concerning whether a trade-off in IQ scores exists in relation to attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and related problems, suggesting that high intelligence - like low intelligence - increases the risk of ADHD.MethodCurves of the relation between IQ score and ADHD problems were fitted to questionnaire data (parent, teacher, self-report} in a population-based study of 2221 children and adolescents aged 10-12 years. Externalising and internalising problems were included for comparison purposes.ResultsHigher IQ score was most strongly related to fewer attention problems, with more rater discrepancy in the high v. average IQ range. Attention problems - but only minimally hyperactivity/impulsivity problems - predicted functional impairment at school, also in the higher IQ range.ConclusionsAttention problems in highly intelligent children are exceptional and affect school performance; they are therefore a reason for clinical concern.", "Patients with mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS) have a plethora of multisystemic manifestations depending on the particular type, and atypical presentations are not uncommon. MPS type IVA (Morquio A syndrome) has predominant musculoskeletal system involvement and corneal clouding with normal intelligence and can be misdiagnosed as primary skeletal disorders in clinical practice. The absence of corneal clouding with normal urinary glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) level in a proportion of patients with MPS IVA makes the correct diagnosis even more challenging for physicians. Healthcare providers across specialties should have a high degree of suspicion for MPS IVA in all patients with suspected spondylo-epiphyseal dysplasia as early diagnosis and early treatment significantly improve the clinical outcome and activity of daily living.", "The smart information management system (SIMS) is concerned with the organization of anonymous patient records in a big data and their extraction in order to provide needful real-time intelligence.

The SIMS in the health big data aims the identification of new therapies and approaches to delivering care.", "Healthcare reform typically involves orchestrating a policy change, mediated through some form of operational, systems, financial, process or practice intervention. The aim is to improve the ways in which care is delivered to patients. In our book 'Health Systems Improvement Across the Globe: Success Stories from 60 Countries', we gathered case-study accomplishments from 60 countries. A unique feature of the collection is the diversity of included countries, from the wealthiest and most politically stable such as Japan, Qatar and Canada, to some of the poorest, most densely populated or politically challenged, including Afghanistan, Guinea and Nigeria. Despite constraints faced by health reformers everywhere, every country was able to share a story of accomplishment-defining how their case example was managed, what services were affected and ultimately how patients, staff, or the system overall, benefited. The reform themes ranged from those relating to policy, care coverage and governance; to quality, standards, accreditation and regulation; to the organization of care; to safety, workforce and resources; to technology and IT; through to practical ways in which stakeholders forged collaborations and partnerships to achieve mutual aims. Common factors linked to success included the 'acorn-to-oak tree' principle (a small scale initiative can lead to system-wide reforms); the 'data-to-information-to-intelligence' principle (the role of IT and data are becoming more critical for delivering efficient and appropriate care, but must be converted into useful intelligence); the 'many-hands' principle (concerted action between stakeholders is key); and the 'patient-as-the-pre-eminent-player' principle (placing patients at the centre of reform designs is critical for success).", "Other than cognitive ability, what competencies should schools promote in children? How are they organized, and to what extent do they predict consequential outcomes? Separate theoretical traditions have suggested interpersonal, intrapersonal, and intellectual dimensions, reflecting how children relate to other people, manage their own goals and impulses, and engage with ideas, respectively. However, very little work has examined character empirically. In the current investigation, we partnered with middle schools that had previously identified character strengths relevant in their communities. Across three longitudinal, prospective studies, we examined the factor structure of character, associations with intelligence and Big Five personality traits, and predictive validity for consequential outcomes like peer relations, class participation, and report card grades. In Study 1, teachers rated their students on behaviors exemplifying character strengths as they played out in students' daily lives. Exploratory factor analyses yielded a three-factor structure consisting of interpersonal (interpersonal self-control, gratitude, social intelligence), intellectual (zest, curiosity), and intrapersonal (academic self-control, grit) factors of character. In Study 2, children rated their own behavior and completed a test of cognitive ability. Confirmatory factor analyses supported the same three-factor structure, and these factors were only weakly associated with cognitive ability. In Study 3, teachers provided character ratings; in parallel, students completed measures of character as well as Big Five personality factors. As expected, intellectual, interpersonal, and intrapersonal character factors related to Big Five openness to experience, agreeableness, and conscientiousness, respectively. Across studies, positive peer relations were most consistently predicted by interpersonal character, class participation by intellectual character, and report card grades by intrapersonal character. Collectively, our findings support a tripartite taxonomy of character in the school context.", "The cooperation of software-defined networking and flexible grid optical transport technology allows operators to elastically control the network using software running on a network operating system within a centralized way. However, existing approaches dealing with spectrum fragmentation are mostly the reactive strategy, which reconfigures network resources to overcome spectrum fragmentation when the controller detects the fragmentation. In this paper, we focus on how to improve the control plane intelligence of software-defined elastic optical networks (SD-EONs) by using a proactive strategy. More specifically, we design a novel routing, modulation level and spectrum allocation algorithm (RMLSA) based on spectral efficiency and connectivity (SEC) i.e., SEC-RMLSA, in order to improve the utilization efficiency of network resources. Meanwhile, we develop a routing application and an extended OpenFlow protocol to achieve a seamless operation between the controller and the optical data plane. Moreover, all the proposed methodologies are implemented and demonstrated in an SD-EON testbed that has both OpenFlow-based control plane and data plane. Finally, the proposed framework, experimental demonstration, and numerical evaluation are reported for different optical flows. The results show the system's overall feasibility and efficiency.", "Bipolar disorder is associated with cognitive dysfunction in several domains. Medication effect is a potential confounder that can only be statistically controlled in many studies. The cognitive profile in bipolar disorder during remission on maintenance antipsychotics or mood stabilizers medication has not been compared before.\nWe compared the cognitive profile of bipolar disorder patients euthymic for 2 month or more on monotherapy with novel antipsychotics (AP) (n=16), lithium carbonate (Li) (n=25) or valproic acid (VPA; n=26). Forty-two individuals were assessed as controls. The cognitive battery included Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised (WAIS-R) subtests, the Wechsler Memory Scale (WMS), and Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST).\nAll three patient groups compared to controls performed poorly on the working memory and verbal memory tasks (F=3.59, df=3, p=0.02 for WAIS-R Arithmetic and F=123.64, df=3, p<0.01 for WMS Logical Memory). The differences remained significant after controlling for age. Across patients, the only significant difference was between the Li and AP groups in terms of working memory. The Li group performed better (F=3.59, df=2, p=0.02) and the difference survived correction for age and clinical features.\nThe findings of this study suggest that working memory impairment in bipolar patients on monotherapy with atypical AP, whereas verbal memory impairment might be related to bipolar disorder itself. Working memory might be a state marker, whereas verbal memory could be a trait marker of bipolar disorder. Atypical AP might have an adverse effect on cognition in bipolar disorder. These findings cannot be generalized to all bipolar patients, particularly the poor responders to monotherapy.", "To describe the methodology utilized to calculate reliability and the generation of norms for 10 neuropsychological tests for children in Spanish-speaking countries.\nThe study sample consisted of over 4,373 healthy children from nine countries in Latin America (Chile, Cuba, Ecuador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru, and Puerto Rico) and Spain. Inclusion criteria for all countries were to have between 6 to 17 years of age, an Intelligence Quotient of\u226580 on the Test of Non-Verbal Intelligence (TONI-2), and score of\u200a<19 on the Children's Depression Inventory. Participants completed 10 neuropsychological tests. Reliability and norms were calculated for all tests.\nTest-retest analysis showed excellent or good- reliability on all tests (r's>0.55; p's<0.001) except M-WCST perseverative errors whose coefficient magnitude was fair. All scores were normed using multiple linear regressions and standard deviations of residual values. Age, age2, sex, and mean level of parental education (MLPE) were included as predictors in the models by country. The non-significant variables (p\u200a>\u200a0.05) were removed and the analysis were run again.\nThis is the largest Spanish-speaking children and adolescents normative study in the world. For the generation of normative data, the method based on linear regression models and the standard deviation of residual values was used. This method allows determination of the specific variables that predict test scores, helps identify and control for collinearity of predictive variables, and generates continuous and more reliable norms than those of traditional methods.", "Real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) has become a widely used method for accurate expression profiling of targeted mRNA and ncRNA. Selection of appropriate internal control genes for RT-qPCR normalization is an elementary prerequisite for reliable expression measurement. Here, we present ICG (http://icg.big.ac.cn), a wiki-driven knowledgebase for community curation of experimentally validated internal control genes as well as their associated experimental conditions. Unlike extant related databases that focus on qPCR primers in model organisms (mainly human and mouse), ICG features harnessing collective intelligence in community integration of internal control genes for a variety of species. Specifically, it integrates a comprehensive collection of more than 750 internal control genes for 73 animals, 115 plants, 12 fungi and 9 bacteria, and incorporates detailed information on recommended application scenarios corresponding to specific experimental conditions, which, collectively, are of great help for researchers to adopt appropriate internal control genes for their own experiments. Taken together, ICG serves as a publicly editable and open-content encyclopaedia of internal control genes and accordingly bears broad utility for reliable RT-qPCR normalization and gene expression characterization in both model and non-model organisms.", "Arc is an activity-regulated neuronal protein, but little is known about its interactions, assembly into multiprotein complexes, and role in human disease and cognition. We applied an integrated proteomic and genetic strategy by targeting a tandem affinity purification (TAP) tag and Venus fluorescent protein into the endogenous Arc gene in mice. This allowed biochemical and proteomic characterization of native complexes in wild-type and knockout mice. We identified many Arc-interacting proteins, of which PSD95 was the most abundant. PSD95 was essential for Arc assembly into 1.5-MDa complexes and activity-dependent recruitment to excitatory synapses. Integrating human genetic data with proteomic data showed that Arc-PSD95 complexes are\u00a0enriched in schizophrenia, intellectual disability, autism, and epilepsy mutations and normal variants in intelligence. We propose that Arc-PSD95 postsynaptic complexes potentially affect human cognitive function.", "Maroteaux-Lamy syndrome (MLS) is a rare progressive condition characterized by inflammation and scarring of multiple organs. Ocular complications caused by anterior segment abnormalities commonly cause visual impairment in MLS. Angle-closure glaucoma is one such complication, but there are limited data on presentation, workup, and management of this condition.\nThis case report describes an atypical presentation of acute angle-closure glaucoma in a patient with MLS despite a prior prophylactic laser peripheral iridotomy-which would typically prevent an acute angle-closure attack-that was patent and intact at the time of angle closure.\nBecause of severe congenital anterior segment crowding, high axial hyperopia, and constant accommodative demand in patients with MLS, we recommend performing two prophylactic laser peripheral iridotomies simultaneously in the same eye instead of one. The mechanism for this indication differs from that in patients at risk of acute angle-closure glaucoma because of lens zonulopathy alone. We hope that this case report may help prevent vision loss and optimize quality of life in patients with MLS who may be wheelchair-bound but are typically high functioning with normal intelligence.", "Social difficulties are a key aspect of autism, but the intervening factors are still poorly understood. This study had two objectives: to compare the profile of ToM skills, executive functioning (EF), and pragmatic competence (PC) of children with high-functioning autism (HFA) and children with typical development (TD), and analyze their mediator role in social functioning. The participants were 52 children with HFA and 37 children with TD matched on age, intelligence quotient, and expressive vocabulary. Significant differences were found on measures of ToM, both explicit and applied, EF, and PC between children with HFA and TD. Multiple mediation analysis revealed that applied ToM skills and PC mediated the relations between autism symptoms and social functioning. Implications for social cognitive interventions to address these findings are discussed.", "To study the long-term evolution of speech and intelligence in a child with partial deafness and normal hearing in the low frequencies after sequentially receiving cochlear implants in both ears.\nRetrospective chart review.\nMale child aged 6 years was followed over a time period of four years.\nThe paediatric patient had normal hearing up to 1\u2009kHz and profound hearing loss at all higher frequencies symmetrical in both ears. Deprivation of high-frequency sounds resulted in retarded development of speech, language and cognitive skills. The choice for rehabilitation was cochlear implantation with the aim of preserving a considerable amount of low-frequency hearing. With natural hearing at low frequencies and electrical stimulation at high frequencies, the child was able to compensate most of his developmental deficits. Moreover, spatial hearing was almost normal.\nElectro-natural stimulation without amplification of the low frequencies (electro-natural hearing) provides access to the whole audible frequency range for children, who suffer from partial deafness in the high frequencies and are normal hearing at low frequencies. Such provision allows for regular speech development and favours the development of spatial hearing. The case report also demonstrates a strong impact on intellectual performance.", "This article explores the content of letters of complaint by patients and carers about the behaviour, attitudes and communication of healthcare staff.\nThe most common focus of patient complaints in the UK and other high-income countries is staff attitudes, behaviour and communication. There is a move to learn lessons from patient complaints, which can be used to improve patient care and experience.\nFifty letters of complaint made by patients and carers relating to the behaviour, attitudes and communication of healthcare staff were analysed.\nPoor attitudes, behaviours and communication have significant negative impact on the emotional well-being of patients and carers. Many patients and carers have heightened sensitivities due to both health-related stresses and also other factors. The healthcare role is expected to include compassion and kindness. The concept of emotional labour is useful in explaining the skills and effort required of staff in this often invisible and undervalued aspect of health care.\nGiven the increasing focus on patient experience, it is important that the importance of good staff attitudes, behaviours and communication is understood and that the emotional labour associated with this is recognised.\nAn understanding of emotional intelligence can protect staff from burnout and other negative outcomes which those in a caring role can experience.", "Higher early-life intelligence is associated with a reduced risk of mortality in adulthood, though this association is apparently hardly attenuated when accounting for early-life socio-economic status (SES). However, the use of proxy measures of SES means that residual confounding may underestimate this attenuation. In the present study, the potential confounding effect of early-life SES was instead accounted for by examining the intelligence-mortality association within families.\nThe association between early-life intelligence and mortality in adulthood was assessed in 727 members of the 6-Day Sample of the Scottish Mental Survey 1947 and, for the first time, 1580 of their younger siblings. These individuals were born between 1936 and 1958, and were followed up into later life, with deaths recorded up to 2015. Cox regression was used to estimate the relative risk of mortality associated with higher IQ scores after adjusting for shared family factors.\nA standard-deviation advantage in IQ score was associated with a significantly reduced mortality risk [hazard ratio\u2009=\u20090.76, p\u2009<\u20090.001, 95% confidence interval (CI) (0.68-0.84)]. This reduction in hazard was only slightly attenuated by adjusting for sex and shared family factors [hazard ratio\u2009=\u20090.79, p\u2009=\u20090.002, 95% CI (0.68-0.92)].\nAlthough somewhat conservative, adjusting for all variance shared by a family avoids any potential residual confounding of the intelligence-mortality association arising from the use of proxy measures of early-life SES. The present study demonstrates that the longevity associated with higher early-life intelligence cannot be explained by early-life SES or within-family factors.", "Little is known about the affected cognitive problems in chronic low back pain patients. For this patient cohort research mostly focused on memory of pain, rather than cognitive difficulties related to pain. Chronic pain may be associated with specific (yet undefined) cognitive deficits that affect everyday behaviour. We set out to compare the cognitive function of patients with chronic low back pain (cLBP) in the course of multidisciplinary pain treatments before and after therapy.\nThirty-three patients with cLBP and 25 healthy controls between 20 and 70 years were recruited into the study. The inclusion criteria for patients were: (1) a history of at least 12 weeks of chronic myofascial low back pain without radicular pain sensation before enrolment; (2) grade II and higher chronicity according to von Korff; (3) no opioid medication. The patients recruited had a mean pain duration of 7.13\u00b17.16 years and reported a mean pain intensity of 6.62\u00b12.04 (visual analogue score, VAS). Their mean back function according to the Funktionsfragebogen Hannover (FFbH, a questionnaire comparable with the Health Assessment Questionnaire) was 52.39\u00b120.23%. At three time points (before therapy, 3 weeks and 6 months after therapy) the study subjects were assessed prospectively with a battery of visual memory tests from the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB). These included choice reaction time (CRT), pattern recognition memory (PRM) and spatial span (SSP). In parallel, the Trail-Making Test (TMT-A, TMT-B) and the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS-III) were used to evaluate intelligence and cognitive flexibility.\nAt the beginning of MDPT (T1), it took patients with cLBP significantly longer than HC to complete TMT-A (38.29\u00b119.99s vs 30.25\u00b114.19s, p=0.047) and TMT-B (72.10\u00b126.98s vs 55.99\u00b122.14s, p=0.034). There were no significant differences between patients and HC in CRT, PRM and SSP. Three weeks (T2) and 6 months (T3) after MDPT, TMT-A reaction time of patients significantly improved by 6.5s and 8.1ms (38.3 \u00b119.9s vs 31.8\u00b112.3s, p=0.02 and 31.8\u00b112.3s vs 30.2\u00b18.9s, p=0.021, respectively). The patients' working memory was also better 6 months after MDPT (48.8\u00b111.1% at T1, 51.2\u00b111.9% at T2, 57.1\u00b110.9% at T3, p=0.008). Significant correlations among pain, depression/anxiety, medication and neuropsychological tests were found.\nThese findings show that patients with cLBP have slowed speeds of information processing and working memory, but no alteration in attention and recognition memory. There are clearly interactions of cognitive function with pain, depression, anxiety, and medication. MDPT may improve the impaired cognitive function of patients with cLBP.\nHealth professionals should contemplate the results from this study when planning therapy strategies especially when prescribing pain medications such opioids to patients with chronic low back pain.", "Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common. Antibiotic treatment is usually empirical, with the risk of under-treatment of resistant infections.\nTo characterize risk factors for antibiotic-resistant community urine isolates using routine record-linked health data.\nWithin the NHS Scotland Infection Intelligence Platform, national surveillance patient-level data on community urine isolates (January 2012-June 2015) were linked to hospital activity and community prescribing data. Associations between age, gender, comorbidity, care home residence, previous hospitalizations, antibiotic exposure and resistant (any antibiotic) or MDR (\u22651 antibiotic from \u22653 categories) urinary isolates were quantified using multivariable logistic regression.\nOf 40984 isolates, 28% were susceptible, 45% were resistant and 27% were MDR. Exposure to\u2009\u2265\u20094 different antibiotics in the prior 6\u2009months increased MDR risk (OR 6.81, 95% CI 5.73-8.11). MDR was associated with \u226529 DDD cumulative exposure, in the prior 6\u2009months, for any antibiotic (OR 6.54, 95% CI 5.88-7.27), nitrofurantoin (OR 8.56, 95% CI 6.56-11.18) and trimethoprim (OR 14.61, 95% CI 10.53-20.27). Associations persisted for 10-12\u2009months for nitrofurantoin (OR 2.31, 95% CI 1.93-2.76) and trimethoprim (OR 1.81, 95% CI 1.57-2.09). Increasing age, comorbidity, previous hospitalization and care home residence were independently associated with MDR. For resistant isolates the factors were the same, but with weaker associations.\nTo our knowledge, we have demonstrated, using national capability at scale, the risk of MDR in community urine isolates for the first time and quantified the cumulative and sustained impact of antibiotic exposure. These data will inform the development of decision support tools for UTI treatment.", "Maeterlinck did not mean to suggest that honeybees rival humans in intelligence - rather he saw in the bee a qualitatively different form of intelligence, tailored to the challenges of a profoundly different kind of society and lifestyle. Insects are strange \"aliens from inner space\", with sensory and cognitive worlds wholly different from our own. The 19th century discovery that ants can detect ultraviolet light triggered a golden age in the exploration of the diversity of sensory systems of insects (and indeed other animals), identifying such abilities as magnetic compasses, electrosensitivity, polarization vision, and peculiar locations for sense organs such as the infrared sensors on the abdomens of some beetles or photoreceptors on the genitalia of some butterflies. Could insect minds be equally strange and diverse?", "The lifetime risk of suicide and suicide attempt in patients with schizophrenia are 5% and 25%-50%, respectively. The current meta-analysis aims to determine risk factors associated with suicidality in subjects with schizophrenia. We searched Pubmed, Web of Science, EMBASE, and the reference lists of included studies. Inclusion criteria were met if an article reported a dichotomous sample of patients with schizophrenia with suicidal ideation, attempted suicide, or suicide compared to patients without. We also performed a cohort study meta-analysis as a supplemental analysis. A total of 96 studies with 80488 participants were included in our analysis. Depressive symptoms (P < .0001), Positive and Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS) general score (P < .0001) and number of psychiatric hospitalizations (P < .0001) were higher in patients with suicide ideation. History of alcohol use (P = .0001), family history of psychiatric illness (P < .0001), physical comorbidity (P < .0001), history of depression (P < .0001), family history of suicide (P < .0001), history of drug use (P = .0024), history of tobacco use (P = .0034), being white (P = .0022), and depressive symptoms (P < .0001) were the most consistent variables associated with suicide attempts. The first two were also significant in the cohort meta-analysis. Being male (P = .0005), history of attempted suicide (P < .0001), younger age (P = .0266), higher intelligence quotient (P < .0001), poor adherence to treatment (P < .0001), and hopelessness (P < .0001) were the most consistently associated with suicide. The first three were also significant in the cohort meta-analysis. Our findings may help with future development of preventive strategies to combat suicide. Future studies may combine the above-mentioned variables by using multivariate predictive analysis techniques to objectively stratify suicidality in schizophrenia.", "Multiparametric magnetic resonance/ultrasound targeted prostate biopsy is touted as a tool to improve prostate cancer care and yet its true clinical usefulness over transrectal ultrasound guided prostate biopsy has not been systematically analyzed. We introduce 2 metrics to better quantify and report the deliverables of targeted biopsy.\nWe reviewed our prospective database of patients who underwent simultaneous multiparametric magnetic resonance/ultrasound targeted prostate biopsy and transrectal ultrasound guided prostate biopsy. Actionable intelligence metric was defined as the proportion of patients in whom targeted biopsy provided actionable information over transrectal ultrasound guided prostate biopsy. Reduction metric was defined as the proportion of men in whom transrectal ultrasound guided prostate biopsy could have been omitted. We compared metrics in our cohort with those in prior reports.\nA total of 371 men were included in study. The actionable intelligence and reduction metrics were 22.2% and 83.6% in biopsy na\u00efve cases, 26.7% and 84.2% in prior negative transrectal ultrasound guided prostate biopsy cases, and 24% and 77.5%, respectively, in active surveillance cases. No significant differences were observed among the groups in the actionable intelligence metric and the reduction metric (p = 0.89 and 0.27, respectively). The actionable intelligence metric was 25.0% for PI-RADS\u2122 (Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System) 3, 27.5% for PI-RADS 4 and 21.7% for PI-RADS 5 lesions (p = 0.73). Transrectal ultrasound guided prostate biopsy could have been avoided in more patients with PI-RADS 3 compared to PI-RADS 4/5 lesions (reduction metric 92.0% vs 76.7%, p\u00a0<0.01). Our results compare favorably to those of other reported series.\nThe actionable intelligence metric and the reduction metric are novel, clinically relevant quantification metrics to standardize the reporting of multiparametric magnetic resonance/ultrasound targeted prostate biopsy deliverables. Targeted biopsy provides actionable information in about 25% of men. Reduction metric assessment highlights that transrectal ultrasound guided prostate biopsy may only be omitted after carefully considering the risk of missing clinically significant cancers.", "Trigger factors for Salmonella infections Salmonella Typhimurium DT104 updateControl measures for Salmonella in livestockPublic health considerations These issues are considered in this month's surveillance focus article, which has been prepared by Gareth Hateley, veterinary lead of the Cattle Expert Group, and Amanda Carson, veterinary lead of the Small Ruminant Expert Group, of the APHA Surveillance Intelligence Unit.", "This short review looks at Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis through my own point of view, going from imaging through cerebrospinal fluid to blood proteins. Over the last couple of years, we have published two papers targeted at Alzheimer's diagnosis. In one paper, we took an approach of selecting a specific target, namely, activity-dependent neuroprotective protein (ADNP), and our results tightened the association of ADNP blood expression with intelligence. In another paper, we took an unbiased approach of analysis of all genes expressed in lymphoblastoid cells lines and discovered changes in expression of the regulator of G-protein signaling 2 (RGS2) as a potential AD predictor. This review will assess our data in comparison to selected independent studies focusing on blood protein biomarkers as well as assessing saliva and urine samples with potential predictive value for AD. Furthermore, the review will provide directions for a combination of innovative markers, stratifying the population toward disease prevention and personalized medicine.", "Iodine deficiency during pregnancy might be associated with reduced intelligence quotient (IQ) score in offspring. We assessed the effect of iodine supplementation in mildly iodine-deficient pregnant women on neurodevelopment of their offspring in areas where schoolchildren were iodine sufficient.\nIn this randomised, placebo-controlled trial, pregnant women in Bangalore, India, and Bangkok, Thailand, were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive 200 \u03bcg iodine orally once a day or placebo until delivery. Randomisation was done with a computer-generated sequence and stratified by site. Co-primary outcomes were verbal and performance IQ scores on the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence Third Edition (WPPSI-III) and the global executive composite score from the Behaviour Rating Inventory of Executive Function-Preschool Version (BRIEF-P) in the children at age 5-6 years. The trial was double-blinded; some unmasking took place at age 2 years for an interim analysis, but participants and nearly all investigators remained masked to group assignment until age 5-6 years. Analysis was by intention to treat using mixed-effects models. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00791466.\nBetween Nov 18, 2008, and March 12, 2011, 832 women entered the trial at a mean gestational age of 10\u00b77 weeks (SD 2\u00b77); median urinary iodine concentration was 131 \u03bcg/L (IQR 81-213). Mean compliance with supplementation was 87%, assessed by monthly tablet counts. 313 children (iodine group, n=159; placebo group, n=154) were analysed for verbal and performance IQ with WPPSI-III and 315 (iodine group, n=159; placebo group, n=156) for overall executive function with BRIEF-P. Mean WPPSI-III scores for verbal IQ were 89\u00b75 (SD 9\u00b78) in the iodine group and 90\u00b72 (9\u00b78) in the placebo group (difference -0\u00b77, 95% CI -2\u00b79 to 1\u00b75; p=0\u00b777), and for performance IQ were 97\u00b75 (12\u00b75) in the iodine group and 99\u00b71 (13\u00b74) in the placebo group (difference -1\u00b76, -4\u00b75 to 1\u00b73; p=0\u00b744). The mean BRIEF-P global executive composite score was 90\u00b76 (26\u00b72) in the iodine group and 91\u00b75 (27\u00b70) in the placebo group (difference -0\u00b79, -6\u00b78 to 5\u00b70; p=0\u00b774). The frequency of adverse events did not differ between groups during gestation or at delivery: 24 women in the iodine group and 28 in the placebo group reported adverse events (iodine group: abortion, n=20; blighted ovum, and n=2; intrauterine death, n=2; placebo group: abortion, n=22; blighted ovum, n=1; intrauterine death, n=2; early neonatal death, n=1; and neonatal death, n=2).\nDaily iodine supplementation in mildly iodine-deficient pregnant women had no effect on child neurodevelopment at age 5-6 years.\nSwiss National Science Foundation, Nestl\u00e9 Foundation, Wageningen University and Research, and ETH Zurich.", "A European health information system (HIS) supports mutual learning between member states through international comparisons. In addition, it informs international policy agendas. Collaboration between the major stakeholders, most importantly the World Health Organization Regional Office for Europe (WHO-Euro), the European Commission and OECD, is important for member states, as this will contribute to better and more efficiently produced health intelligence. This paper focuses on this 'supra-international' collaboration. Although progress has been made, most notably in relation to joint data collections on monetary and non-monetary healthcare statistics, there is still room for improvement, both in relation to the harmonization of indicators and their underlying data collections, and the better coordination of reporting and research and development work. The working environment is complex, and differences between the (scope of the) health information activities of the three international organizations must be accepted. Yet there is enough common ground to build on. In addition, important barriers hampering further progress are the current semantic confusion about what constitutes a(n international) HIS, and inadequate coordination of national positions across various technical and political platforms of the international organizations. A pragmatic, bottom-up approach, instead of technically and strategically complex and comprehensive solutions, seems the best way forward. The current momentum created by EU-level developments and networks like the European Health Information Initiative of WHO-Euro provide an opportunity for taking the overarching European HIS to a next level.", "Decision-making in the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) has been intensively studied regarding both the \"hot\" and \"cold\" components. The ventromedial prefrontal cortex is a key region involved in processing somatic marker information, though recent findings suggest dorsolateral regions are also important. The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is also known as a substrate of executive functions-the cold component of decision-making. However, there is contradictory evidence about the role of executive functions, as well as the hot component of decision-making-emotional intelligence. Previous findings suggest that patients with right frontal lobe lesions find decision-making more problematic in IGT. The goal of this study is to replicate previous findings on IGT performance in patients with dorsolateral lesions compared to controls.\nWe obtained data from patients with right frontal lobe tumors (n = 12), localized in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and healthy controls (n = 21) who undertook the IGT, Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST), Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test (MSCEIT), and D-KEFS Color-Word Interference Test.\nThe performance in the IGT, WCST, and EI tests is impaired in the clinical group. At the subgroup level, we found patients had lower EI scores regarding the ability to use \"emotions for thinking facilitation\". However, we found an interaction between the EI scores regarding the ability \"the perception and identification of emotions\" and the performance on WCST only in the patient group.\nThis study raises the possibility of identifying components of EI which could be helpful in understanding the impairment of patients with right dorsolateral lesions.", "Duplications of Yq arm (and AZF) seems to be tolerated by fertile males, while mutations, deletions, duplications or haploinsufficiency of SHOX can originate a wide range of phenotypes, including short stature and skeletal abnormalities. We report a case of non-obstructive azoospermia in a young man with short stature, skeletal anomalies, normal intelligence and hormonal parameters. This male showed a very singular Y-chromosome aberration, consisting of a duplication of Yq and proximal regions of Yp, with a deletion of almost all PAR1 in Yptel, including SHOX. CBA- and RBA-banding and FISH-mapping with telomeric, centromeric, AZF and SHOX probes were used. These results were confirmed by array CGH, which revealed the following karyotype constitution: arr [hg19] Xp22.33 or Yp11.32p11.31 (310,932-2,646,815 or 260,932-2,596,815) \u00d71, Yp11.2q12 (8,641,183-59,335,913) \u00d72. We conclude that the haploinsufficience of SHOX may be the cause of short stature and skeletal defects in the patient, while the non-obstructive azoospermia could be related to the lack of X-Y pairing during meiosis originated by the anomalous configuration of this chromosome abnormality and large deletion which occurred in Yp-PAR1.", "Acetaminophen is thought to be the safest analgesic and antipyretic medicine for pregnant women, and it is widely used all over the world. However, prenatal acetaminophen was reported to be associated with asthma, lower performance intelligence quotient (IQ), shorter male infant anogenital distance (predicting poor male reproductive potential), autism spectrum disorder, neurodevelopmental problems (gross motor development, communication), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, poorer attention and executive function, and behavioral problems in childhood. Each article has poor power to show risks of acetaminophen, however, the integration of the articles that showed adverse effects of acetaminophen may have power to show them. Acetaminophen use in childhood was associated with autism spectrum disorder, asthma symptoms, wheezing, and allergic disease. Acetaminophen is the safest medicine as analgesics for nociceptive pain and antipyretics in childhood and pregnancy. There is no alternative medication of acetaminophen. Acetaminophen should not be withheld from children or pregnant women for fears it might develop adverse effects. Acetaminophen should be used at the lowest effective dosage and for the shortest time. When we know the possible, rare but serious complications, we should use acetaminophen in pregnancy only when needed and no safer option for pain or fever relief is available. Health care providers should help inform the general lay public about this difficult dilemma.", "Applications of psychology to education and assessment often take for granted Western cultural assumptions about the nature of intelligence, ignore cultural features of human cognition other than language, and liken the influence of socialization on development to biological nutrition. Such oversimplifications can lead to stigmatizing culturally different persons as atypical or deficient and to perpetuating oppressive cultural hegemony. A cultural lens can benefit psychological science by facilitating communication with diverse audiences, channeling new knowledge into social progress, and generating theoretical insights about human behavior and experience, such as linguistic flexibility as a dimension of cognition, social responsibility as a dimension of intelligence, and intimate culture as a filter between larger social representations and the frame of reference for an individual mind.", "Individuals with type 1 diabetes have to monitor their blood glucose levels, determine the quantity of insulin required to achieve optimal glycaemic control and administer it themselves subcutaneously, multiple times per day. To help with this process bolus calculators have been developed that suggest the appropriate dose. However these calculators do not automatically adapt to the specific circumstances of an individual and require fine-tuning of parameters, a process that often requires the input of an expert. To overcome the limitations of the traditional methods this paper proposes the use of an artificial intelligence technique, case-based reasoning, to personalise the bolus calculation. A novel aspect of our approach is the use of temporal sequences to take into account preceding events when recommending the bolus insulin doses rather than looking at events in isolation. The in silico results described in this paper show that given the initial conditions of the patient, the temporal retrieval algorithm identifies the most suitable case for reuse. Additionally through insulin-on-board adaptation and postprandial revision, the approach is able to learn and improve bolus predictions, reducing the blood glucose risk index by up to 27% after three revisions of a bolus solution.", "A growing body of literature has linked chronotype and sleep to school performance. Chronotype is under the control of the circadian clock and refers to sleep timing and diurnal preferences. Chronotype changes with age and is latest during adolescence, giving rise to a mismatch between the (late) circadian clock and the (early) school clock. In general, evening (late) chronotypes obtain lower grades. School performance is influenced by many other factors, such as motivation, intelligence, and conscientiousness. Some of these factors also relate to chronotype. The present paper reviews the literature on the relationship between chronotype and school performance, with the aim of suggesting hypotheses about the mechanisms behind this complex phenomenon and exploring solutions for an optimized school system. Based on the literature reviewed, we hypothesize that chronotype has both a direct and an indirect effect on school performance. The indirect effect is mediated by factors such as conscientiousness, learning/achieving motivation, mood, and alertness. In addition, time of day of testing plays an important role since the chronotype effect on grades is strongest in the morning and disappears in the afternoon. Strategies to decrease the mismatch between the adolescent circadian clock and the school clock could involve light interventions to advance the students' sleep timing, delays in school starting times, and rearrangements of test schedules (tests later in the day).", "Parkinson's disease (PD) typically occurs in elderly people and some degree of cognitive impairment is usually present. Cognitive reserve (CR) theory was proposed to explain the discrepancy between the degree of brain pathologies and clinical manifestations. We administered a comprehensive neuropsychological battery to 35 non-demented participants affected by PD. All participants underwent also the Cognitive Reserve Index questionnaire and the Brief Intelligence Test as proxies for CR. Relationships between CR and cognitive performance were investigated by linear regression analyses, adjusting for significant confounding factors. At linear regression analyses, higher CR scores were independently associated with a better performance on Word Fluency (p\u2009\u2264\u20090.04) and Digit Span (backward) (p\u2009\u2264\u20090.02); no associations were observed between CR and other cognitive tests. Our data provide empirical support to the relation between CR and cognitive impairment in PD. In particular, this study suggests that CR may have greater effects on the cognitive areas mostly affected in PD as executive functions.", "Next generation sequencing (NGS) of cancer genomes is now becoming a prerequisite for accurate diagnosis and proper treatment in clinical oncology. Because the genomic regions for NGS expand from a certain set of genes to the whole exome or whole genome, the resulting sequence data becomes incredibly enormous and makes it quite laborious to translate the genomic data into medicine, so-called annotation and curation. We organized a clinical sequencing team and established a bidirectional (bed-to-bench and bench-to-bed) system to integrate clinical and genomic data for hematological malignancies. We also started a collaborative research project with IBM Japan to adopt the artificial intelligence Watson for Genomics (WfG) to the pipeline of medical informatics. Genomic DNA was prepared from malignant as well as normal tissues in each patient and subjected to NGS. Sequence data was analyzed using an in-house semi-automated pipeline in combination with WfG, which was used to identify candidate driver mutations and relevant pathways from which applicable drug information was deduced. Currently, we have analyzed more than 150 patients with hematological disorders, including AML and ALL, and obtained many informative findings. In this presentation, I will introduce some of the achievements we have made so far.", "A growing number of studies have linked facial width-to-height ratio (fWHR) with various antisocial or violent behavioral tendencies. However, those studies have predominantly been laboratory based and low powered. This work reexamined the links between fWHR and behavioral tendencies in a large sample of 137,163 participants. Behavioral tendencies were measured using 55 well-established psychometric scales, including self-report scales measuring intelligence, domains and facets of the five-factor model of personality, impulsiveness, sense of fairness, sensational interests, self-monitoring, impression management, and satisfaction with life. The findings revealed that fWHR is not substantially linked with any of these self-reported measures of behavioral tendencies, calling into question whether the links between fWHR and behavior generalize beyond the small samples and specific experimental settings that have been used in past fWHR research.", "Cognitive deficits are prevalent in people with schizophrenia and associated with functional impairments. In addition to antipsychotics, pharmacotherapy in schizophrenia often includes other psychotropics, and some of these agents possess anticholinergic properties, which may impair cognition. The objective of this study was to explore the association between medication anticholinergic burden and cognition in schizophrenia.\nSeven hundred five individuals with schizophrenia completed a neuropsychological battery comprising Judgment of Line Orientation Test, Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence Matrix Reasoning, Continuous Performance Test-Identical Pairs Version, and the Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia. Cognitive g and 3 cognitive factor scores that include executive function, memory/fluency, and speed of processing/vigilance, which were derived from a previously published analysis, were entered as cognitive variables. Anticholinergic burden was computed using 2 anticholinergic scales: Anticholinergic Burden Scale and Anticholinergic Drug Scale. Duration and severity of illness, antipsychotic dose, smoking status, age, and sex were included as covariates.\nAnticholinergic burden was associated with poorer cognitive performance in cognitive g, all 3 cognitive domains and most cognitive tasks in multivariate analyses. The associations were statistically significant, but the effect sizes were small (for Anticholinergic Burden Scale, Cohen f = 0.008; for Anticholinergic Drug Scale, Cohen f = 0.017).\nAlthough our results showed a statistically significant association between medications with anticholinergic properties and cognition in people with schizophrenia, the impact is of doubtful or minimal clinical significance.", "Large-for-gestational-age (LGA) babies have a higher risk of metabolic disease later in life, and their postnatal growth in early childhood may be associated with long-term adverse outcomes. This study aimed to determine childhood health outcomes of term LGA babies with different growth patterns. Data were obtained from the US Collaborative Perinatal Project for the years between 1959 and 1976. The growth trajectories of 3,316 term LGA babies were identified and odds ratios of obesity, growth restriction, low intelligence quotient (IQ), and high blood pressure (HBP) were calculated by logistic regression. Compared with term appropriate-for-gestational-age infants, term LGA babies without catch-down growth had increased risks of obesity (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 6.37, 95% confidence interval (CI): 5.24, 7.73) and HBP (aOR = 1.67, 95% CI: 1.37, 2.03). Those with high catch-down growth had higher risks of growth restriction (aOR = 2.21, 95% CI: 1.66, 2.95) and low IQ (aOR = 1.61, 95% CI: 1.04, 2.49). Nevertheless, infants with small catch-down growth had lower risks of obesity (aOR = 0.78, 95% CI: 0.63, 0.95), growth restriction (aOR = 0.28, 95% CI: 0.17, 0.46), low IQ (aOR = 0.66, 95% CI: 0.41, 1.06), and HBP (aOR = 0.89, 95% CI: 0.77, 1.04). According to our data, term LGA infants with small catch-down growth had no increased risks of adverse outcomes.", "Computational machine learning, especially self-enhancing algorithms, prove remarkable effectiveness in applications, including cardiovascular medicine. This review summarizes and cross-compares the current machine learning algorithms applied to electrocardiogram interpretation. In practice, continuous real-time monitoring of electrocardiograms is still difficult to realize. Furthermore, automated ECG interpretation by implementing specific artificial intelligence algorithms is even more challenging. By collecting large datasets from one individual, computational approaches can assure an efficient personalized treatment strategy, such as a correct prediction on patient-specific disease progression, therapeutic success rate and limitations of certain interventions, thus reducing the hospitalization costs and physicians' workload. Clearly such aims can be achieved by a perfect symbiosis of a multidisciplinary team involving clinicians, researchers and computer scientists. Summarizing, continuous cross-examination between machine intelligence and human intelligence is a combination of precision, rationale and high-throughput scientific engine integrated into a challenging framework of big data science.", "The number of successful pregnancies in kidney transplant (KT) recipients has increased in recent years. Little evidence is available about the risk of in utero immunosuppressive exposure for long-term cognitive consequences. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of immunosuppression during pregnancy on intellectual performance of children born to KT recipients.\nUsing a cross-sectional design, women who had undergone KT and their children (aged 4+ years) were recruited at the outpatient follow-up in five transplant centers. Women who did not receive immunosuppression during pregnancy with similar distributions of socioeconomic status and length of gestation and their children were also recruited. Children were assessed with Wechsler Intelligence Scales.\nThe study sample included 50 exposed and 50 unexposed children. No differences between groups in all the proposed confounding factors were found. Full-scale IQ did not differ significantly between both groups. Also, significant differences in any index or subscale score were not observed, with the exception of time required to complete the Wechsler preschool and primary scale of intelligence (WPPSI) Zoo locations subtest, which was done quicker in the unexposed group (p\u2009=\u2009.007). Exposure to immunosuppression during pregnancy was not a significant predictor of low IQ in logistic regression after adjustment for other factors.\nImmunosuppression therapy during pregnancy of KT women did not affect global intellectual performance of their offspring, except maybe for visuospatial working memory in preschool children.", "Thyroid hormones play a pivotal role in somatic growth, metabolic regulation and neurodevelopment. There is growing evidence regarding adverse obstetric and perinatal consequences of maternal thyroid hypofunction during early stages of pregnancy. These include: early pregnancy loss, preterm delivery and lower intelligence quotient (IQ) in children. Different clinical guidelines have been published by scientific societies for the management of thyroid diseases during pregnancy and levothyroxine (LT4) has become a therapeutic agent increasingly prescribed by obstetricians. The aim of this work was to search for both similarities and controversial clinical aspects from the currently available literature. Guidelines published from 2011 onwards have been analysed and compared, in order to clarify the evidence about the involvement of thyroid dysfunction in pregnancy complications and the impact of LT4 use in their prevention and/or treatment. This review summarizes the most updated knowledge about the effectiveness of LT4 for pregnancy complications, the current recommendations and its application into clinical practice. KEY MESSAGES The use of levothyroxine in obstetric practices requires a correct diagnosis and to consider the specific recommendations for each thyroid dysfunction entity. The effectiveness and safety of levothyroxine treatment in preventing adverse perinatal events in pregnant women with clinical hypothyroidism is supported by all the current guidelines. Levothyroxine therapy is strongly recommended in all cases of overt hypothyroidism and in cases of subclinical hypothyroidism associated to positive thyroid autoimmunity.", "Vocal fry is a prevalent speech feature in college-aged American women living in the United States. However, there is currently little consensus about how its use influences listener judgments of the speaker. This study investigated how vocal fry influences judgments of intelligence and the likability of young adult female speakers of American English while taking into account the surrounding acoustic-prosodic context, specifically voice pitch and speech rate.\nSpeech samples were obtained from eight American English-speaking females who presented with different combinations of voice pitch (low or high), speech rate (slow or fast), and vocal fry (presence or absence). Listener judgments of ratings of intelligence and likability were collected from 463 adults via online crowdsourcing.\nGeneralized estimating equation models revealed significant three-way interactions between the voice pitch, speech rate, and vocal fry for listener judgments of intelligence and likability. While vocal fry had favorable effects in some contexts (eg, high pitch, fast rate) it had unfavorable effects in others (eg, low pitch, fast rate).\nListener judgments of young American women based on information afforded in their speech are not solely based on the presence or absence of vocal fry, but rather a combination of features that interact with one another in unique ways. Thus, whether or not the use of vocal fry in this population projects a favorable impression depends on the acoustic-prosodic context in which it is produced.", "Continuous monitoring of the Earth radiation budget (ERB) is critical to our understanding of the Earth's climate and its variability with time. The Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) instrument is able to provide a long record of ERB for such scientific studies. This manuscript, which is first of a two-part paper, describes the new CERES algorithm for improving the clear/cloudy scene classification without the use of coincident cloud imager data. This new CERES algorithm is based on a subset of modern artificial intelligence (AI) paradigm called Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. This paper describes development and application of the ML algorithm known as Random Forests (RF) which is used to classify CERES broadband footprint measurements into clear and cloudy scenes. Results from the RF analysis carried using the CERES Single Scanner Footprint (SSF) data for the months of January and July are presented in the manuscript. The daytime RF misclassification rate (MCR) shows relatively large values (>30%) for snow, sea ice and bright desert surface types while lower values of (<10%) for forest surface type. MCR values observed for the nighttime data in general show relatively larger values for most of the surface types compared to the daytime MCR values. The modified MCR values show lower values (< 4%) for most surface types after thin cloud data is excluded from the analysis. Sensitivity analysis shows that the number of input variables and decision trees used in the RF analysis has substantial influence in determining the classification error.", "This study examined the additive and interactive effects of role stress and emotional intelligence for predicting engagement among 288 teachers. Emotional intelligence and engagement were positively associated. Role ambiguity and role conflict showed negative associations with vigor and dedication scores. The interaction of role ambiguity and emotional intelligence was significant in explaining engagement dimensions. Similar results were found considering overall teacher engagement. Emotional intelligence boosted engagement when the levels of role ambiguity were higher. Our findings suggest the need for future research examining the impact of job hindrances on the links between emotional intelligence and teachers' occupational well-being indicators. Finally, the implications for emotional intelligence training in education are discussed.", "A spinlike model mimicking human behavior in groups is employed to investigate the dynamics of the decision-making process. Within the model, the temporal evolution of the state of systems is governed by a time-continuous Markov chain. The transition rates of the resulting master equation are defined in terms of the change of interaction energy between the neighboring agents (change of the level of conflict) and the change of a locally defined agent fitness. Three control parameters can be identified: (i) the social interaction strength \u03b2J measured in units of social temperature, (ii) the level of confidence \u03b2^{'} that each individual has on his own expertise, and (iii) the level of knowledge p that identifies the expertise of each member. Based on these three parameters, the phase diagrams of the system show that a critical transition front exists where a sharp and concurrent change in fitness and consensus takes place. We show that at the critical front, the information leakage from the fitness landscape to the agents is maximized. This event triggers the emergence of the collective intelligence of the group, and in the end it leads to a dramatic improvement in the decision-making performance of the group. The effect of size M of the system is also investigated, showing that, depending on the value of the control parameters, increasing M may be either beneficial or detrimental.", "Most conventional measures of information processing speed require motor responses to facilitate performance. However, although not often addressed clinically, motor impairment, whether due to age or acquired brain injury, would be expected to confound the outcome measure of such tasks. The current study recruited 29 patients (20 stroke and 9 transient ischemic attack) with documented reduction in dexterity of the dominant hand, and 29 controls, to investigate the extent to which 3 commonly used processing speed measures with varying motor demands (a Visuo-Motor Reaction Time task, and the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-IV Symbol Search and Coding subtests) may be measuring motor-related speed more so than cognitive speed. Analyses include correlations between indices of cognitive and motor speed obtained from two other tasks (Inspection Time and Pegboard task, respectively) with the three speed measures, followed by hierarchical regressions to determine the relative contribution of cognitive and motor speed indices toward task performance. Results revealed that speed outcomes on tasks with relatively high motor demands, such as Coding, were largely reflecting motor speed in individuals with reduced dominant hand dexterity. Thus, findings indicate the importance of employing measures with minimal motor requirements, especially when the assessment of speed is aimed at understanding cognitive rather than physical function.", "Flame retardants are commonly used in consumer products found in U.S. households. Restrictions on the use of polybrominated diphenyl ether flame retardants have resulted in increased use of replacement chemicals, including Firemaster 550\u00ae (FM 550\u00ae) and organophosphate flame retardants (PFRs): tris(1,3- dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate (TDCIPP); tris(chloropropyl) phosphate (TCIPP); tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP); and triphenyl phosphate (TPHP). Animal research suggests that PFRs may affect neurodevelopment through noncholinergic mechanisms similar to some organophosphate (OP) pesticides. Despite the widespread presence of these compounds in home environments, and their structural similarity to neurotoxic OP pesticides, understanding of human exposure and health effects of PFRs is limited. We measured four urinary PFR metabolites from pregnant women in the CHAMACOS birth cohort study (n\u00a0=\u00a0310) and assessed neurodevelopment of their children at age 7. Metabolites of TDCIPP (BDCIPP: bis(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate) and TPHP (DPHP: diphenyl phosphate) were detected in >75% of urine samples, and isopropylphenyl phenyl phosphate (ip-PPP), a metabolite of one component of FM 550\u00ae, was detected in 72% of urine samples. We observed decreases of 2.9 points (95% Confidence Interval (CI):\u00a0-6.3, 0.5) and 3.9 points (95% CI:\u00a0-7.3,-0.5) in Full-Scale intelligence quotient and Working Memory, respectively, for each ten-fold increase in DPHP in adjusted regression models (n\u00a0=\u00a0248). Decreases in Full-Scale IQ and Working Memory were greater in models of the molar sum of the PFR metabolites compared to the DPHP models. This is the first study to examine PFR and FM 550\u00ae exposures and potential neurodevelopmental outcomes in pregnant women and children. Additional research is warranted.", "Radiologists are among the first physicians to be directly affected by advances in computer technology. Computers are already capable of analyzing medical imaging data, and with decades worth of digital information available for training, will an artificial intelligence (AI) one day signal the end of the human radiologist? With the ever increasing work load combined with the looming doctor shortage, radiologists will be pushed far beyond their current estimated 3\u2009s allotted time-of-analysis per image; an AI with super-human capabilities might seem like a logical replacement. We feel, however, that AI will lead to an augmentation rather than a replacement of the radiologist. The AI will be relied upon to handle the tedious, time-consuming tasks of detecting and segmenting outliers while possibly generating new, unanticipated results that can then be used as sources of medical discovery. This will affect not only radiologists but all physicians and also researchers dealing with medical imaging. Therefore, we must embrace future technology and collaborate interdisciplinary to spearhead the next revolution in medicine.", "We investigated the cross-sectional and prospective associations between different sedentary behaviors and cognitive function in a large sample of adults with data stored in the UK Biobank. Baseline data were available for 502,643 participants (2006-2010, United Kingdom). Cognitive tests included prospective memory (baseline only: n = 171,585), visual-spatial memory (round 1: n = 483,832; round 2: n = 482,762), fluid intelligence (n = 165,492), and short-term numeric memory (n = 50,370). After a mean period of 5.3 years, participants (numbering from 12,091 to 114,373, depending on the test) also provided follow-up cognitive data. Sedentary behaviors (television viewing, driving, and nonoccupational computer-use time) were measured at baseline. At baseline, both television viewing and driving time were inversely associated with cognitive function across all outcomes (e.g., for each additional hour spent watching television, the total number of correct answers in the fluid intelligence test was 0.15 (99% confidence interval: 0.14, 0.16) lower. Computer-use time was positively associated with cognitive function across all outcomes. Both television viewing and driving time at baseline were positively associated with the odds of having cognitive decline at follow-up across most outcomes. Conversely, computer-use time at baseline was inversely associated with the odds of having cognitive decline at follow-up across most outcomes. This study supports health policies designed to reduce television viewing and driving in adults.", "The pedagogical beliefs (e.g., beliefs or \"mindsets\" concerning the malleability of intelligence) that teachers hold may have a far-reaching impact on their teaching behavior. In general, two basic mindsets can be distinguished with regard to the malleability of intelligence: fixed (entity) and growth (incremental). In this article, we present two studies investigating the associations between teachers' mindset and (1) their appraisal of students' achievements and (2) the feedback they provide. Study 1 focuses on the associations between mindset and appraisal. The findings reveal an association between growth mindset and the appraisal of increasing student achievements. Study 2 investigates the impact of teachers' mindset on the amount and type of oral feedback they provide to their students. Contrarily to expectations, the findings reveal a significant negative correlation between mindset and the amount of feedback.", "Breeding programs currently use statistical analysis to assist in the identification of superior genotypes at various stages of a cultivar's development. Differently from these analyses, the computational intelligence approach has been little explored in genetic improvement of cotton. Thus, this study was carried out with the objective of presenting the use of artificial neural networks as auxiliary tools in the improvement of the cotton to improve fiber quality. To demonstrate the applicability of this approach, this research was carried out using the evaluation data of 40 genotypes. In order to classify the genotypes for fiber quality, the artificial neural networks were trained with replicate data of 20 genotypes of cotton evaluated in the harvests of 2013/14 and 2014/15, regarding fiber length, uniformity of length, fiber strength, micronaire index, elongation, short fiber index, maturity index, reflectance degree, and fiber quality index. This quality index was estimated by means of a weighted average on the determined score (1 to 5) of each characteristic of the HVI evaluated, according to its industry standards. The artificial neural networks presented a high capacity of correct classification of the 20 selected genotypes based on the fiber quality index, so that when using fiber length associated with the short fiber index, fiber maturation, and micronaire index, the artificial neural networks presented better results than using only fiber length and previous associations. It was also observed that to submit data of means of new genotypes to the neural networks trained with data of repetition, provides better results of classification of the genotypes. When observing the results obtained in the present study, it was verified that the artificial neural networks present great potential to be used in the different stages of a genetic improvement program of the cotton, aiming at the improvement of the fiber quality of the future cultivars.", "Decision-making is complex in modern medicine and should ideally be based on available data, structured knowledge and proper interpretation in the context of an individual patient. Automated algorithms, also termed artificial intelligence that are able to extract meaningful patterns from data collections and build decisions upon identified patterns may be useful assistants in clinical decision-making processes. In this article, artificial intelligence-based studies in clinical cardiology are reviewed. The text also touches on the ethical issues and speculates on the future roles of automated algorithms versus clinicians in cardiology and medicine in general.", "The Influence of Media Consumption During Early Childhood on Media Use and Psychological Disorders in Adolescence There are many studies that suggest that there is a link between high media consumption and psychological, physiological and social disorders. Nevertheless, there are also inconsistent results, methodical limitations and a lack of longitudinal studies. The present study analyses habits of media consumption in children and adolescents, the influence of different early childhood risk factors on the use of the media in adolescence and the links between early childhood media consumption and disorders in adolescence. The source of the data is the longitudinal project Future Family III. 249 families participated in the last data collection in the adolescence. Adolescents use the media more than five hours per day on average, nearly fifty percent of these adolescents can be considered as internet addicted and a majority consumes violent contents. A low socioeconomic status, low socio-emotional competences and low intelligence of the child as well as unfavorable educational style and psychological stress of the mother are risk factors for the media use in adolescence. Adolescents with a migration background have an increased risk of internet and computer game dependency. On the other hand, the overall utilization of media in the early childhood has only a low predictive power. The results indicate that these connections seem to be more complex than assumed. There is a need for more longitudinal studies in order to get a better understanding of the consequences of media consumption.", "The Care Quality Commission (CQC) is responsible for ensuring the quality of healthcare in England. To that end, CQC has developed statistical surveillance tools that periodically aggregate large numbers of quantitative performance measures to identify risks to the quality of care and prioritise its limited inspection resource. These tools have, however, failed to successfully identify poor-quality providers. Facing continued budget cuts, CQC is now further reliant on an 'intelligence-driven', risk-based approach to prioritising inspections and a new effective tool is required.\nTo determine whether the near real-time, automated collection and aggregation of multiple sources of patient feedback can provide a collective judgement that effectively identifies risks to the quality of care, and hence can be used to help prioritise inspections.\nOur Patient Voice Tracking System combines patient feedback from NHS Choices, Patient Opinion, Facebook and Twitter to form a near real-time collective judgement score for acute hospitals and trusts on any given date. The predictive ability of the collective judgement score is evaluated through a logistic regression analysis of the relationship between the collective judgement score on the start date of 456 hospital and trust-level inspections, and the subsequent inspection outcomes.\nAggregating patient feedback increases the volume and diversity of patient-centred insights into the quality of care. There is a positive association between the resulting collective judgement score and subsequent inspection outcomes (OR for being rated 'Inadequate' compared with 'Requires improvement' 0.35 (95% CI 0.16 to 0.76), Requires improvement/Good OR 0.23 (95% CI 0.12 to 0.44), and Good/Outstanding OR 0.13 (95% CI 0.02 to 0.84), with p<0.05 for all).\nThe collective judgement score can successfully identify a high-risk group of organisations for inspection, is available in near real time and is available at a more granular level than the majority of existing data sets. The collective judgement score could therefore be used to help prioritise inspections.", "The psychologist, Alfred Binet, who worked under the supervision of Prof. Charcot at the end of the 19th century, made several important contributions to neuropsychology, in partnership with Th\u00e9odore Simon. Most notable among these was the development of intelligence testing scales.", "High-flow bypass followed by ligation of the internal carotid artery (ICA) is an effective treatment, but the impact of abrupt occlusion of the ICA is unpredictable, especially on postoperative cognitive function. The present study evaluated the clinical results as well as cognitive performances after high-flow bypass using radial artery graft (RAG) with supportive superficial temporal artery (STA)-middle cerebral artery (MCA) bypass, followed by ICA ligation. Ten consecutive patients underwent high-flow bypass surgery for large or giant ICA aneurysms of cavernous or cervical portion. Demographics, clinical information, magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, computed tomography, digital subtraction angiography (DSA), intraoperative somatosensory evoked potentials, neuropsychological examinations including the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Third Edition and the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised (WMS-R), and follow-up data were analyzed. The aneurysm was located on the cavernous segment in eight cases and cervical segment in two cases, and mean aneurysm size was 27.9\u00a0mm. Postoperative DSA demonstrated robust bypass flow from the external carotid artery to MCA via the RAG, and no anterograde flow into the aneurysm. No patient showed new symptoms after the operation. Follow-up clinical study and MR imaging were performed in nine patients and showed no additional ischemic lesion compared with preoperative imaging. Seven patients completed neuropsychological examinations before and after surgery. All postoperative scores except WMS-R composite memory score slightly improved. High-flow bypass followed by ICA ligation can achieve good clinical outcomes. Successful high-flow bypass using RAG with supportive STA-MCA bypass and ICA ligation does not adversely affect postoperative cognitive function.", "The neuropsychological construct of executive functions (EFs), and the psychometric Cattell-Horn-Carroll (CHC) theory of cognitive abilities are both approaches that attempt to describe cognitive functioning. The coherence between EF and CHC abilities has been mainly studied using factor-analytical techniques. Through multivariate regression analysis, the current study now assesses the integration of these latent constructs in clinical assessment. The predictive power of six widely used executive tasks on five CHC measures (crystallized and fluid intelligence, visual processing, short-term memory, and processing speed) is examined. Results indicate that executive tasks-except for the Stroop and the Tower of London-predict overall performance on the intelligence tests. Differentiation in predicting performance between the CHC abilities is limited, due to a high shared variance between these abilities. It is concluded that executive processes such as planning and inhibition have a unique variance that is not well-represented in intelligence tests. Implications for the use of EF tests and operationalization of CHC measures in clinical practice are discussed.", "Some evidence suggests that fluoride may be neurotoxic to children. Few of the epidemiologic studies have been longitudinal, had individual measures of fluoride exposure, addressed the impact of prenatal exposures or involved more than 100 participants.\nOur aim was to estimate the association of prenatal exposure to fluoride with offspring neurocognitive development.\nWe studied participants from the Early Life Exposures in Mexico to Environmental Toxicants (ELEMENT) project. An ion-selective electrode technique was used to measure fluoride in archived urine samples taken from mothers during pregnancy and from their children when 6-12 y old, adjusted for urinary creatinine and specific gravity, respectively. Child intelligence was measured by the General Cognitive Index (GCI) of the McCarthy Scales of Children's Abilities at age 4 and full scale intelligence quotient (IQ) from the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI) at age 6-12.\nWe had complete data on 299 mother-child pairs, of whom 287 and 211 had data for the GCI and IQ analyses, respectively. Mean (SD) values for urinary fluoride in all of the mothers (n=299) and children with available urine samples (n=211) were 0.90\u2009(0.35)\u2009mg/L and 0.82\u2009(0.38)\u2009mg/L, respectively. In multivariate models we found that an increase in maternal urine fluoride of 0.5mg/L (approximately the IQR) predicted 3.15 (95% CI: -5.42, -0.87) and 2.50 (95% CI -4.12, -0.59) lower offspring GCI and IQ scores, respectively.\nIn this study, higher prenatal fluoride exposure, in the general range of exposures reported for other general population samples of pregnant women and nonpregnant adults, was associated with lower scores on tests of cognitive function in the offspring at age 4 and 6-12 y. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP655.", "Incontinentia pigmenti (IP) is a rare X-linked dominant disorder, in which skin lesions distributed along Blaschko's lines appear shortly after birth. Early lesions which are erythematous/bullous evolve over time into warty lesions, hyperpigmented swirls/macules, and atrophic hypopigmented streaks. Clinical features are heterogeneous. Abnormalities of the teeth, nails, hair, eyes, central nervous system, and breast may also be present. While intelligence is generally normal, varied degrees of intellectual disability/developmental delay have been reported. Lifespan is normal. IP is associated with mutations of the inhibitor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B cell, kinase gamma (IKBKG) gene on chromosome Xq28. This gene is involved in the activation of nuclear factor kappa B which protects cells against apoptosis; therefore, cells with IKBKG mutations are extremely susceptible to apoptosis. X-linked dominant disorders are lethal to male fetuses. Males who survive with IP either have mosaicism or an additional X chromosome (Klinefelter syndrome). We present a 22-month-old boy with IP and Klinefelter syndrome.", "The Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) has been used extensively to study intellectual abilities of special groups. Here, we report the results of an intellectually gifted group on the WAIS-IV. Gifted individuals are people who obtained scores equal to or greater than 2 standard deviations above the mean on an intelligence test. Hence, the current study aims first, to examine mean group performance data of gifted individuals on the WAIS-IV; second, to revalidate the pattern of performance identified in this special group in previous studies (i.e., verbal skills higher than all other abilities); third, to compare scatter measures across intellectual domains with a matched comparison group. A total of 130 gifted individuals (79 males) were administered the full battery and their performance was compared with a matched comparison group. Analyses revealed that gifted group displayed higher scores in all intellectual domains. Contrary to expectations, they showed the highest scores in perceptual reasoning tasks. A multivariate approach revealed that this ability was statistically different from all other domains within the gifted group. Moreover, gifted individuals showed higher discrepancies across intellectual domains than average-intelligence people. Findings have important practical implications to detect intellectual giftedness in adulthood.", "Lead produces numerous biochemical and physiological changes in humans, including hematological disorders, toxic effects on the central nervous system and in the function of several organs. The aim of this study was to determine blood lead levels (BLL) in children from Cartagena, Colombia, associating those with hematological and liver damage markers, the intelligence quotient (IQ), as well as with gene expression of the aminolevulinate dehydratase (ALAD), superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), gamma interferon (INF-\u03b3), tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and tumor protein (p53). To achieve this purpose, 118 blood samples were collected from children 5-16 years old, with their respective informed consent from their parents. BLL was measured by atomic absorption; hematological parameters were obtained with automated systems; plasma was utilized to analyze hepatic toxicity markers, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), gamma-glutamyltransferase (\u03b3-GT) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP); the Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test (K-BIT) was administered to measure the IQ; and gene expression was quantified from blood RNA. The mean BLL was 1.7\u00b10.3\u03bcg/dL. A low proportion of the children (3.4%) had BLL above the CDC recommended limit (5\u03bcg/dL). BLL were correlated weakly, but negatively with child age, weight, height, body mass index, platelets wide distribution, mean platelet volume, \u03b3-GT and IQ. There were not significant changes in the expression of evaluated genes. These results support the hypothesis that BLL below 5\u03bcg/dL may still be a detrimental factor on children's cognitive abilities, development and hematology, in line with recent concerns that there is no safe level of pediatric lead exposure.", "The increased technological developments in Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) combined with artificial intelligence and Machine Learning (ML) approaches have opened the possibility of remote sensing of extensive areas of arid lands. In this paper, a novel approach towards the detection of termite mounds with the use of a UAV, hyperspectral imagery, ML and digital image processing is intended. A new pipeline process is proposed to detect termite mounds automatically and to reduce, consequently, detection times. For the classification stage, several ML classification algorithms' outcomes were studied, selecting support vector machines as the best approach for their role in image classification of pre-existing termite mounds. Various test conditions were applied to the proposed algorithm, obtaining an overall accuracy of 68%. Images with satisfactory mound detection proved that the method is \"resolution-dependent\". These mounds were detected regardless of their rotation and position in the aerial image. However, image distortion reduced the number of detected mounds due to the inclusion of a shape analysis method in the object detection phase, and image resolution is still determinant to obtain accurate results. Hyperspectral imagery demonstrated better capabilities to classify a huge set of materials than implementing traditional segmentation methods on RGB images only.", "Machine learning (ML) is a domain of artificial intelligence that allows computer algorithms to learn from experience without being explicitly programmed.\nTo summarize neurosurgical applications of ML where it has been compared to clinical expertise, here referred to as \"natural intelligence.\"\nA systematic search was performed in the PubMed and Embase databases as of August 2016 to review all studies comparing the performance of various ML approaches with that of clinical experts in neurosurgical literature.\nTwenty-three studies were identified that used ML algorithms for diagnosis, presurgical planning, or outcome prediction in neurosurgical patients. Compared to clinical experts, ML models demonstrated a median absolute improvement in accuracy and area under the receiver operating curve of 13% (interquartile range 4-21%) and 0.14 (interquartile range 0.07-0.21), respectively. In 29 (58%) of the 50 outcome measures for which a P-value was provided or calculated, ML models outperformed clinical experts (P < .05). In 18 of 50 (36%), no difference was seen between ML and expert performance (P > .05), while in 3 of 50 (6%) clinical experts outperformed ML models (P < .05). All 4 studies that compared clinicians assisted by ML models vs clinicians alone demonstrated a better performance in the first group.\nWe conclude that ML models have the potential to augment the decision-making capacity of clinicians in neurosurgical applications; however, significant hurdles remain associated with creating, validating, and deploying ML models in the clinical setting. Shifting from the preconceptions of a human-vs-machine to a human-and-machine paradigm could be essential to overcome these hurdles.", "Patients with intellectual disability (ID) typically exhibit significant defects in both intelligence and adaptive behavior. Aberration of several genes involved in proper progression of mitosis has been reported to underlie ID. Here, we report a new patient with a novel mutation of CHAMP1.\nWhole exome sequencing (WES) analysis was performed. We isolated lymphoblast cells from the CHAMP1 patient and observed chromosome segregation.\nWe identified a de novo frameshift mutation in CHAMP1. We find that these cells exhibit an increase in centrosome number and resulting multipolar spindle formation. The phenotypes observed in the patient's lymphoblastoid cells were presumably because of cytokinesis failure. We also confirm the identical phenotypes in human culture cells depleted of CHAMP1.\nCHAMP1 encodes a protein regulating kinetochore-microtubule attachment and chromosome segregation. These data strongly support that CHAMP1 mutations cause ID, and suggest that CHAMP1 is critical for progression of cytokinesis and maintenance of centrosome number.", "The use of artificial intelligence techniques to find out which Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) promote the development of a disease is one of the features of medical research, as such techniques may potentially aid early diagnosis and help in the prescription of preventive measures. In particular, the aim is to help physicians to identify the relevant SNPs related to Type 2 diabetes, and to build a decision-support tool for risk prediction.\nWe use the Random Forest (RF) technique in order to search for the most important attributes (SNPs) related to diabetes, giving a weight (degree of importance), ranging between 0 and 1, to each attribute. Support Vector Machines and Logistic Regression have also been used since they are two other machine learning techniques that are well-established in the health community. Their performance has been compared to that achieved by RF. Furthermore, the relevance of the attributes obtained through the use of RF has then been used to perform predictions with k-Nearest Neighbour method weighting attributes in the similarity measure according to the relevance of the attributes with RF.\nTesting is performed on a set of 677 subjects. RF is able to handle the complexity of features' interactions, overfitting, and unknown attribute values, providing the SNPs' relevance with an up to 0.89 area under the ROC curve in terms of risk prediction. RF outperforms all the other tested machine learning techniques in terms of prediction accuracy, and in terms of the stability of the estimated relevance of the attributes.\nThe Random Forest is a useful method for learning predictive models and the relevance of SNPs without any underlying assumption.", "In this study, NiO/Rosa Canina-L seeds activated carbon nanocomposite (NiO/ACNC) was prepared by adding dropwise NaOH solution (2mol/L) to raise the suspension pH to around 9 at room temperature under ultrasonic irradiation (200W) as an efficient method and characterized by FE-SEM, FTIR and N2 adsorption-desorption isotherm. The effect of different parameters such as contact time (0-120min), initial metal ion concentration (25-200mg/L), temperature (298, 318 and 333K), amount of adsorbent (0.002-0.007g) and the solution's initial pH (1-7) on the adsorption of Pb (II) was investigated in batch-scale experiments. The equilibrium data were well fitted by Langmuir model type 1 (R2>0.99). The maximum monolayer adsorption capacity (qm) of NiO/ACNC was 1428.57mg/L. Thermodynamic parameters (\u0394G\u00b0, \u0394H\u00b0 and \u0394S\u00b0) were also calculated. The results showed that the adsorption of Pb (II) onto NiO/ACNC was feasible, spontaneous and exothermic under studied conditions. In addition, a fuzzy-logic-based model including multiple inputs and one output was developed to predict the removal efficiency of Pb (II) from aqueous solution. Four input variables including pH, contact time (min), dosage (g) and initial concentration of Pb (II) were fuzzified using an artificial intelligence-based approach. The fuzzy subsets consisted of triangular membership functions with eight levels and a total of 26 rules in the IF-THEN approach which was implemented on a Mamdani-type of fuzzy inference system. Fuzzy data exhibited small deviation with satisfactory coefficient of determination (R2>0.98) that clearly proved very good performance of fuzzy-logic-based model in prediction of removal efficiency of Pb (II). It was confirmed that NiO/ACNC had a great potential as a novel adsorbent to remove Pb (II) from aqueous solution.", "Applying frontal transcortical approach to treat lateral ventricular tumor is one of the most common neurosurgical manipulations. The frontal transcortical approach generally passes through the middle frontal gyrus in which there is no major function involved in the traditional sense. However, current researches have suggested that the prefrontal cortex (PFC) plays a central role in the whole network of the brain cognitive frame. In addition, cognitive function is crucial in growing and developmental stages and essential for the educational achievement, especially for children. Based on this, the authors in this study analyzed cognitive performance change of pediatric patients who had accepted frontal transcortical operation in 1-year follow-up and discussed the possibility of higher cognitive functions of the damaged region.\nIn this single-center study, 15 pediatric patients (median age at surgery, 9.21\u00a0years old; range, 6.42-14.17\u00a0years old) who had been treated with frontal transcortical approach for lateral ventricular tumors were selected as research objects. The cognitive function assessment was conducting by adopting the revised Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-fourth edition (WISC-IV). In addition, the resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (resting-state fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) were carried out to measure the level of co-activation and to explore the functional connectivity between the brain regions at the preoperative period and 1-year follow-up after surgery.\nGTR was achieved in all patients, and all patients were in good condition after surgery. Compared to the preoperative indices of WISC-IV, patients generally had a lower level of indices of the WISC-IV after surgery, for example, the total IQ was declined to M\u00a0=\u00a083.60, SD\u00a0=\u00a09.500 from M\u00a0=\u00a095.33, SD\u00a0=\u00a013.844 within 1\u00a0year convalescence. The data of perceptual reasoning (t\u00a0=\u00a0-\u00a02.392, p\u00a0=\u00a00.016), processing speed (t\u00a0=\u00a0-\u00a02.121, p\u00a0=\u00a00.033), and total IQ (t\u00a0=\u00a0-2.638, p\u00a0=\u00a00.008) before and after surgery showed statistically significance. Furthermore, decreased functional connectivity and disconnected neural fasciculus were revealed by the size of activation regions in the resting-state fMRI and the reconstruction of three-dimensional images of white matter tracts in the DTI pre- and post-operative.\nThe PFC was not regarded as a major functional area in the past, but the researches at present have shown that the interactions between PFC and other posterior brain regions serve as the basis of the higher cognitive functions. According to imaging manifestations and WISC-IV tasks in this paper, we found that the PFC injury caused by the frontal transcortical approach led to damaged brain structure and impaired the performance of cognitive function. On this basis, we detected that the perceptual reasoning and processing speed maybe have more extensive connections with the middle frontal gyrus.", "The rare recessive developmental disorder Trichothiodystrophy (TTD) is characterized by brittle hair and nails. Patients also present a variable set of poorly explained additional clinical features, including ichthyosis, impaired intelligence, developmental delay and anemia. About half of TTD patients are photosensitive due to inherited defects in the DNA repair and transcription factor II H (TFIIH). The pathophysiological contributions of unrepaired DNA lesions and impaired transcription have not been dissected yet. Here, we functionally characterize the consequence of a homozygous missense mutation in the general transcription factor II E, subunit 2 (GTF2E2/TFIIE\u03b2) of two unrelated non-photosensitive TTD (NPS-TTD) families. We demonstrate that mutant TFIIE\u03b2 strongly reduces the total amount of the entire TFIIE complex, with a remarkable temperature-sensitive transcription defect, which strikingly correlates with the phenotypic aggravation of key clinical symptoms after episodes of high fever. We performed induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell reprogramming of patient fibroblasts followed by in vitro erythroid differentiation to translate the intriguing molecular defect to phenotypic expression in relevant tissue, to disclose the molecular basis for some specific TTD features. We observed a clear hematopoietic defect during late-stage differentiation associated with hemoglobin subunit imbalance. These new findings of a DNA repair-independent transcription defect and tissue-specific malfunctioning provide novel mechanistic insight into the etiology of TTD.", "Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) affects millions of people throughout the world. The intermediate stage may go undetected, as it typically is asymptomatic. However, the preferred practice patterns for AMD recommend identifying individuals with this stage of the disease to educate how to monitor for the early detection of the choroidal neovascular stage before substantial vision loss has occurred and to consider dietary supplements that might reduce the risk of the disease progressing from the intermediate to the advanced stage. Identification, though, can be time-intensive and requires expertly trained individuals.\nTo develop methods for automatically detecting AMD from fundus images using a novel application of deep learning methods to the automated assessment of these images and to leverage artificial intelligence advances.\nDeep convolutional neural networks that are explicitly trained for performing automated AMD grading were compared with an alternate deep learning method that used transfer learning and universal features and with a trained clinical grader. Age-related macular degeneration automated detection was applied to a 2-class classification problem in which the task was to distinguish the disease-free/early stages from the referable intermediate/advanced stages. Using several experiments that entailed different data partitioning, the performance of the machine algorithms and human graders in evaluating over 130\u202f000 images that were deidentified with respect to age, sex, and race/ethnicity from 4613 patients against a gold standard included in the National Institutes of Health Age-related Eye Disease Study data set was evaluated.\nAccuracy, receiver operating characteristics and area under the curve, and kappa score.\nThe deep convolutional neural network method yielded accuracy (SD) that ranged between 88.4% (0.5%) and 91.6% (0.1%), the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was between 0.94 and 0.96, and kappa coefficient (SD) between 0.764 (0.010) and 0.829 (0.003), which indicated a substantial agreement with the gold standard Age-related Eye Disease Study data set.\nApplying a deep learning-based automated assessment of AMD from fundus images can produce results that are similar to human performance levels. This study demonstrates that automated algorithms could play a role that is independent of expert human graders in the current management of AMD and could address the costs of screening or monitoring, access to health care, and the assessment of novel treatments that address the development or progression of AMD.", "Case-control studies are used in epidemiology to try to uncover the causes of diseases, but are a retrospective study design known to suffer from non-participation and recall bias, which may explain their decreased popularity in recent years. Traditional analyses report usually only the odds ratio for given exposures and the binary disease status. Chain event graphs are a graphical representation of a statistical model derived from event trees which have been developed in artificial intelligence and statistics, and only recently introduced to the epidemiology literature. They are a modern Bayesian technique which enable prior knowledge to be incorporated into the data analysis using the agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithm, used to form a suitable chain event graph. Additionally, they can account for missing data and be used to explore missingness mechanisms. Here we adapt the chain event graph framework to suit scenarios often encountered in case-control studies, to strengthen this study design which is time and financially efficient. We demonstrate eight adaptations to the graphs, which consist of two suitable for full case-control study analysis, four which can be used in interim analyses to explore biases, and two which aim to improve the ease and accuracy of analyses. The adaptations are illustrated with complete, reproducible, fully-interpreted examples, including the event tree and chain event graph. Chain event graphs are used here for the first time to summarise non-participation, data collection techniques, data reliability, and disease severity in case-control studies. We demonstrate how these features of a case-control study can be incorporated into the analysis to provide further insight, which can help to identify potential biases and lead to more accurate study results.", "Rapid growth of sensor and computing platforms have introduced the wearable systems. In recent years, wearable systems have led to new applications across all medical fields. The aim of this review is to present current state-of-the-art approach in the field of wearable system based cancer detection and identify key challenges that resist it from clinical adoption. A total of 472 records were screened and 11 were finally included in this study. Two types of records were studied in this context that includes 45% research articles and 55% manufactured products. The review was performed per PRISMA guidelines where considerations was given to records that were published or reported between 2009 and 2017. The identified records included 4 cancer detecting wearable systems such as breast cancer (36.3%), skin cancer (36.3%), prostate cancer (18.1%), and multi-type cancer (9%). Most works involved sensor based smart systems comprising of microcontroller, Bluetooth module, and smart phone. Few demonstrated Ultra-Wide Band (i.e. UWB) antenna based wearable systems. Skin cancer detecting wearable systems were most comprehensible ones. The current works are gradually progressing with seamless integration of sensory units along with smart networking. However, they lack in cloud computing and long-range communication paradigms. Artificial intelligence and machine learning are key ports that need to be attached with current wearable systems. Further, clinical inertia, lack of awareness, and high cost are altogether pulling back the actual growth of such system. It is well comprehended that upon sincere orientation of all identified challenges, wearable systems would emerge as vital alternative to futuristic cancer detection.", "This study developed a new hybrid artificial intelligence (AI)-meshless approach for modeling contaminant transport in porous media. The key innovation of the proposed approach is that both black box and physically-based models are combined for modeling contaminant transport. The effectiveness of the approach was evaluated using experimental and real world data. Artificial neural network (ANN) and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) were calibrated to predict temporal contaminant concentrations (CCs), and the effect of noisy and de-noised data on the model performance was evaluated. Then, considering the predicted CCs at test points (TPs, in experimental study) and piezometers (in Myandoab plain) as interior conditions, the multiquadric radial basis function (MQ-RBF), as a meshless approach which solves partial differential equation (PDE) of contaminant transport in porous media, was employed to estimate the CC values at any point within the study area where there was no TP or piezometer. Optimal values of the dispersion coefficient in the advection-dispersion PDE and shape coefficient of MQ-RBF were determined using the imperialist competitive algorithm. In temporal contaminant transport modeling, de-noised data enhanced the performance of ANN and ANFIS methods in terms of the determination coefficient, up to 6 and 5%, respectively, in the experimental study and up to 39 and 18%, respectively, in the field study. Results showed that the efficiency of ANFIS-meshless model was more than ANN-meshless model up to 2 and 13% in the experimental and field studies, respectively.", "Non-pharmacological interventions are increasingly being acknowledged as valuable treatment options to overcome or reduce functional problems in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). There is a wide range of such non-pharmacological treatments for which the supportive evidence is emerging. Physiotherapy is one good example in this domain. However, there are also several promising non-pharmacological treatment strategies that have thus far received less research attention. Here, we describe two relatively new, but encouraging approaches. First, we focus on a hitherto largely overseen subgroup of PD, namely those with late-stage disease, a population that is often excluded from clinical studies. Importantly, the aims and therapeutic strategies in late-stage PD differ considerably from those in early-stage PD, and an emphasis on non-pharmacological management is particularly important for this vulnerable subgroup. Second, we focus on computer-based cognitive training, as an example of a relatively new intervention that includes innovative elements such as personalized training, artificial intelligence, and virtual reality. We review the latest evidence, practical considerations and future research perspectives, both for non-pharmacological approaches in late-stage PD and for computer-based cognitive training.", "In preterm children with very low birth weight (VLBW \u2264 1500 g), reading problems are often observed. Reading comprehension is dependent on word decoding and language comprehension. We investigated neural activation-within brain regions important for reading-related to components of reading comprehension in young VLBW adolescents in direct comparison to normal birth weight (NBW) term-born peers, with the use of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We hypothesized that the decoding mechanisms will be affected by VLBW, and expect to see increased neural activity for VLBW which may be modulated by task performance and cognitive ability. The study investigated 13 (11 included in fMRI) young adolescents (ages 12 to 14 years) born preterm with VLBW and in 13 NBW controls (ages 12-14 years) for performance on the Block Design and Vocabulary subtests of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children; and for semantic, orthographic, and phonological processing during an fMRI paradigm. The VLBW group showed increased phonological activation in left inferior frontal gyrus, decreased orthographic activation in right supramarginal gyrus, and decreased semantic activation in left inferior frontal gyrus. Block Design was related to altered right-hemispheric activation, and VLBW showed lower WISC Block Design scores. Left angular gyrus showed activation increase specific for VLBW with high accuracy on the semantic test. Young VLBW adolescents showed no accuracy and reaction time performance differences on our fMRI language tasks, but they did exhibit altered neural activation during these tasks. This altered activation for VLBW was observed as increased activation during phonological decoding, and as mainly decreased activation during orthographic and semantic processing. Correlations of neural activation with accuracy on the semantic fMRI task and with decreased WISC Block Design performance were specific for the VLBW group. Together, results suggest compensatory mechanisms by recruiting additional brain regions upon altered neural development of decoding for VLBW.", "This study explored developmental and individual differences in intellectual humility (IH) among 127 children ages 6-8. IH was operationalized as children's assessment of their knowledge and willingness to delegate scientific questions to experts. Children completed measures of IH, theory of mind, motivational framework, and intelligence, and neurophysiological measures indexing early (error-related negativity [ERN]) and later (error positivity [Pe]) error-monitoring processes related to cognitive control. Children's knowledge self-assessment correlated with question delegation, and older children showed greater IH than younger children. Greater IH was associated with higher intelligence but not with social cognition or motivational framework. ERN related to self-assessment, whereas Pe related to question delegation. Thus, children show separable epistemic and social components of IH that may differentially contribute to metacognition and learning.", "Reaction time (RT) has played a prominent part in research on mental ability for over a century. Throughout this time a number of questions have been repeatedly posed: what is the relationship of RT to general mental ability, and is this the same for simple and choice RT? Does the relationship change with age? How important is RT variability compared with mean values? Here we examine these questions in three population representative cohorts.\nParticipants were drawn from the West of Scotland Twenty-07 study, a longitudinal population based study designed to investigate socially structured health inequalities. At the fourth wave of data collection, part I of the Alice Heim 4 (AH4) test of general intelligence was administered, and reaction times were measured using a portable device. Means and standard deviations were recorded for simple and 4-choice reaction time. Full data were available for 2196 participants, comprising 714 aged 30\u00a0years, 813 aged 50, and 669 aged 69.\nCorrelations of simple RT means with AH4 scores were -\u00a00.27, -\u00a00.30 and -\u00a00.32, for age 30, 50 and 69, respectively; and -\u00a00.44, -\u00a00.47 and -\u00a00.53 for 4-choice RT. The underlying relationships showed evidence of non-linearity, particularly for simple RT, with stronger association at lower AH4 scores. This was more pronounced with age. RT variability was correlated with the mean at 0.57, 0.57, 0.58 for simple RT; and 0.53, 0.53, 0.47 for choice RT. Residuals from regressing the RT variability on the mean showed no association with AH4 in the case of simple RT but a weak association for choice RT which decreased with age.\nThere is a strong correlation of RT means with general mental ability which increases with age. The underlying relationship is complex for SRT. RT variability shows little association with mental ability when its dependence on the mean is removed. Combining samples with disparate ages may overestimate the association.", "We comment on a paper describing an algorithm for image set classification. Following the general practice in computer vision research, the performance of the algorithm was evaluated on benchmarks in order to support the claim of its advantage over other algorithms in the literature. We have examined the reported data of experiences on two datasets, and found that many numbers are not a possible answer regardless how the random partitions were selected and regardless how the algorithms performed in each partition. Our finding suggests that the experimental results in the paper (\"Deep Reconstruction Models for Image Set Classification\", IEEE Trans. Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, vol.\u00a037, no.\u00a04, pp. 713-727, April 2015) has serious flaws to the extent that all the experimental results should be re-examined.", "The relevance of assessing cognitive functioning is increasing against the background of the continuing demographic changes. Up to a few years ago the focus was on the effects of cochlear implantation in children born deaf in comparison to healthy individuals. Currently, the question arises whether hearing rehabilitation in the elderly, e.g. by postlingual cochlear implantation, has a protective effect on cognitive functioning and therefore on the risk of onset of dementia. This review describes the association of cognitive functioning with hearing disorders and cochlear implantation. Historical aspects of intelligence testing are illustrated. Knowledge on cognitive aspects in elderly persons with hearing disorders and cochlear implants is rare in the currently available literature. Initial findings indicate a\u00a0positive correlation between hearing improvement and cognitive functioning. Further studies are urgently required in order to elucidate appropriate guidelines for the treatment of patients with cognitive deficits and hearing impairment.", "To examine the efficacy of a multi-modal web-based therapy program, Move it to improve it (Mitii\u2122) delivered at home to improve Executive Functioning (EF) in children with an acquired brain injury (ABI).\nRandomised Waitlist controlled trial.\nHome environment.\nSixty children with an ABI were matched in pairs by age and intelligence quotient then randomised to either 20-weeks of Mitii\u2122 training or 20 weeks of Care As Usual (waitlist control; n=30; 17 males; mean age=11y, 11m (\u00b12y, 6m); Full Scale IQ=76.24\u00b117.84). Fifty-eight children completed baseline assessments (32 males; mean age=11.87\u00b12.47; Full Scale IQ=75.21\u00b116.76).\nExecutive functioning was assessed on four domains: attentional control, cognitive flexibility, goal setting, and information processing using subtests from the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC-IV), Delis-Kaplan Executive Functioning System (D-KEFS), Comprehensive Trail Making Test (CTMT), Tower of London (TOL), and Test of Everyday Attention for Children (Tea-Ch). Executive functioning performance in everyday life was assessed via parent questionnaire (Behaviour Rating Inventory of Executive Functioning; BRIEF).\nNo differences were observed at baseline measures. Groups were compared at 20-weeks using linear regression with no significant differences found between groups on all measures of EF. Out of a potential total dose of 60 hours, children in the Mitii\u2122 group completed a mean of 17 hours of Mitii\u2122 intervention.\nResults indicate no additional benefit to receiving Mitii\u2122 compared to standard care. Mitii\u2122, in its current form, was not shown to improve EF in children with ABI.", "Both physician and patient race-related beliefs and attitudes are contributors to racial healthcare disparities, but only the former have received substantial research attention. Using data from a study conducted in the Midwestern US from 2012 to 2014, we investigated whether 114 Black cancer patients' existing race-related beliefs and attitudes would predict how they and 18 non-Black physicians (medical oncologists) would respond in subsequent clinical interactions.\nAt least two days before interacting with an oncologist for initial discussions of treatment options, patients completed measures of perceived past discrimination, general mistrust of physicians, and suspicion of healthcare systems; interactions were video-recorded. Measures from each interaction included patients' verbal behavior (e.g., level of verbal activity), patients' evaluations of physicians (e.g., trustworthiness), patients' perceptions of recommended treatments (e.g., confidence in treatment), physicians' evaluations of patient personal attributes (e.g., intelligence) and physicians' expectations for patient treatment success (e.g., adherence).\nAs predicted, patients' race-related beliefs and attitudes differed in their associations with patient and physician responses to the interactions. Higher levels of perceived past discrimination predicted more patient verbal activity. Higher levels of mistrust also predicted less patient positive affect and more negative evaluations of physicians. Higher levels of suspicion predicted more negative evaluations of physicians and recommended treatments. Stronger patient race-related attitudes were directly or indirectly associated with lower physician perceptions of patient attributes and treatment expectations.\nResults provide new evidence for the role of Black patients' race-related beliefs and attitudes in racial healthcare disparities and suggest the need to measure multiple beliefs and attitudes to identify these effects.", "Childhood brain tumors and related treatments disrupt the developing brain and have a cascading impact on core cognitive skills and intellectual (intelligence quotient [IQ]) and academic achievement outcomes. Theoretical models for this cascade have been developed based on the literature, but no studies thus far have empirically evaluated the models. The current study aimed to empirically test the two extant models and generate a new data-driven model of the relationships among neurodevelopmental risk factors, core cognitive skills (i.e., processing speed, attention span, working memory), and IQ and achievement outcomes. Fifty-seven adult survivors of childhood brain tumors and fifty-seven demographically matched neurotypical individuals were included in the current study. The average age at brain tumor diagnosis was 8\u00a0years, and the average time since diagnosis was 17\u00a0years. Three a priori path models tested the hypothesized relationships among variables. Results of the path analyses revealed that the hybrid model best fit the data for both survivors and controls based on all statistical criteria. For survivors, processing speed was the core cognitive skill most widely associated with neurodevelopmental risk factors and outcomes. However, working memory and attention span also had unique contributions to IQ and academic achievement. Processing speed appears to be the central cognitive skill that disrupts the other core cognitive skills of attention span and working memory, and all three make a unique contribution to IQ and academic achievement. This is best demonstrated by a novel neurodevelopmental model that combines components of two earlier untested theoretical models.", "Food-animal production businesses are part of a data-driven ecosystem shaped by stringent requirements for traceability along the value chain and the expanding capabilities of connected products. Within this sector, the generation of animal health intelligence, in particular, in terms of antimicrobial usage, is hindered by the lack of a centralized framework for data storage and usage. In this Perspective, we delimit the 11 processes required for evidence-based decisions and explore processes 3 (digital data acquisition) to 10 (communication to decision-makers) in more depth. We argue that small agribusinesses disproportionally face challenges related to economies of scale given the high price of equipment and services. There are two main areas of concern regarding the collection and usage of digital farm data. First, recording platforms must be developed with the needs and constraints of small businesses in mind and move away from local data storage, which hinders data accessibility and interoperability. Second, such data are unstructured and exhibit properties that can prove challenging to its near real-time preprocessing and analysis in a sector that is largely lagging behind others in terms of computing infrastructure and buying into digital technologies. To complete the digital transformation of this sector, investment in rural digital infrastructure is required alongside the development of new business models to empower small businesses to commit to near real-time data capture. This approach will deliver critical information to fill gaps in our understanding of emerging diseases and antimicrobial resistance in production animals, eventually leading to effective evidence-based policies.", "The concept of being at risk for psychosis has been introduced both for adults and children and adolescents, but fewer studies have been conducted in the latter population. The aim of this study is to systematically review the articles associated with clinical description, interventions, outcome and other areas in children and adolescents at risk for psychosis. We searched in MEDLINE/PubMed and PsycINFO databases for articles published up to 30/06/16. Reviewed articles were prospective studies; written in English; original articles with Clinical High Risk (CHR) for psychosis samples; and mean age of samples younger than 18\u00a0years. From 103 studies initially selected, 48 met inclusion criteria and were systematically reviewed. Studies show that CHR children and adolescents present several clinical characteristics at baseline, with most attenuated positive-symptom inclusion criteria observed, reporting mostly perceptual abnormalities and suspiciousness, and presenting comorbid conditions such as depressive and anxiety disorders. CHR children and adolescents show lower general intelligence and no structural brain changes compared with controls. Original articles reviewed show rates of conversion to psychosis between 17 and 20% at 1 year follow-up and between 7 and 21% at 2 years. While 36% of patients recovered from their CHR status at 6-year follow-up, 40% still met CHR criteria. Studies in children and adolescents with CHR were conducted with different methodologies, assessments tools and small samples. It is important to conduct studies on psychopharmacological and psychological treatment, as well as replication of the few studies found.", "BackgroundLow-birth-weight infants (LBW) are at an increased risk of iron deficiency that has been associated with impaired neurodevelopment. We hypothesized that iron supplementation of LBW infants improves cognitive scores and reduces behavioral problems until school age.MethodsWe randomized 285 marginally LBW (2,000-2,500\u2009g) infants to receive 0, 1, or 2\u2009mg/kg/day of iron supplements from 6 weeks to 6 months of age. At 7 years of age, 205 participants were assessed regarding cognition using Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC-IV) and behavior using the parental questionnaires Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and Five to Fifteen (FTF).ResultsThere were no significant differences between the intervention groups in WISC-IV or FTF. However, the CBCL scores for externalizing problems were significantly different, in favor of supplemented children (P=0.045). When combining the supplemented groups, they had significantly lower scores for externalizing behavior compared with placebo (median (interquartile range): 44 [34;51] vs. 48.5 [41;56] P=0.013), and their risk ratio (95% confidence interval) for a total behavioral score above the cutoff for clinical problems was 0.31 (0.09-1.0), P=0.054.ConclusionLower scores of externalizing behavior in supplemented children support our previous findings at 3 years, and suggest that iron supplementation may have long-lasting effects on behavioral functions.", "As a recent trend, various computational intelligence and machine learning approaches have been used for mining inferences hidden in the large clinical databases to assist the clinician in strategic decision making. In any target data the irrelevant information may be detrimental, causing confusion for the mining algorithm and degrades the prediction outcome. To address this issue, this study attempts to identify an intelligent approach to assist disease diagnostic procedure using an optimal set of attributes instead of all attributes present in the clinical data set. In this proposed Application Specific Intelligent Computing (ASIC) decision support system, a rough set based genetic algorithm is employed in pre-processing phase and a back propagation neural network is applied in training and testing phase. ASIC has two phases, the first phase handles outliers, noisy data, and missing values to obtain a qualitative target data to generate appropriate attribute reduct sets from the input data using rough computing based genetic algorithm centred on a relative fitness function measure. The succeeding phase of this system involves both training and testing of back propagation neural network classifier on the selected reducts. The model performance is evaluated with widely adopted existing classifiers. The proposed ASIC system for clinical decision support has been tested with breast cancer, fertility diagnosis and heart disease data set from the University of California at Irvine (UCI) machine learning repository. The proposed system outperformed the existing approaches attaining the accuracy rate of 95.33%, 97.61%, and 93.04% for breast cancer, fertility issue and heart disease diagnosis.", "Acute exposure to light within the blue wavelengths has been shown to enhance alertness and vigilance, and lead to improved speed on reaction time tasks, possibly due to activation of the noradrenergic system. It remains unclear, however, whether the effects of blue light extend beyond simple alertness processes to also enhance other aspects of cognition, such as memory performance. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a thirty minute pulse of blue light versus placebo (amber light) exposure in healthy normally rested individuals in the morning during verbal memory consolidation (i.e., 1.5 hours after memory acquisition) using an abbreviated version of the California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT-II). At delayed recall, individuals who received blue light (n = 12) during the consolidation period showed significantly better long-delay verbal recall than individuals who received amber light exposure (n = 18), while controlling for the effects of general intelligence, depressive symptoms and habitual wake time. These findings extend previous work demonstrating the effect of blue light on brain activation and alertness to further demonstrate its effectiveness at facilitating better memory consolidation and subsequent retention of verbal material. Although preliminary, these findings point to a potential application of blue wavelength light to optimize memory performance in healthy populations. It remains to be determined whether blue light exposure may also enhance performance in clinical populations with memory deficits.", "Karinen, Heikki M., and Martti T. Tuomisto. Performance, mood, and anxiety during a climb of Mount Everest. High Alt Med Biol. 18:400-410, 2017.\nVarious studies have shown the deleterious effects of high-altitude hypoxia on visual, motor, somatosensory, cognitive, and emotional function and also in intelligence tests, reaction time, speech comprehension, hand steadiness, visual contrast discrimination, and word association tests. Because optimal cognitive abilities may be crucial for mountain climbers' safety, this study was intended to evaluate the changes in cognitive performance, mood, and anxiety during an Everest expedition lasting almost 3 months.\nA set of physiological (Lake Louise score, oxygen saturation), cognitive (Colorado perceptual speed [CPS] test, number comparison [NC] test), and emotional measurements (Profile of Mood States, anxiety responses, psychological inflexibility) were collected from nine climbers on a partly unsupported Mount Everest expedition at various time points during the course of the expedition at Everest Base Camp (EBC). For confidence intervals we used 95% simultaneous Bonferroni corrected interval (BCI) for the differences.\nDuring this expedition, the estimates of trait anxiety decreased 13% toward the end of expedition after successful summiting (p\u2009=\u20090.004). Simultaneously, fatigue appeared to diminish and the CPS speed results improved 13%. Most expedition members suffered mild symptoms of acute mountain sickness during the first days in the EBC, but this did not affect the speed or the number of mistakes made in the CPS or NC tests. In CPS test the differences between pretest and the physically most demanding period (EBC4, BCI: 0.01, 4.43) and between EBC1 and EBC4 (BCI: 0.57, 4.99), between EBC2 and EBC4 (BCI: 0.45, 4.88), and between EBC3 and EBC4 (BCI: 1.12, 5.55) were significant, showing ever improving results during the expedition.\nThe most important finding in this study was that well-motivated and trained, self-selected individuals, who volunteer for a long-duration mission, are capable of maintaining high levels of performance, steady mood state, and a good level of vigor on a Mount Everest expedition lasting nearly 3 months.", "Concurrent exposure to a wide variety of xenobiotics and their combined toxic effects can play a pivotal role in health and disease, yet are largely unexplored. Investigating the totality of these exposures, i.e., the \"exposome\", and their specific biological effects constitutes a new paradigm for environmental health but still lacks high-throughput, user-friendly technology. We demonstrate the utility of mass spectrometry-based global exposure metabolomics combined with tailored database queries and cognitive computing for comprehensive exposure assessment and the straightforward elucidation of biological effects. The METLIN Exposome database has been redesigned to help identify environmental toxicants, food contaminants and supplements, drugs, and antibiotics as well as their biotransformation products, through its expansion with over 700\u2009000 chemical structures to now include more than 950\u2009000 unique small molecules. More importantly, we demonstrate how the XCMS/METLIN platform now allows for the readout of the biological effect of a toxicant through metabolomic-derived pathway analysis, and further, artificial intelligence provides a means of assessing the role of a potential toxicant. The presented workflow addresses many of the methodological challenges current exposomics research is facing and will serve to gain a deeper understanding of the impact of environmental exposures and combinatory toxic effects on human health.", "Learning disability (LD) has been identified as a potential risk factor for a sport-related concussion, yet students with LD are rarely included in concussion research. Here, we draw special attention to dyslexia, a common but often underdiagnosed LD. Reading and learning problems commonly associated with dyslexia are often masked by protective factors, such as high verbal ability or general intelligence. Hence, high-achieving individuals with dyslexia may not be identified as being in a high-risk category. To ensure that students with dyslexia are included in LD concussion research and identified as LD in baseline testing, we provide athletic trainers with an overview of dyslexia and a preliminary screening protocol that is sensitive to dyslexia, even among academically high-achieving students in secondary school and college.", "Neurodevelopmental outcome of apparently isolated agenesis of the corpus callosum (ACC) remains a major concern with uncertain prognosis. Despite \"normal\" IQ reported in a majority of patients, the rates of learning disabilities and severe outcome (ranging from 0% to 20%) are not clearly established.\nA large population-based series was investigated based on a longitudinal follow-up until school age, using Wechsler Intelligence scales at 3, 5, and 7 years.\nFifty women were referred to a tertiary referral unit for an \"apparently\" isolated ACC confirmed by ultrasound, foetal MRI, and karyotyping or array CGH. Twelve pregnancies were terminated, one foetus died in utero, one pregnancy outcome was unknown, and 36 babies were born. Two were lost to follow-up. Thirty-four children could be classified into three groups. Group 1 comprised two children (6%) with severe intellectual disability (one Mowat-Wilson syndrome and one ASD). Group 2 comprised 10 children (29%) who had learning disabilities and borderline intellectual functioning (VIQ and/or PIQ scores >70 and\u00a0<85); three patients had hypopituitarism with additional MRI anomalies revealed after birth. Group 3 comprised 22 children (65%) who had both VIQ and PIQ >85 (-1 SD) with a normal school level. Longitudinal follow-up revealed weaker PIQ in younger children which improved with age.\nOur data indicate that intellectual ability is normal (IQ\u00a0>\u00a085) in approximately two thirds and borderline in just over a quarter of patients. However, a low risk of severe cognitive impairment exists, and this information should be shared with couples during prenatal counselling.", "The importance of investigating various emotional skills in assessment of suicide risk in alcohol-dependent (AD) individuals has recently become the focus of increasing interest. The objective of this study was to explore the relationships between self-reported components of emotional intelligence and lifetime prevalence of suicide attempts in a clinical sample of AD subjects.\nA group of 80 inpatients entering an alcohol treatment program in Warsaw, Poland, was recruited. Baseline information about demographics, psychopathological symptoms, personality, and severity of alcohol problems was obtained. The Schutte Self-Report Emotional Intelligence Test was utilized for assessment of emotional processing. Lifetime history of suicide attempts was obtained from the MINI International Neuropsychiatric Interview.\nAfter accounting for affect-related suicide risk factors (severity of depression, anxiety, neuroticism), and also other significant predictors (eg, age, sex, history of childhood abuse), mood regulation/optimism deficits remained a significant correlate of lifetime suicide attempts in AD patients. In the mediation models, mood regulation appeared to fully mediate the relationship between history of suicide attempts and depression, and also neuroticism.\nThe results of this study support the evidence that poor mood regulation might be related to the risk for suicidal behavior in AD individuals. These findings point towards the significance of addressing the issue of emotion-related skills in the therapy of those AD subjects who are at risk for suicide.", "Emotional intelligence (EI) has been linked with academic and professional success. Such data are scarce in Sri Lanka. This study was conducted to describe the pattern of EI, to determine its predictors and to determine the effect of EI on academic performance at the final MBBS examination, in medical undergraduates of a Sri Lankan university.\nThis is a cross-sectional study in a selected university, involving those who did final MBBS examination in 2016. Consecutive sampling was done. EI was assessed with self-administered Genos Emotional Intelligence Full Version (7 domains; 70 questions equally weighted; total score 350). Socio-demographic data were obtained using a self-administered questionnaire. Academic performance was assessed with final MBBS results in the first attempt.\nOf 148 eligible students 130 responded (response rate-88%); 61.5% were females; mean age was 26.3\u2009\u00b1\u20091\u00a0years. Mean total EI score was 241.5 (females-245.5, males-235.1; p\u2009=\u20090.045).Among different domains, mean score was highest for Emotional Self-Awareness (36.8/50) and lowest for Emotional Expression (32.6/50). Multiple linear regression analysis indicated that having good family support (p\u2009=\u20090.002), socializing well in university (p\u2009=\u20090.024) and being satisfied with facilities available for learning (p\u2009=\u20090.002), were independent predictors of EI. At the final MBBS examination 51.6% obtained classes, 31.5% passed the examination without classes and 16.9% got repeated. Females had better academic performance than males (p\u2009=\u20090.009). Mean EI of second-class upper division, second-class lower division, pass and repeat groups were 249.4, 246.6, 240.2 and 226.9, respectively (with one-way ANOVA p\u00a0=\u00a00.015). After adjusting for gender, ordinal regression analysis indicated that, total EI score was an independent predictor of final MBBS results [\u03b2-0.018 (95% CI 0.005-0.031); p\u2009=\u20090.006].\nIn the study population, both EI and academic performance were higher among females. Independent of gender, academic performance was better in those who were more emotionally intelligent. Several psychosocial factors were found to be independent predictors of EI. These results suggest that emotional skills development might enhance academic performance of medical undergraduates in Sri Lanka. Further research is needed in this under-explored area.", "The aim of this study is to assess the resting-state functional connectivity (RsFc) profile of the default mode network (DMN) in transition-age males with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Resting-state blood oxygen level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging data were acquired from adolescent and young adult males with high-functioning ASD (n\u2009=\u200915) and from age-, sex-, and intelligence quotient-matched healthy controls (HCs; n\u2009=\u200916). The DMN was examined by assessing the positive and negative RsFc correlations of an average of the literature-based conceptualized major DMN nodes (medial prefrontal cortex [mPFC], posterior cingulate cortex, bilateral angular, and inferior temporal gyrus regions). RsFc data analysis was performed using a seed-driven approach. ASD was characterized by an altered pattern of RsFc in the DMN. The ASD group exhibited a weaker pattern of intra- and extra-DMN-positive and -negative RsFc correlations, respectively. In ASD, the strength of intra-DMN coupling was significantly reduced with the mPFC and the bilateral angular gyrus regions. In addition, the polarity of the extra-DMN correlation with the right hemispheric task-positive regions of fusiform gyrus and supramarginal gyrus was reversed from typically negative to positive in the ASD group. A wide variability was observed in the presentation of the RsFc profile of the DMN in both HC and ASD groups that revealed a distinct pattern of subgrouping using pattern recognition analyses. These findings imply that the functional architecture profile of the DMN is altered in ASD with weaker than expected integration and segregation of DMN RsFc. Future studies with larger sample sizes are warranted.", "Interpretation of mammography for breast cancer (BC) screening can confer a mortality benefit through early BC detection, can miss a cancer that is present or fast growing, or can result in false-positives. Efforts to improve screening outcomes have mostly focused on intensifying imaging practices (double instead of single-reading, more frequent screens, or supplemental imaging) that may add substantial resource expenditures and harms associated with population screening. Less attention has been given to making mammography screening practice 'smarter' or more efficient. Artificial intelligence (AI) is capable of advanced learning using large complex datasets and has the potential to perform tasks such as image interpretation. With both highly-specific capabilities, and also possible un-intended (and poorly understood) consequences, this viewpoint considers the promise and current reality of AI in BC detection.", "Clinical business intelligence tools such as clinical data warehouse enable health care organizations to objectively assess the disease management programs that affect the quality of patients' life and well-being in public. The purpose of these programs is to reduce disease occurrence, improve patient care, and decrease health care costs. Therefore, applying clinical data warehouse can be effective in generating useful information about aspects of patient care to facilitate budgeting, planning, research, process improvement, external reporting, benchmarking, and trend analysis, as well as to enable the decisions needed to prevent the progression or appearance of the illness aligning with maintaining the health of the population. The aim of this review article is to describe the benefits of clinical data warehouse applications in creating intelligence for disease management programs.", "Pediatric central auditory processing disorder (CAPD) is frequently comorbid with other childhood disorders. However, few studies have examined the relationship between commonly used CAPD, language, and cognition tests within the same sample.\nThe present study examined the relationship between diagnostic CAPD tests and \"gold standard\" measures of language and cognitive ability, the Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals (CELF) and the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC).\nA retrospective study.\nTwenty-seven patients referred for CAPD testing who scored average or better on the CELF and low average or better on the WISC were initially included. Seven children who scored below the CELF and/or WISC inclusion criteria were then added to the dataset for a second analysis, yielding a sample size of 34.\nParticipants were administered a CAPD battery that included at least the following three CAPD tests: Frequency Patterns (FP), Dichotic Digits (DD), and Competing Sentences (CS). In addition, they were administered the CELF and WISC. Relationships between scores on CAPD, language (CELF), and cognition (WISC) tests were examined using correlation analysis.\nDD and FP showed significant correlations with Full Scale Intelligence Quotient, and the DD left ear and the DD interaural difference measures both showed significant correlations with working memory. However, \u223c80% or more of the variance in these CAPD tests was unexplained by language and cognition measures. Language and cognition measures were more strongly correlated with each other than were the CAPD tests with any CELF or WISC scale. Additional correlations with the CAPD tests were revealed when patients who scored in the mild-moderate deficit range on the CELF and/or in the borderline low intellectual functioning range on the WISC were included in the analysis.\nWhile both the DD and FP tests showed significant correlations with one or more cognition measures, the majority of the variance in these CAPD measures went unexplained by cognition. Unlike DD and FP, the CS test was not correlated with cognition. Additionally, language measures were not significantly correlated with any of the CAPD tests. Our findings emphasize that the outcomes and interpretation of results vary as a function of the subject inclusion criteria that are applied for the CELF and WISC. Including participants with poorer cognition and/or language scores increased the number of significant correlations observed. For this reason, it is important that studies investigating the relationship between CAPD and other domains or disorders report the specific inclusion criteria used for all tests.", "Endometriosis is a disabling and long-term medical condition affecting quality of life and mental health. Behavioral, cognitive, and emotional coping strategies, emotional intelligence, and metacognition could in part explain the link between the disease and impaired psychological and life functioning. This critical narrative review aimed at examining the state of the art of the relationships between endometriosis and these factors. According to PRISMA principles, we performed a systematic search for quantitative and qualitative studies on multiple electronic databases as regards coping strategies, emotional intelligence, and metacognition in women with endometriosis. Studies were subjected to interpretative and critical narrative synthesis. A total of 9 papers were included in the review. Three main categories were identified in thematic analysis and resumed in the manuscript. Findings suggested that (a) pain is considered the major stressor; (b) they usually use both adaptive and maladaptive coping strategies; (c) women with endometriosis and related chronic pain seem to repress emotions more likely than healthy ones; (d) suppressing own emotions, pain catastrophizing, and having a passive coping style are related to higher self-reported pain; and (e) emotional and avoidance coping styles are associated to poor mental status, while positive coping strategies focusing on the problem or on emotions, detached and rational styles are associated to better mental health. Few studies with mixed results and some methodological flaws have focused on coping strategies in women with endometriosis. No studies focusing on metacognition or emotional intelligence were found. Methodological biases, suggestions for future research, and implications for clinical practice were discussed.", "The present study examined everyday attentional disengagements in educational contexts. Undergraduate students completed various cognitive ability measures in the laboratory and recorded everyday mind-wandering and distraction in a diary over the course of a week. Participants reported mind-wandering and being distracted both in class and while studying and there were a number of different subtypes of attentional disengagements. Individual differences in cognitive abilities were related to some, but not all, everyday attentional disengagements and motivation and interest in classes were related to specific subtypes of disengagements. Finally, academic performance was related to fluid intelligence and motivation, but not to everyday disengagements. These results provide importance evidence on the different types of attentional disengagements that are prevalent in undergraduate students and for whom disengagements are most likely.", "Measurement of motivation and cognitive load has potential value in health professions education. Our objective was to evaluate the validity of scores from Dweck's Implicit Theories of Intelligence Scale (ITIS), Elliot's Achievement Goal Questionnaire-Revised (AGQ-R) and Leppink's cognitive load index (CLI).\nThis was a validity study evaluating internal structure using reliability and factor analysis, and relationships with other variables using the multitrait-multimethod matrix. Two hundred and thirty-two secondary school students participated in a medical simulation-based training activity at an academic medical center. Pre-activity ITIS (implicit theory [mindset] domains: incremental, entity) and\u00a0AGQ-R (achievement goal domains: mastery-approach, mastery-avoidance, performance-approach, performance-avoidance), post-activity CLI (cognitive load domains: intrinsic, extrinsic, germane) and task persistence (self-directed repetitions on a laparoscopic surgery task) were measured.\nInternal consistency reliability (Cronbach's alpha) was > 0.70 for all domain scores except AGQ-R performance-avoidance (alpha 0.68) and CLI extrinsic load (alpha 0.64). Confirmatory factor analysis of ITIS and CLI scores demonstrated acceptable model fit. Confirmatory factor analysis of AGQ-R scores demonstrated borderline fit, and exploratory factor analysis suggested a three-domain model for achievement goals (mastery-approach, performance and avoidance). Correlations among scores from conceptually-related domains generally aligned with expectations, as follows: ITIS incremental and entity, r\u00a0=\u00a0-0.52; AGQ-R mastery-avoidance and performance-avoidance, r\u00a0=\u00a00.71; mastery-approach and performance-approach, r\u00a0=\u00a00.55; performance-approach and performance-avoidance, r\u00a0=\u00a00.43; mastery-approach and mastery-avoidance, r\u00a0=\u00a00.36; CLI germane and extrinsic, r\u00a0=\u00a0-0.35; ITIS incremental and AGQ-R mastery-approach, r\u00a0=\u00a00.34; ITIS incremental and CLI germane, r\u00a0=\u00a00.44; AGQ-R mastery-approach and CLI germane, r\u00a0=\u00a00.48 (all p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). We found no correlation between the number of task repetitions (i.e. persistence) and mastery-approach scores, r\u00a0=\u00a0-0.01.\nITIS and CLI scores had appropriate internal structures and relationships with other variables. AGQ-R scores fit a three-factor (not four-factor) model that collapsed avoidance into one domain, although relationships of other variables with the original four domain scores generally aligned with expectations. Mastery goals are positively correlated with germane cognitive load.", "Previous researches have shown that people with higher fluid intelligence are more likely to detect the unexpected stimuli. The current study systematically explored the relationship between fluid intelligence and sustained inattentional blindness in children. In Experiment 1, we measured one hundred and seventy-nine 7-to-14-year-old children's fluid intelligence and sustained inattentional blindness. The results showed that fluid intelligence was negatively related to sustained inattentional blindness only in 7-to-8-year-old children. In Experiment 2, we explored sustained inattentional blindness in sixty children with high Raven's scores. We found that compared with children who have average Raven's scores aged 11-to-12 years old, children with high Raven's scores were unable to better avoid sustained inattentional blindness. In general, this research implies that the relation between fluid intelligence and sustained inattentional blindness is weak. Fluid intelligence could predict sustained inattentional blindness only when children do not have enough perceptual capacities to complete the primary task.", "Heightened sensitivity towards reward and insensitivity towards disadvantageous consequences may constitute a driving factor underlying unrestricted food intake and consequent weight gain in people with overweight and obesity. Therefore, the present study applied a behavioral economics approach to investigate the potential contribution of poor reward-related decision making to unsuccessful long-term weight loss maintenance (i.e. weight cycling). Based on previous research, it was expected that successful long-term weight loss maintainers would show a better performance in a gambling task than their less successful counterparts.\nReward-related decision making was assessed post hoc using the Game of Dice Task in a total of 33 overweight and obese women who had either (a) successfully maintained initial weight loss of at least 10% of their body weight over one year or (b) had regained weight until at least their initial body weight prior to weight reduction (i.e. showed weight cycling).\nThe groups did not differ in terms of age, current body weight, magnitude of initial weight reduction, educational level, and global intelligence level. As hypothesized, however, the group of successful long-term weight loss maintainers performed significantly better (i.e. showed less impulsive, more advantageous choices) in the Game of Dice Task than their less successful counterparts.\nThe findings suggest that poor reward-related decision making is associated with weight cycling which is considered a key concern in weight loss treatments for overweight and obesity. Furthermore, the findings speak in favor of specific psychological interventions that are designed to bolster reward-related decision making.", "Sociodemographic factors are linked to cognitive outcomes in children born very preterm (VPT; \u226430\u00a0weeks gestation). The influence of maternal intellectual ability, a heritable trait, is unknown. Also undetermined is the extent to which associations between maternal and child intellectual ability vary according to parenting behaviors that target cognitive stimulation in the home.\nAt age 5\u00a0years, 84 VPT and 38 demographically matched full-term (FT) children underwent neurodevelopmental assessment. Children's intellectual ability was assessed using The Wechsler Preschool Primary Scale of Intelligence-III, and language was assessed with the Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals Preschool-2. The Wechsler Test of Adult Reading estimated maternal intellectual ability. The StimQ-Preschool questionnaire provided a measure of cognitive stimulation in the home. Linear mixed-effects models examined independent effects and interactions between maternal intellectual ability and cognitive stimulation on children's outcomes.\nAfter covariate adjustment, maternal intellectual ability was associated with child intellectual (p\u00a0<\u00a0.001) and language (p\u00a0=\u00a0.002) abilities. Stronger associations were observed in FT mother-child dyads (B\u00a0=\u00a0.63, p\u00a0=\u00a0.04) than VPT dyads (B\u00a0=\u00a0.42, p\u00a0=\u00a0.01). Mothers of VPT children reported lower levels of Parental Involvement in Developmental Advance (p\u00a0=\u00a0.007) and Parental Verbal Responsiveness (p\u00a0=\u00a0.04). Group differences in Parental Involvement in Developmental Advance, but not Parental Verbal Responsivity, persisted after adjusting for social background (p\u00a0=\u00a0.03). There was no evidence of an interaction between maternal intellectual ability and Parental Involvement in Developmental Advance (p\u00a0=\u00a0.34). Instead, maternal intellectual ability (p\u00a0<\u00a0.001) and Parental Involvement in Developmental Advance (p\u00a0=\u00a0.05) independently predicted VPT children's outcomes.\nMaternal intellectual ability is an important trait linked to VPT and FT children's intellectual and language outcomes. Prematurity increases variation in the heritability of intellectual ability and shifts children from the expected range based on maternal ability. Parental involvement in activities that help children master new skills may promote cognitive development in VPT children born to mothers of lower intellectual ability.", "Invasive coronary angiography (ICA) with measurement of fractional flow reserve (FFR) by means of a pressure wire technique is the established reference standard for the functional assessment of coronary artery disease (CAD) ( 1 , 2 ). Coronary computed tomographic (CT) angiography has emerged as a noninvasive method for direct assessment of CAD and plaque characterization with high diagnostic accuracy compared with ICA ( 3 , 4 ). However, the solely anatomic assessment provided with both coronary CT angiography and ICA has poor discriminatory power for ischemia-inducing lesions. FFR derived from standard coronary CT angiography (FFRCT) data sets by using any of several advanced computational analytic approaches enables combined anatomic and hemodynamic assessment of a coronary lesion by a single noninvasive test. Current technical approaches to the calculation of FFRCT include algorithms based on full- and reduced-order computational fluid dynamic modeling, as well as artificial intelligence deep machine learning ( 5 , 6 ). A growing body of evidence has validated the diagnostic accuracy of FFRCT techniques compared with invasive FFR. Improved therapeutic guidance has been demonstrated, showing the potential of FFRCT to streamline and rationalize the care of patients suspected of having CAD and improve outcomes while reducing overall health care costs ( 7 , 8 ). The purpose of this review is to describe the scientific principles, clinical validation, and implementation of various FFRCT approaches, their precursors, and related imaging tests. \u00a9 RSNA, 2017.", "SCN8A mutations have recently been associated with epilepsy and neurodevelopmental disorders. This study aimed to broaden the phenotypic-spectrum of disease related with SCN8A mutations.\nTo identify the pathogenic gene of a Chinese family, in which six members suffered from epilepsy, whole-exome sequencing was performed. In addition, target next-generation sequencing (NGS) was performed on 178 sporadic patients, who had epilepsy of unknown etiology within 6\u00a0months after birth. A detailed clinical history was obtained.\nA heterozygous missense mutation of SCN8A was identified in the Chinese family. Six de novo mutations of SCN8A were detected in 6 sporadic patients with epilepsy. In the family, six members developed seizures within a few years after birth. Five of them had milder clinical performance, that they had normal cognition and developmental milestones, and seizure-free was achieved by mono-therapy. The other one affected member presented with refractory epilepsy and developmental regression. She died from sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) at 17-year-old. Clinical features of six sporadic patients with SCN8A mutations were diverse, ranging from severe epileptic encephalopathy to benign epilepsy with normal cognition. Seizures started at the mean age of 3.9\u00a0months (from 2\u00a0months to 6\u00a0months). Seizure-free was achieved in four of them by mono- or multi-antiepileptic drugs. Five of them demonstrated mild or severe psychomotor retardation, whereas the other one was normal in development and intelligence.\nOur findings extend the spectrum of SCN8A mutations and the clinical features of patients with SCN8A mutations. The majority of SCN8A mutations were de novo, inherited mutations from the heterozygous parents can also occur. The phenotypic spectrum of SCN8A mutation varied largely. Most affected patients manifested as refractory epilepsy and severe intellectual disability, only a small number of patients presented with milder clinical patterns. Additionally, our study confirmed that the same mutation can lead to different phenotypes.", "Children with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) undergo treatment with central nervous system-directed therapy, the potentially neurotoxic effects of which have not been reported in NHL survivors.\nNHL survivors (n\u2009=\u2009187) participating in the St. Jude Lifetime Cohort who were 10 or more years from their diagnosis and were 18 years old or older underwent neurocognitive, emotional distress (Brief Symptom Inventory 18), and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) assessments (36-Item Short Form Health Survey). Age-adjusted z scores were compared with community controls (n\u2009=\u2009181) and normative data. Treatment exposures were abstracted from medical records. Models adjusted for the age, sex, and time from diagnosis were used to calculate the risk of impairment.\nThe mean ages at evaluation were similar for the survivors and the controls (35.7\u2009\u00b1\u20098.9 vs 35.5\u2009\u00b1\u200911.0 years; P\u2009=\u2009.86). Survivors were 25.2\u2009\u00b1\u20098.8 years from their diagnosis: 43 (23%) received cranial radiation, 70 (37%) received high-dose methotrexate, 40 (21%) received high-dose cytarabine, and 151 (81%) received intrathecal chemotherapy. Survivors' intelligence and attention were within normal limits; however, their memory, executive function, processing speed, and academics were impaired in comparison with both population norms and community controls (P values\u2009<\u2009.05). Treatment-related exposures were not associated with neurocognitive function; however, neurocognitive impairment was associated with lower educational attainment, unemployment, and occupational status (P values\u2009<\u2009.03). Slower processing speed and worse self-reported executive function were associated with symptoms of depression (P values\u2009\u2264\u2009.003) and poorer HRQOL (P values\u2009<\u2009.05).\nAdult survivors of childhood NHL experience impaired neurocognitive function, which is associated with lower social attainment and poor HRQOL. Early-detection and intervention strategies are recommended.

Ninety-nine females aged 12-47, recruited from inpatient and day patient eating disorder services, were assessed with the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule, 2nd edition (ADOS-2), as well as the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence, 2nd edition (WASI-II); Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST); Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Test (ROCFT) and self-report questionnaires assessing eating disorder pathology, depression, cognitive rigidity and attention to detail. Individuals scoring above clinical cut-off on the ADOS-2 (N = 35) reported significantly higher levels of cognitive rigidity than those with lower levels of ASD symptoms but there was no difference between groups on self-reported attention to detail. There group with high levels of ASD symptoms also made significantly more perseverative errors on the WCST but there was no association between ASD symptoms and performance on the ROCFT. The group who scored above cut-off on the ADOS-2 were significantly younger than the sub-clinical groups. The presence of symptoms associated with ASD appears to be related to increased cognitive rigidity in females with AN.", "With a hyperbranched poly(amidoamine) core and many water-soluble poly(ethylene glycol) monomethyl ether arms connected by pH-sensitive acylhydrazone bonds, multiarm hyperbranched polymer was used as nanoreactor and reductant to prepare metal nanoparticles endowed with intelligence and biocompatibility. The multiarm hyperbranched polymer encapsulated nanoparticles (NPs) showed excellent catalytic activity for hydrogenation, thus an excellent catalyst system for hydrogenation was established. The rate constants could reach as high as 3.48 L\u00b7s-1\u00b7m-2, which can be attributed to the lack of surface passivation afforded by the multiarm hyperbranched polymer.", "The aim of the current study is to provide new insights into the relationship between executive functions and intelligence measures in considering the item-position effect observed in intelligence items. Raven's Advanced Progressive Matrices (APM) and Horn's LPS reasoning test were used to assess fluid intelligence which served as criterion in investigating the relationship between intelligence and executive functions. A battery of six experimental tasks measured the updating, shifting, and inhibition processes of executive functions. Data were collected from 205 university students. Fluid intelligence showed substantial correlations with the updating and inhibition processes and no correlation with the shifting process without considering the item-position effect. Next, the fixed-link model was applied to APM and LPS data separately to decompose them into an ability component and an item-position component. The results of relating the components to executive functions showed that the updating and shifting processes mainly contributed to the item-position component whereas the inhibition process was mainly associated with the ability component of each fluid intelligence test. These findings suggest that improvements in the efficiency of updating and shifting processes are likely to occur during the course of completing intelligence measures and inhibition is important for intelligence in general.", "Frozen section is widely used for intraoperative pathological diagnosis (IOPD), which is essential for intraoperative decision making. However, frozen section suffers from some drawbacks, such as time consuming and high misdiagnosis rate. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) with deep learning technology has shown bright future in medicine. We hypothesize that AI with deep learning technology could help IOPD, with a computer trained by a dataset of intraoperative lesion images. Evidences supporting our hypothesis included the successful use of AI with deep learning technology in diagnosing skin cancer, and the developed method of deep-learning algorithm. Large size of the training dataset is critical to increase the diagnostic accuracy. The performance of the trained machine could be tested by new images before clinical use. Real-time diagnosis, easy to use and potential high accuracy were the advantages of AI for IOPD. In sum, AI with deep learning technology is a promising method to help rapid and accurate IOPD.", "Collision avoidance is an important feature in advanced driver-assistance systems, aimed at providing correct, timely and reliable warnings before an imminent collision (with objects, vehicles, pedestrians, etc.). The obstacle recognition library is designed and implemented to address the design and evaluation of obstacle detection in a transportation cyber-physical system. The library is integrated into a co-simulation framework that is supported on the interaction between SCANeR software and Matlab/Simulink. From the best of the authors' knowledge, two main contributions are reported in this paper. Firstly, the modelling and simulation of virtual on-chip light detection and ranging sensors in a cyber-physical system, for traffic scenarios, is presented. The cyber-physical system is designed and implemented in SCANeR. Secondly, three specific artificial intelligence-based methods for obstacle recognition libraries are also designed and applied using a sensory information database provided by SCANeR. The computational library has three methods for obstacle detection: a multi-layer perceptron neural network, a self-organization map and a support vector machine. Finally, a comparison among these methods under different weather conditions is presented, with very promising results in terms of accuracy. The best results are achieved using the multi-layer perceptron in sunny and foggy conditions, the support vector machine in rainy conditions and the self-organized map in snowy conditions.", "The triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) has great potential in the field of self-powered sensor fabrication. Recently, smart electronic devices and movement monitoring sensors have attracted the attention of scientists because of their application in the field of artificial intelligence. In this article, a TENG finger movement monitoring, self-powered sensor has been designed and analysed. Under finger movements, the TENG realizes the contact and separation to convert the mechanical energy into electrical signal. A pulse output current of 7.8\u2009\u03bcA is generated by the bending and straightening motions of the artificial finger. The optimal output power can be realized when the external resistance is approximately 30\u2009M\u03a9. The random motions of the finger are detected by the system with multiple TENG sensors in series. This type of flexible and self-powered sensor has potential applications in artificial intelligence and robot manufacturing.", "Privacy was defined as a fundamental human right in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights at the 1948 United Nations General Assembly. However, there is still no consensus on what constitutes privacy. In this review, we look at the evolution of privacy as a concept from the era of Hippocrates to the era of social media and big data. To appreciate the modern measures of patient privacy protection and correctly interpret the current regulatory framework in the United States, we need to analyze and understand the concepts of individually identifiable information, individually identifiable health information, protected health information, and de-identification. The Privacy Rule of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act defines the regulatory framework and casts a balance between protective measures and access to health information for secondary (scientific) use. The rule defines the conditions when health information is protected by law and how protected health information can be de-identified for secondary use. With the advents of artificial intelligence and computational linguistics, computational text de-identification algorithms produce de-identified results nearly as well as those produced by human experts, but much faster, more consistently and basically for free. Modern clinical text de-identification systems now pave the road to big data and enable scientists to access de-identified clinical information while firmly protecting patient privacy. However, clinical text de-identification is not a perfect process. In order to maximize the protection of patient privacy and to free clinical and scientific information from the confines of electronic healthcare systems, all stakeholders, including patients, health institutions and institutional review boards, scientists and the scientific communities, as well as regulatory and law enforcement agencies must collaborate closely. On the one hand, public health laws and privacy regulations define rules and responsibilities such as requesting and granting only the amount of health information that is necessary for the scientific study. On the other hand, developers of de-identification systems provide guidelines to use different modes of operations to maximize the effectiveness of their tools and the success of de-identification. Institutions with clinical repositories need to follow these rules and guidelines closely to successfully protect patient privacy. To open the gates of big data to scientific communities, healthcare institutions need to be supported in their de-identification and data sharing efforts by the public, scientific communities, and local, state, and federal legislators and government agencies.", "Background: The studies on intelligence in individuals with fetal alcohol exposure are conflicting. Some have found a relevant impairment in this population, while others found results that were consistent with the population at large.\nDescribe the results of studies on intelligence in individuals with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders.\nIndexed articles of the last 10 years were selected for an integrative literature review. After inclusion and exclusion criteria were satisfied 37 articles were selected.\nGeneral intelligence, both verbal and non-verbal, is impaired in people who are prenatally exposed to alcohol. There is a tendency to a greater reduction in the Freedom from Distractibility/Working Memory Index of Wechsler Scales.\nReduction in intelligence seems to occur on a continuum similar to the fetal alcohol spectrum. The reduction of the Freedom from Distractibility/Working Memory Index appears to be a reflection of a greater impairment of mathematical ability.", "The importance of emotional intelligence (EI) in physicians has attracted attention as researchers begin to focus on the relationship of EI to retention, promotion, and productivity among academic physicians. However, to date, no formal evaluation of EI has been conducted among current department chairs. The objectives of this study were to assess the EI of current chairs of academic radiation oncology departments and to correlate EI with a self-reported assessment of burnout.The authors invited 95 chairs of academic radiation oncology departments to participate in a survey, approved by an institutional review board, consisting of the Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire Short Form (TEIQue-SF) and the abbreviated Maslach Burnout Inventory (a-MBI). TEIQue-SF scores were evaluated for correlation with respondents' demographics and self-reported burnout scores on the a-MBI. Sixty chairs responded to the survey, for a response rate of 63.2%. The median (interquartile range) TEIQue-SF for the responding cohort was 172 (155-182) out of a maximum possible score of 210. The a-MBI emotional exhaustion and depersonalization subscores were low, with median (interquartile range) scores of 4 (2.25-6.75) and 1 (0-2.75) out of maximum possible scores of 18 and 30, respectively. Higher TEIQue-SF global scores were weakly correlated with decreased burnout. The study results show that academic radiation oncology chairs had a high EI and low rates of self-reported burnout. EI may be of increasing importance with respect to recruitment and retention of academic medical leaders.", "Professionals examine various aspects of girls' and boys' drawings as a way of understanding their intelligence, personality and emotional state. However, the extent to which such measures could be universally generalised or attributed to a specific cultural norm is still a debatable issue. In the present study five key features of children's drawings namely: the size (height) of the drawings, profile or full face, figure in action or static, shaded or non-shaded and the nature of additional details were examined from a cross-cultural perspective, and by providing a topic (football) for which children's drawing of a human figure could provide opportunities for the latter indices to manifest and flourish. Children from three countries; England, Iran and Brazil, representing three continents took part in this study. The participants were asked to draw a football player from their own country and from the other participating countries. The results showed that Brazilian children differ from Iranian and English children by drawing significantly smaller figures and putting more football action in the drawings. Shading of the figure drawn was more prevalent amongst English children. Such findings have implications for the interpretation of key aspects of children's drawings in educational, clinical and therapeutic settings and from a universal vs. culturally-specific viewpoint.", "This study analyzes the relationship between emotion understanding and school achievement in children of primary school, considering age, gender, fluid intelligence, mother's educational level and social competence. In this study participated 406 children of primary school. The instruments used were the Test of Emotion Comprehension, Colored Progressive Matrices of Raven, Socially Action and Interpersonal Problem Solving Scale. The structural equation model showed the relationship between the emotion understanding and school performance depends on a mediator variable that in the context of the study was designated social competence. Age appear as an explanatory factor of the differences found, the mother's educational level only predicts significantly social emotional competence, fluid intelligence is a predictor of emotion understanding, school achievement and social emotional competence. Regarding the influence of sex, emotional understanding does not emerge as a significant predictor of social emotional competence in girls or boys. Multiple relationships between the various factors associated with school achievement and social emotional competence are discussed as well as their implications in promoting child development and school success.", "Schizophrenia is a complex disorder that may be the result of aberrant connections between specific brain regions rather than focal brain abnormalities. Here, we investigate the relationships between brain structural connectivity as described by network analysis, intelligence, symptoms, and polygenic risk scores (PGRS) for schizophrenia in a group of patients with schizophrenia and a group of healthy controls. Recently, researchers have shown an interest in the role of high centrality networks in the disorder. However, the importance of non-central networks still remains unclear. Thus, we specifically examined network-averaged fractional anisotropy (mean edge weight) in central and non-central subnetworks. Connections with the highest betweenness centrality within the average network (>75% of centrality values) were selected to represent the central subnetwork. The remaining connections were assigned to the non-central subnetwork. Additionally, we calculated graph theory measures from the average network (connections that occur in at least 2/3 of participants). Density, strength, global efficiency, and clustering coefficient were significantly lower in patients compared with healthy controls for the average network (pFDR \u2009<\u20090.05). All metrics across networks were significantly associated with intelligence (pFDR \u2009<\u20090.05). There was a tendency towards significance for a correlation between intelligence and PGRS for schizophrenia (r\u2009=\u2009-0.508, p\u2009=\u20090.052) that was significantly mediated by central and non-central mean edge weight and every graph metric from the average network. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that intelligence deficits are associated with a genetic risk for schizophrenia, which is mediated via the disruption of distributed brain networks.

The gold standard i.e. indirect calorimetry is not available in clinical settings. Thus, several predictive equations have been developed, but they lack of accuracy in subjects with extreme weight including obese populations. Artificial neural networks (ANN) are useful predictive tools in the area of artificial intelligence, used in numerous clinical fields. The aim of this study was to determine the relevance of ANN in predicting REE in obesity.\nA Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) feed-forward neural network with a back propagation algorithm was created and cross-validated in a cohort of 565 obese subjects (BMI within 30-50\u00a0kg\u00a0m-2) with weight, height, sex and age as clinical inputs and REE measured by indirect calorimetry as output. The predictive performances of ANN were compared to those of 23 predictive REE equations in the training set and in two independent sets of 100 and 237 obese subjects for external validation.\nAmong the 23 established prediction equations for REE evaluated, the Harris & Benedict equations recalculated by Roza were the most accurate for the obese population, followed by the USA DRI, M\u00fcller and the original Harris & Benedict equations. The final 5-fold cross-validated three-layer 4-3-1 feed-forward back propagation ANN model developed in that study improved precision and accuracy of REE prediction over linear equations (precision\u00a0=\u00a068.1%, MAPE\u00a0=\u00a08.6% and RMSPE\u00a0=\u00a0210\u00a0kcal/d), independently from BMI subgroups within 30-50\u00a0kg\u00a0m-2. External validation confirmed the better predictive performances of ANN model (precision\u00a0=\u00a073% and 65%, MAPE\u00a0=\u00a07.7% and 8.6%, RMSPE\u00a0=\u00a0187\u00a0kcal/d and 200\u00a0kcal/d in the 2 independent datasets) for the prediction of REE in obese subjects.\nWe developed and validated an ANN model for the prediction of REE in obese subjects that is more precise and accurate than established REE predictive equations independent from BMI subgroups. For convenient use in clinical settings, we provide a simple ANN-REE calculator available at: https://www.crnh-rhone-alpes.fr/fr/ANN-REE-Calculator.", "Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a leading cause of suffering for both patients and their natural caregivers. A preliminary study highlights the association of emotional intelligence (EI) and coping strategies with quality of life. However, there is a lack of studies concerning dyadic (i.e., patient and natural caregiver) characteristics' impact on anxious and depressive symptoms. In a sample of MDD patients-caregivers dyads, we explored the influence of EI and coping strategies on anxious and depressive symptoms using the actor-partner interdependence model (APIM).\nThe cross-sectional study included 79 MDD patient-caregiver dyads. Self-reported data, completed by patients and their primary caregivers, were collected including socio-demographic, EI using TEIQue-SF, coping strategies using BriefCope, depressive symptoms using Beck Depression Inventory, anxious symptoms using STAI. The APIM was used to test the dyadic effects of EI and coping strategies on anxious and depressive symptoms, using structural equation modelling.\nPatients and caregivers reported both anxious and depressive symptoms. Coping strategies, such as problem solving, positive thinking and avoidance, exhibited evidence of actor (degree to which the individual's coping strategies are associated with their own anxiety or depression level) and partner effect (degree to which the individual's coping strategies are associated with the anxiety or depression level of the other member of the dyad). The caregivers' EI was associated with a decrease of their own depression level contrary to patients for which the results were not significant. The patients' and caregivers' EI was associated with a decrease of their own level of anxiety.\nEI and coping strategies were moderately associated with anxious and depressive symptomatology among MDD patient-caregiver dyads. These results suggest that targeted interventions could be proposed to both patients and caregivers.", "Research in younger adults dissociates cognitive from affective facets of social information processing, rather than promoting a monolithic view of social intelligence. An influential theory on adult development suggests differential effects of aging on cognitive and affective functions. However, this dissociation has not been directly tested in the social domain. Employing a newly developed naturalistic paradigm that disentangles facets of the social mind within an individual, we show multi-directionality of age-related differences. Specifically, components of the socio-cognitive route - Theory of Mind and metacognition - are impaired in older relative to younger adults. Nevertheless, these social capacities are still less affected by aging than factual reasoning and metacognition regarding non-social content. Importantly, the socio-affective route is well-functioning, with no decline in empathy and elevated compassion in the elderly. These findings contribute to an integrated theory of age-related change in social functioning and inform interventions tailored to specifically reinstate socio-cognitive skills in old age.", "We are living in an age where artificial intelligence and astounding technological advances are bringing truly remarkable change to healthcare. Medical knowledge and skills which form the core responsibility of doctors such as making diagnoses may increasingly be delivered by robots. Machines are gradually acquiring human abilities such as deep learning and empathy. What, then is the role of doctors in future healthcare? And what direction should medical schools be taking to prepare their graduates? This article will give an overview of the evolving technological landscape of healthcare and examine the issues undergraduate medical education may have to address. The experience at The University of Hong Kong will serve as a case study featuring several curricular innovations that aim to empower medical graduates with the capabilities to thrive in the future.", "The role of repeated episodes of malaria on the cognitive development of children is a relevant issue in endemic areas since it can have a long-lasting impact on individual lifespan. The aim of the current paper was to investigate whether the history of malaria can impair the verbal and performance skills of children living in an endemic area with low transmission of Plasmodium vivax malaria.\nA cross-sectional study was conducted with children living in an endemic area of P. vivax malaria in Brazilian Amazon basin. The history of episodes of malaria was used as criteria for inclusion of children in the groups. The cognitive performance was assessed by the Wechsler intelligence scale for children-III edition (WISC-III), which was applied to the participants of study by two trained psychologists.\nA total of 17 cases and 26 controls was included in the study. A significant low score of verbal quotient was found in the cases (p\u00a0=\u00a00.005), however, the performance IQ was similar in both groups (p\u00a0=\u00a00.304). The full-scale IQ was significantly lower in the cases when compared to the controls (p\u00a0=\u00a00.042). The factorials index showed significant difference only in the subtest of verbal comprehension with the lower values in the cases (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0382), compared to the controls. The perceptual organization (p\u00a0=\u00a00.363), freedom from distractability (p\u00a0=\u00a00.180) and processing speed (p\u00a0=\u00a00.132) were similar in both groups.\nChildren with a history of vivax malaria has a significant impairment of verbal and full-scale quotients as well as a significant low index of verbal comprehension. These findings are likely due to the absenteeism caused by malaria and by the low parental education, which impairs an adequate response to the environmental stimulus.", "This study investigated the relationship of bullying victimization and perpetration with the levels of intelligence, attention, and executive function in children who had received a diagnosis of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The experiences of bullying involvement in 105 children with ADHD were assessed using the Chinese version of the School Bullying Experience Questionnaire. Their scores for four intelligence indexes on the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children 4th Edition-Chinese version were determined. Their levels of attention and executive function were assessed using the Comprehensive Nonverbal Attention Test Battery. The results of logistic regression analyses indicated that a high Perceptual Reasoning Index was significantly associated with a decreased risk of being victims of bullying. A high level of executive function was significantly associated with a decreased risk of being victims and perpetrators of bullying. Bullying victimization and perpetration in children with ADHD having a low PRI and low executive function should be routinely surveyed.", "The recent booming development of wearable electronics urgently calls for high-performance flexible strain sensors. To date, it is still a challenge to manufacture flexible strain sensors with superb sensitivity and a large workable strain range simultaneously. Herein, a facile, quick, cost-effective, and scalable strategy is adopted to fabricate novel strain sensors based on reduced graphene oxide woven fabrics (GWF). By pyrolyzing commercial cotton bandages coated with graphene oxide (GO) sheets in an ethanol flame, the reduction of GO and the pyrolysis of the cotton bandage template can be synchronously completed in tens of seconds. Due to the unique hierarchical structure of the GWF, the strain sensor based on GWF exhibits large stretchability (57% strain) with high sensitivity, inconspicuous drift, and durability. The GWF strain sensor is successfully used to monitor full-range (both subtle and vigorous) human activities or physical vibrational signals of the local environment. The present work offers an effective strategy to rapidly prepare low-cost flexible strain sensors with potential applications in the fields of wearable electronics, artificial intelligence devices, and so forth.", "Cancer is the second important morbidity and mortality factor among women and the most incident type is breast cancer. This paper suggests a hybrid computational intelligence model based on unsupervised and supervised learning techniques, i.e., self-organizing map (SOM) and complex-valued neural network (CVNN), for reliable detection of breast cancer. The dataset used in this paper consists of 822 patients with five features (patient's breast mass shape, margin, density, patient's age, and Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System assessment). The proposed model was used for the first time and can be categorized in two stages. In the first stage, considering the input features, SOM technique was used to cluster the patients with the most similarity. Then, in the second stage, for each cluster, the patient's features were applied to complex-valued neural network and dealt with to classify breast cancer severity (benign or malign). The obtained results corresponding to each patient were compared to the medical diagnosis results using receiver operating characteristic analyses and confusion matrix. In the testing phase, health and disease detection ratios were 94 and 95%, respectively. Accordingly, the superiority of the proposed model was proved and can be used for reliable and robust detection of breast cancer.", "Objective: To discuss the relationship between breastfeeding and the behavioral development of infants and children. Methods: Based on the Ma'anshan Birth Cohort Study, there were 3 474 pregnant women recruited from Ma'anshan Maternal and Child Care Center between May 2013 and September 2014, including 3 273 singleton live births. Follow up the infants to the age of 18 months old. Excluded the infants with incomplete information of breastfeeding and who did not finish the ASQ-3 evaluation in 6 months old and 18 months old, 2 404 valid subjects were included in the study. The information of demographic characteristics, deliver, infants and breastfeeding was collected. The behavioral development were evaluated by the third edition of Ages and Stages Questionnaire (ASQ-3) at 6 months old and 18 months old, and the effect of breastfeeding on behavioral development among infants and children were analyzed by multivariable logistic regression model. Results: The intensity of breastfeeding of infants within 6 months old was (26.56\u00b110.56). The rate of breastfeeding as pure or major intake for infants between 0-5 months old were separately 54.2% (1 303), 54.0% (1 298). 54.0% (1 297), 50.5% (1 213), 34.4% (827) and 9.9% (237). After age, pre-pregnant BMI, intelligence, delivery mode, gender, gestational age, birth weight and family economic status adjusted, compared to never-breastfeeding, continuous breastfeeding for 1-3 months could protect children from severe developmental delay in fine motor domain aged 6 months old (RR=0.36, 95%CI: 0.17-0.79), communication domain aged 18 months old (RR=0.27, 95%CI: 0.08-0.88), and social domain aged 18 months old (RR=0.36, 95%CI: 0.21-0.63). Compared to never-breastfeeding, continuous breastfeeding for more than 4 months could protect children from severe developmental delay in fine motor domain aged 6 months old (RR=0.58, 95%CI: 0.34-0.97), communication domain (RR=0.57, 95%CI: 0.39-0.83) and mild developmental delay (RR=0.65, 95%CI: 0.48-0.87) aged 18 months old and fine motor domain (RR=0.57, 95%CI: 0.39-0.83) aged 18 months old and social domain aged 18 months old (RR=0.57, 95%CI: 0.39-0.83). With the breastfeeding intensity rising, there were less children evaluated as severe development delay in communication domain aged 6 months old, communication, fine motor and problem-solving domains aged 18 months old, with RR (95%CI) at 0.98 (0.96-1.00), 0.96 (0.93-0.99), 0.98 (0.97-1.00) and 0.98 (0.96-1.00); and less children evaluated as mild development delay in communication domain aged 18 months old with RR (95%CI) at 0.99 (0.98-1.00). Conclusion: Breastfeeding with longer duration and increased intensity could promote better development in children.\n\u76ee\u7684\uff1a

"This article describes the context in which 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA), 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) and other mescaline-like compounds were explored as hallucinogens for military and intelligence purposes from the 1940s to the 1960s. Germans first tested mescaline as a \"truth drug\" in a military context. In the 1940s, the United States military started testing hallucinogenic substances as truth drugs for interrogation and behavior manipulation. After tests carried out using mescaline and other drugs in 1950, some derivatives of mescaline were synthesized by the Army for the exploration of possible \"speech-inducing\" effects. After insufficient animal testing, the substances were given to patients at the New York State Psychiatric Institute (NYSPI). 3,4-Methylenedioxy-N-ethylamphetamine (MDE), a compound almost identical to MDMA, was among the compounds delivered for testing at the NYSPI. During tests with other derivatives (3,4-dimethoxyphenethylamine (DMA), 3,4-methylenedioxyphenethylamine (MDPEA), MDA) in 1952-53, an unwitting patient died in these tests, which was kept secret from the public. Research was interrupted and toxicological animal testing procedures were initiated. The secret animal studies run in 1953/1954 revealed that some of the \"mescaline derivatives\" tested (e.g. MDA, MDE, DMA, 3,4,5-trimethoxyamphetamine (TMA), MDMA) were considered for further testing in humans. In 1955, the military changed focus to lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), but some interest in mescaline-like compounds remained for their ability to change mood and habit without interfering with cognition and sensory perception. Based on the known documents, it remains unclear (but probable) whether any of the mescaline derivatives tested were being used operationally.", "Traditionally, forensic science has predominantly focused its resources and objectives on addressing court related questions. However, this view restricts the contribution of forensic science to one function and results in lost opportunities as investigative and intelligence roles are often overlooked. A change of perspective and expansion of the contributions of forensic science is required to take advantage of the benefits of abductive and inductive thought processes throughout the investigative and intelligence functions. One forensic discipline that has the potential to broaden its traditional focus is handwriting examination. Typically used in investigations that are focused on both criminal and civil cases, the examination procedure and outcome are time consuming and subjective, requiring a detailed study of the features of the handwriting in question. Traditionally, the major handwriting features exploited are characteristics that are often considered individual (or at least highly polymorphic) and habitual. However, handwriting can be considered as an information vector in an intelligence framework. One such example is the recognition of key elements related to the author's native language. This paper discusses the traditional method generally used around the world and proposes a theoretical approach to expand the application of handwriting examination towards gaining additional information for intelligence purposes. This concept will be designed and tested in a future research project.", "Regional cortical brain volume is the product of surface area and thickness. These measures exhibit partially distinct trajectories of change across the brain's cortex in older age, but it is unclear which cortical characteristics at which loci are sensitive to cognitive ageing differences. We examine associations between change in intelligence from age 11 to 73\u00a0years and regional cortical volume, surface area, and thickness measured at age 73\u00a0years in 568 community-dwelling older adults, all born in 1936. A relative positive change in intelligence from 11 to 73 was associated with larger volume and surface area in selective frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital regions (r\u00a0<\u00a00.180, FDR-corrected q\u00a0<\u00a00.05). There were no significant associations between cognitive ageing and a thinner cortex for any region. Interestingly, thickness and surface area were phenotypically independent across bilateral lateral temporal loci, whose surface area was significantly related to change in intelligence. These findings suggest that associations between regional cortical volume and cognitive ageing differences are predominantly driven by surface area rather than thickness among healthy older adults. Regional brain surface area has been relatively underexplored, and is a potentially informative biomarker for identifying determinants of cognitive ageing differences.", "The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between alterations of functional brain network and cognition in patients with benign epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (BECTS) as a function of spike-wave index (SWI) during slow wave sleep.\nResting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-fMRI) data and Intelligence Quotient (IQ) were collected from two groups of patients with BECTS, including a SWI<50% group (5 cases) and a SWI\u226550% group (7 cases). The SWI was calculated from the long-term video-electroencephalogram monitoring (one sleep cycle was included at least). The RS-fMRI data were analyzed by regional homogeneity (ReHo) method.\nThere were three main findings. Firstly, Full Intelligence Quotient (FIQ), Verbal Intelligence Quotient (VIQ), and Performance Intelligence Quotient (PIQ) of the SWI\u226550% group were significantly lower than SWI<50% group (p<0.05). Secondly, there was a negative correlation between the FIQ, VIQ, PIQ, and SWI (p<0.05), and the FIQ, VIQ, and PIQ were not dependent on age, age of onset, disease course, years of education, and total number of seizures (p>0.05). Finally, compared with the SWI<50% group, the SWI\u226550% group showed increased ReHo in the bilateral precentral gyrus, bilateral premotor area, bilateral subcortical structure, right temporal lobe, and bilateral insular lobe, while they showed decreased ReHo in the posterior cingulate cortex and posterior of right inferior temporal lobe.\nThe alterations of functional brain network caused by the frequent discharges during slow wave sleep could affect cognition in patients with BECTS.", "The foundation for a new era of data-driven medicine has been set by recent technological advances that enable the assessment and management of human health at an unprecedented level of resolution-what we refer to as high-definition medicine. Our ability to assess human health in high definition is enabled, in part, by advances in DNA sequencing, physiological and environmental monitoring, advanced imaging, and behavioral tracking. Our ability to understand and act upon these observations at equally high precision is driven by advances in genome editing, cellular reprogramming, tissue engineering, and information technologies, especially artificial intelligence. In this review, we will examine the core disciplines that enable high-definition medicine and project how these technologies will alter the future of medicine.", "Deep neural networks (DNNs) are complex computational models that have found great success in many artificial intelligence applications, such as computer vision1,2 and natural language processing.3,4 In the past four years, DNNs have also generated promising results for quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) tasks.5,6 Previous work showed that DNNs can routinely make better predictions than traditional methods, such as random forests, on a diverse collection of QSAR data sets. It was also found that multitask DNN models-those trained on and predicting multiple QSAR properties simultaneously-outperform DNNs trained separately on the individual data sets in many, but not all, tasks. To date there has been no satisfactory explanation of why the QSAR of one task embedded in a multitask DNN can borrow information from other unrelated QSAR tasks. Thus, using multitask DNNs in a way that consistently provides a predictive advantage becomes a challenge. In this work, we explored why multitask DNNs make a difference in predictive performance. Our results show that during prediction a multitask DNN does borrow \"signal\" from molecules with similar structures in the training sets of the other tasks. However, whether this borrowing leads to better or worse predictive performance depends on whether the activities are correlated. On the basis of this, we have developed a strategy to use multitask DNNs that incorporate prior domain knowledge to select training sets with correlated activities, and we demonstrate its effectiveness on several examples.", "At the time of school-age, the most frequent stress stimuli are related to school environment and educational process. Anxiety may play a big role in coping with stressful situations associated with school load. To approach this issue, we performed a real-life study at school during the classwork. The sample consisted of 36 healthy children aged 10\u00a0years, which were divided to low and high trait anxiety group based on the median value of the anxiety score. The investigations were carried out in the classroom during a stress condition (final exams) and non-stress condition (without any exam). In the whole sample, the condition with exam was associated with higher cortisol and lower testosterone concentrations in saliva compared to the condition without exam. The activity of salivary alpha-amylase increased at the end of the exam. Anxious children showed higher concentrations of aldosterone and lower activity of alpha-amylase compared to children with low trait anxiety. Cortisol levels were higher in anxious children in the first morning samples before starting the lessons. Children with high and low trait anxiety did not differ in extraversion, neuroticism, as well as non-verbal intelligence and school success. Thus, the anxious children at school showed a more rapid decrease of anticipatory stress-induced cortisol concentrations, higher aldosterone levels, and lower alpha-amylase activities compared to non-anxious children. These changes, particularly high concentrations of aldosterone in children with high trait anxiety, may have an impact on their psychophysiological development.", "Identification and complete resection of colorectal polyps provide a significant mortality benefit from colorectal cancer. With improvements in colonoscopic techniques and advanced endoscopic imaging techniques, polyp detection has taken on greater complexity since the establishment of bowel cancer screening programmes internationally. All endoscopists operating within symptomatic and screening populations should be aware of endoscopic features associated with advanced neoplasia. Chromoendoscopy and advanced imaging techniques, such as narrow spectrum technologies (narrow band imaging, flexible spectral imaging colour enhancement (FICE) and i-Scan digital contrast (iSCAN)), have specific classification systems to support accurate lesion characterisation. This review summarises the evidence in relation to polyp detection, recognition and characterisation as well as the identification of features of invasion. Future areas of interest include optimal management of large polyps, incorporation of a 'detect, resect and discard' strategy for small and diminutive polyps, expected wider use of computer decision support tools (artificial intelligence and deep learning) and the use of fluorescently labelled molecular probes to improve detection and assessment of neoplasia.", "We report the findings from and comment on the surveys of the oral health of 5-year-old children undertaken in Scotland (2013-14), Wales (2014-15) and England (2014-15). This was the fourteenth survey in Scotland since 1988. In England and Wales it is the third survey since 2007 when changes were required in consent arrangements.\nRepresentative samples were drawn within Health Boards across Scotland and local authorities across England and Wales. Consent was sought via opt-out parental consent in Scotland and opt-in parental consent in England and Wales. Children examined were those aged five in England and those in Primary 1 (school year aged 5 to 6) in Scotland and Wales. Examinations were conducted in schools by trained and calibrated examiners. Caries was visually diagnosed at the dentinal threshold.\nThere is a continuing decline in d\u2083mft in all three countries. d\u2083mft was 1.27 (opt-out consent) for Scotland, 0.84 for England (opt-in consent) and 1.29 for Wales (opt-in consent). Tooth decay levels remain higher in more deprived areas across Great Britain, with clear inequalities gradients demonstrated across all geographies. Attempts to measure changes in dental health inequalities across the three countries show no conclusive trends.\nInter-country comparisons provide further oral health intelligence despite differences in approach and timing. The third surveys in England and Wales using the new consent arrangements have enabled trend analysis. Dental health inequalities gradients were shown across all geographies and all of the indicators of inequality.", "The management of births at borderline viability continues to present dilemmas for health professionals and parents. The aim of the study was to review local outcomes of infants born between 22 and 24 weeks of gestation between 2004 and 2010 in Western Australia (WA) to aid perinatal counselling.\nSurvival data for the study were sourced retrospectively from the Neonatal Clinical Care Unit and Department of Health records of births in WA. Neurodevelopmental follow-up outcomes were assessed using the most recent standardised assessment (Griffiths, Bayley-III and Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence, 3rd Ed) and medical examination of infants/children 12 months to 8 years from follow-up clinic appointments.\nAt these gestations, 159 survivors represented 72% of neonatal intensive care unit admissions, 53% of WA live births and 26% of WA live and still births; 5% of live births survived at 22 weeks, 46% at 23 weeks and 77% at 24 weeks. Of the 14 outborn/retrieved infants, 4 survived (29%). At a median age of 59 months, disabilities were severe in 13% of children (22-23w = 19%; 24w = 11%). The median test quotient was 90. Moderate and severe cognitive disability was found in 16%, cerebral palsy was found in 7% (n = 11), and 55% of children were free from impairment as defined in this study.\nAt these gestations, survival figures varied markedly with the chosen population denominator. Regional data are essential for valid population comparison. While many developmental difficulties occurred in these children, 78% were free from moderate or severe impairment at ages 3-5 years.", "In the assessment of older adults with very low formal education, typical tests of selective attention and inhibitory control are biased by reading abilities. In this sense, we aim to assess the psychometric characteristics of the Five Digits Test (FDT), a numerical Stroop paradigm, in older adults without cognitive disorders, with mild cognitive impairment, and with dementia.\nWe assessed 211 Brazilian older adults with low formal education using the FDT and other cognitive measures. Construct validity and reliability were assessed by correlations and internal consistency.\nThe FDT test had weak correlations with crystalized intelligence tests and moderate-high correlations with fluid intelligence measures and tests of global cognitive status and executive functions. The split-half coefficient of reliability showed high internal consistency (>0.900).\nTogether, the results suggest that the FDT is a valid and reliable measure for the assessment of processing speed and executive functions in older adults with low formal education.", "Diagnostic exome sequencing (DES) has aided delineation of the phenotypic spectrum of rare genetic etiologies of intellectual disability (ID). A SET domain containing 5 gene (SETD5) phenotype of ID and dysmorphic features has been previously described in relation to patients with 3p25.3 deletions and in a few individuals with de novo sequence alterations. Herein, we present additional patients with pathogenic SETD5 sequence alterations. The majority of patients in this cohort and previously reported have developmental delay, behavioral/psychiatric issues, and variable hand and skeletal abnormalities. We also present an apparently unaffected carrier mother of an affected individual and a carrier mother with normal intelligence and affected twin sons. We suggest that the phenotype of SETD5 is more complex and variable than previously presented. Therefore, many features and presentations need to be considered when evaluating a patient for SETD5 alterations through DES.", "Manganese is commonly found in water but potential neurotoxic effects from exposure through drinking water are poorly understood. We previously reported a cross-sectional study showing that drinking water Mn concentration was associated with lower IQ in children aged 6 to 13 years.\nFor this follow-up study, we aimed to re-assess the relation between exposure to Mn from drinking water and IQ at adolescence. In addition, we aimed to examine whether changes in drinking water Mn concentration was associated with changes in IQ scores.\nFrom the 380 children enrolled in the baseline study, 287 participated to this follow-up study conducted in average 4.4 years after. Mn concentration was measured in home tap water and children's hair. The relationships between these Mn exposure indicators and IQ scores (Weschsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence) at follow-up were assessed with linear regression analysis, adjusting for potential confounders. Intra-individual differences in IQ scores between the two examinations were compared for children whose Mn concentration in water remained stable between examinations, increased or decreased.\nThe mean age at follow-up was 13.7 years (range, 10.5 to 18.0 years). Geometric mean of Mn concentration in water at follow-up was 14.5\u03bcg/L. Higher Mn concentration in water measured at follow-up was associated with lower Performance IQ in girls (\u03b2 for a 10-fold increase=-2.8, 95% confidence intervals [CI] -4.8 to -0.8) and higher Performance IQ in boys (\u03b2=3.9, 95% CI 1.4 to 6.4). IQ scores were not significantly associated with Mn concentration in hair, although similar trends as for concentration in water were observed. For children whose Mn concentration in water increased between baseline and follow-up, Performance IQ scores decreased significantly (intra-individual difference, -2.4 points).\nHigher levels of Mn in drinking water were associated with lower Performance IQ in girls, whereas the opposite was observed in boys. These findings suggest long-term exposure to Mn through drinking water is associated differently with cognition in boys and girls.", "Previous research investigating outcomes after pediatric intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) has generally been limited to global and sensorimotor outcomes. This study examined cognitive outcomes after spontaneous ICH in school-aged children with serial assessments over 2 years after stroke.\nSeven children (age range 6-16y, median 13; six males, one female; 57% white, 43% black) presenting with spontaneous ICH (six arteriovenous malformations) were assessed at 3 months, 12 months, and 24 months after stroke. The Pediatric Stroke Outcome Measure (PSOM) quantified neurological outcome and Wechsler Intelligence Scales measured cognitive outcomes: verbal comprehension, perceptual reasoning, working memory, and processing speed.\nPSOM scales showed improved neurological function over the first 12 months, with mild to no sensorimotor deficits and moderate overall deficits at 1- and 2-year follow-ups (median 2-year sensorimotor PSOM=0.5, total PSOM=1.5). Changes in cognitive function indicated a different trajectory; verbal comprehension and perceptual reasoning improved over 24 months; low performance was sustained in processing speed and working memory. Age-normed centile scores decreased between 1- and 2-year follow-ups for working memory, suggesting emerging deficits compared with peers.\nEarly and serial cognitive testing in children with ICH is needed to assess cognitive functioning and support children in school as they age and cognitive deficits become more apparent and important for function.\nIn children with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), motor function improved between 3 months and 24 months. Improvements in cognitive function were variable between 3 months and 24 months. Working memory centiles declined, suggesting emerging deficits compared with peers. Processing speed improved but remained significantly below the 50th centile. Cognitive impact of ICH may increase with age in children.", "Research shows that adolescents with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) experience difficulties developing friendships, and that loneliness is a significant factor contributing to higher incidence of anxiety and depression within this population.\nThis study aimed to provide an in-depth analysis of relationships as described by adolescents with ASD, and, from these descriptions, to explore what can be inferred about the development of successful interpersonal relationships for these individuals.\nEight adolescents with ASD participated in semi-structured interviews using established personal construct theory (PCT) techniques.\nPCT was found to be a helpful approach to elicit rich, qualitative data. A thematic analysis identified four themes: relationships as a source of support, perceptions of similarity and difference, valued qualities in self and others, and the development and maintenance of relationships.\nWhilst this exploratory study highlighted some commonality in terms of perceptions of family support and friendships as protective and desirable, participants differed in their ability to establish and maintain peer relationships. Participants valued personal qualities such as intelligence, humour and trust within relationships, and recognised the important role of peers and siblings in the development of social skills, a finding which has implications for the delivery of social skills training and other interventions. The study provides empirical support for the application of personal construct methodologies in ASD research and offers a potentially useful approach to therapeutic intervention.", "Prematurity and its consequences are serious problems that can result in numerous neurosensory disabilities and cerebral cognitive dysfunctions. The Perinatal Risk Index (PERI) might provide a predictive measure of these problems.\nThis study compared the cognitive development of prematurely born children at 4 and 5 years of age with age-matched peers born at term. The secondary objective was to determine whether a correlation exists between perinatal risk and performance on neuropsychological tests among premature children.\nA total of 54 children between four and five years of age were evaluated; 27 were born very premature (premature group; PG), and 27 were born at term (term group; TG). Executive function, attention, memory, language, visual perception, and spatial structuring were evaluated. Subtests from the Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children, the Rey Complex Figure Test, the McCarthy Scales of Children's Abilities, the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test, Test A, Trails A and B, the spatial structuring questionnaire from the Child Neuropsychological Maturity Questionnaire, and the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children were used. A PERI score was also obtained for the PG.\nThe PG showed significantly lower scores than the TG in all the studied cognitive domains. Visual-perceptive scores were significantly and negatively correlated with the PERI scores of the PG.\nThe PG showed neurocognitive deficits compared with the TG. The PERI can be used to predict the development of visual-perceptive abilities in children between four and five years of age.", "Disparity of verbal and performance intelligence (VIQ, PIQ) on the Wechsler scales of intelligence is a conceptually cluttered and empirically weak measure of hemispheric specialization (HS). However, in the context of life span research, it is the only measure that can be exploited meta-analytically with the lesion method from prenatal life to late senescence. We assembled 1917 cases with a unilateral cortical focal brain lesion occurring at all ages and a post-lesion VIQ and PIQ. Lesion locus, volume and side were documented for each case, as well as age at lesion onset, age at first symptoms and age at the IQ test, presence/absence of epilepsy, lesion aetiology, gender, date of publication or of transfer of medical file. With and without covariate adjustment, HS was significant across the life span though its pattern changed. HS increased linearly and highly significantly until late senescence. Only in early adulthood did VIQ appear to vacate the right temporal lobe and occupy the left and PIQ vacate the left parietal lobe and occupy the right until late senescence. Biomaturational factors are more important in the ontogeny of material-specific HS over the whole life span than previously established.", "This paper presents an artificial intelligence-based approach to identifying environmental indicators of oyster norovirus outbreaks in coastal waters. It was found that oyster norovirus outbreaks are generally linked to the extreme combination of antecedent environmental conditions characterized by low water temperature, low solar radiation, low gage height, low salinity, strong wind, and heavy precipitation. Among the six environmental indicators, the most important three indicators, including water temperature, solar radiation and gage height, are capable of explaining 77.7% of model-predicted oyster norovirus outbreaks while the extremely low temperature alone may explain 37.2% of oyster norovirus outbreaks. It is, therefore, recommended that water temperature in oyster harvesting areas be monitored in the cold season and particularly the extremely low temperature during a low gage height be used as the primary indicator of oyster norovirus outbreaks. The findings are of profound significance to reducing the public health risk of norovirus outbreaks associated with consumption of oysters.", "As a component of self-regulation, delay discounting (DD) refers to an individual's tendency to prefer smaller-but-sooner rewards over larger-but-later rewards and plays an essential role in many aspects of human behavior. Although numerous studies have examined the neural underpinnings of DD in adults, there are far fewer studies focusing on the neurobiological correlates underlying DD in adolescents. Here, we investigated the associations between individual differences in DD and the fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (fALFF) and resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) in 228 high school students using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-fMRI). At the regional level, we found an association between higher DD and greater fALFF in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), which is involved in conflict monitoring and strategy adaptation. At the connectivity level, DD was positively correlated with the RSFC between the dACC and the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), a critical functional circuit in the cognitive control network. Furthermore, these effects persisted even after adjusting for the influences of general intelligence and trait impulsivity. Overall, this study reveals the fALFF and RSFC as the functional brain basis of DD in late adolescents, aiding to strengthen and corroborate our understanding of the neural underpinnings of DD.", "A cross-lagged panel analysis of Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Fourth Edition (WISC-IV) intelligence test scores and reading and math achievement test scores of 337 students twice assessed for special education eligibility across a test-retest interval of 2.85 years was conducted. General intelligence (g) was loaded by the four WISC-IV factor index scores whereas reading and math were composite scores. After confirming measurement invariance, it was found that g, reading, and math were stable across time and synchronously correlated. The cross-lagged paths from g at time 1 to reading and math at time 2 (0.26 and 0.39, respectively) were both significantly greater than zero whereas the paths from reading and math at time 1 to g at time 2 (0.03 and 0.23, respectively) were not statistically significant. Given this pattern of relationships and extant research on the correlates of general intelligence, it was tentatively inferred that general intelligence was the temporal precursor to reading and math achievement.", "The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between the patient satisfaction and emotional intelligence skills of nurses working in the surgical clinic.\nThe study included two groups: a total of 79 nurses working for the surgical clinics of a university hospital in the city of Izmir and a total of 113 inpatients between January 1 and February 20, 2015. The nurses were asked to fill out the Emotional Intelligence Scale and a 12-question self-description form, while the patients were given the Scale of Satisfaction for Nursing Care and an 11-question self-description form.\nWe found a positive and statistically significant relationship between the satisfaction scores and emphatic concern, utilization of emotions, and emotional awareness subheadings of the patients (P<0.05).\nOur study results suggest that emotional intelligence should be one of the determinants of the objectives and that it should be recognized among the quality indicators to improve the quality of health care services.", "Deficient facial emotion recognition has been suggested to underlie aggression in individuals with antisocial personality disorder (ASPD). As the neuropeptide oxytocin (OT) has been shown to improve facial emotion recognition, it might also exert beneficial effects in individuals providing so much harm to the society. In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover trial, 22 individuals with ASPD and 29 healthy control (HC) subjects (matched for age, sex, intelligence, and education) were intranasally administered either OT (24 IU) or a placebo 45min before participating in an emotion classification paradigm with fearful, angry, and happy faces. We assessed the number of correct classifications and reaction times as indicators of emotion recognition ability. Significant group\u00d7substance\u00d7emotion interactions were found in correct classifications and reaction times. Compared to HC, individuals with ASPD showed deficits in recognizing fearful and happy faces; these group differences were no longer observable under OT. Additionally, reaction times for angry faces differed significantly between the ASPD and HC group in the placebo condition. This effect was mainly driven by longer reaction times in HC subjects after placebo administration compared to OT administration while individuals with ASPD revealed descriptively the contrary response pattern. Our data indicate an improvement of the recognition of fearful and happy facial expressions by OT in young adults with ASPD. Particularly the increased recognition of facial fear is of high importance since the correct perception of distress signals in others is thought to inhibit aggression. Beneficial effects of OT might be further mediated by improved recognition of facial happiness probably reflecting increased social reward responsiveness.", "Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) experience marked challenges with social function by definition, but few modifiable predictors of social functioning in ASD have been identified in extant research. This study hypothesized that deficits in social cognition and motor function may help to explain poor social functioning in individuals with ASD.\nCross-sectional data from 108 individuals with ASD and without intellectual disability ages 9 through 27.5 were used to assess the relationship between social cognition and motor function, and social functioning.\nResults of hierarchical multiple regression analyses revealed that greater social cognition, but not motor function, was significantly associated with better social functioning when controlling for sex, age, and intelligence quotient. Post-hoc analyses revealed that, better performance on second-order false belief tasks was associated with higher levels of socially adaptive behavior and lower levels of social problems.\nOur findings support the development and testing of interventions that target social cognition in order to improve social functioning in individuals with ASD. Interventions that teach generalizable skills to help people with ASD better understand social situations and develop competency in advanced perspective taking have the potential to create more durable change because their effects can be applied to a wide and varied set of situations and not simply a prescribed set of rehearsed situations.", "This article presents the findings from the first 3 years of a longitudinal study following a cohort of radiography and radiotherapy students through their qualification programs. The aim was to demonstrate any changes in emotional intelligence (EI) and to clarify the timing of any changes.\nThis was an international, longitudinal cohort study of student radiographers undertaking preregistration programs at four different higher education institutions. It was a survey design using a published and validated trait EI questionnaire. A mixed analysis of variance (Greenhouse-Geissler methods) was used with age and gender included in the models, as these were considered possible confounding factors. Sensitivity analysis was also applied because responses gradually reduced throughout the years.\nAcross the 3 years of the project, there were no statistically significant differences demonstrated in students' EI scores between countries or between years. The mean scores per year over time showed a small, but not statistically significant change within the second year of the study, when there was a slight fall in the mean scores. The sensitivity analysis showed that the characteristics of the questionnaire completer group was not significantly different to the noncompleter group.\nEI was not seen to change during the non-explicit EI content curricula within this study. The robustness of this finding falls away in the latter stages of this longitudinal study. Further research is recommended in curricula with explicit EI content. This study has provided a valuable benchmark for pre-explicit EI curricula.", "The present study investigated deficiencies in different components of emotional intelligence in borderline personality disorder (BPD).\nThe Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test (MSCEIT) and the Emotional Quotient Inventory (EQ-i) were used to assess EI dimensions. BPD patients (N\u00a0=\u00a085; 69 women; M\u00a0=\u00a033.6\u00a0years) were compared with Cluster C personality disorder (PD) patients (N\u00a0=\u00a039; 23 women; M\u00a0=\u00a036.6\u00a0years) and nonpatients (N\u00a0=\u00a069; 44 women; M\u00a0=\u00a035.6\u00a0years).\nCompared to the Cluster C PD patients and the nonpatient group, BPD patients displayed only deficits in their ability to understand emotions as measured with the Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test. The Emotional Quotient Inventory only revealed deficits in stress management in BPD patients compared to Cluster C PD patients.\nOur findings suggest that BPD patients have the ability to regulate emotions effectively, but they subjectively experience deficits in emotion regulation and therefore may not use this ability when they need it.", "Results from twin, family, and adoption studies all suggest that general intelligence is highly heritable. Several studies have shown lower premorbid intelligence in individuals before the onset of both mood disorders and psychosis, as well as in children and adolescents at genetic high risk for developing schizophrenia. Based on these findings, we aim to investigate if the association between educational achievement in parents and intelligence in their offspring is influenced by schizophrenia or mood disorder in parents. In a large population-based sample of young adult male conscripts (n\u00a0=\u00a0156,531) the presence of a mental disorder in the parents were associated with significantly lower offspring scores on a test of general intelligence, the B\u00f8rge Priens Pr\u00f8ve (BPP), and higher educational attainment in parents was significantly associated with higher BPP test scores in offspring. A significant interaction suggested that the positive association between maternal education and offspring intelligence was stronger in offspring of mothers with schizophrenia compared to the control group (p\u00a0=\u00a00.03). The associations between parental education and offspring intelligence are also observed when restricting the sample to conscripts whose parents are diagnosed after 30\u00a0years of age. In conclusion, findings from this study show a more positive effect of education on offspring intelligence in mothers with schizophrenia compared to mothers from the control group. This effect could have both environmental and genetic explanations.", "We present a design study of the TensorFlow Graph Visualizer, part of the TensorFlow machine intelligence platform. This tool helps users understand complex machine learning architectures by visualizing their underlying dataflow graphs. The tool works by applying a series of graph transformations that enable standard layout techniques to produce a legible interactive diagram. To declutter the graph, we decouple non-critical nodes from the layout. To provide an overview, we build a clustered graph using the hierarchical structure annotated in the source code. To support exploration of nested structure on demand, we perform edge bundling to enable stable and responsive cluster expansion. Finally, we detect and highlight repeated structures to emphasize a model's modular composition. To demonstrate the utility of the visualizer, we describe example usage scenarios and report user feedback. Overall, users find the visualizer useful for understanding, debugging, and sharing the structures of their models.", "Artificial intelligence such as deep neural networks exhibited remarkable performance in simulated video games and 'Go'. In contrast, most humanoid robots in the DARPA Robotics Challenge fell down to ground. The dramatic contrast in performance is mainly due to differences in the amount of training data, which is huge and small, respectively. Animals are not allowed with millions of the failed trials, which lead to injury and death. Humans fall only several thousand times before they balance and walk. We hypothesize that a unique closed-loop neural circuit formed by the Purkinje cells, the cerebellar deep nucleus and the inferior olive in and around the cerebellum and the highest density of gap junctions, which regulate synchronous activities of the inferior olive nucleus, are computational machinery for learning from a small sample. We discuss recent experimental and computational advances associated with this hypothesis.", "This special issue aimed to contribute to the unification of two disciplines focusing on cognition and intelligence: the psychology of cognitive development and the psychology of intelligence. The general principles of the organization and development of human intelligence are discussed first. Each paper is then summarized and discussed vis-\u00e0-vis these general principles. The implications for major theories of cognitive development and intelligence are briefly discussed.", "Childhood obesity may lead to neuronal impairment in both the peripheral and the central nervous system. This study aimed to investigate the impact of obesity and insulin resistance (IR) on the central nervous system and neurocognitive functions in children.\nSeventy-three obese children (38 male and 35 female) and 42 healthy children (21 male and 21 female) were recruited. Standard biochemical indices and IR were evaluated. The Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised (WISC-R) and electroencephalography (EEG) were administered to all participants. The obese participants were divided into two groups based on the presence or absence of IR, and the data were compared between the subgroups.\nOnly verbal scores on the WISC-R in the IR+ group were significantly lower than those of the control and IR- groups. There were no differences between the groups with respect to other parameters of the WISC-R or the EEG. Verbal scores of the WISC-R were negatively correlated with obesity duration and homeostatic model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) values. EEGs showed significantly more frequent 'slowing during hyperventilation' (SDHs) in obese children than non-obese children.\nNeurocognitive functions, particularly verbal abilities, were impaired in obese children with IR. An early examination of cognitive functions may help identify and correct such abnormalities in obese children.", "The objective of this article is to unveil the ways in which the emotional intelligence (EI) of a young person is linked with subjective assessment of physical state, depressiveness, anxiety, and psychological well-being, as well as to determine whether these factors are reliable predictors of EI constituents.\nThe study was conducted using an original EI test (EI-DARL-V1/V2), which consisted of a traditional 73-item questionnaire; tasks of emotional, social and interpersonal situations; and identification of emotions in facial expressions (pictures). Questionnaire items were multiplexed into 5 subscales using multi-step factor analysis. Special questionnaires were devised and presented to participants together with the EI questionnaire in order to assess subjective assessment of physical and mental health, depressiveness, anxiety, and psychological well-being. There were 1430 participants from various regions of Lithuania who participated in the study. The age of participants varied from 17 to 27 years.\nEstablished inverse linear correlation showed that those participants who experienced certain somatic symptoms or unpleasant psychological states had lower EI; a particularly strong correlation was observed between poor subjective assessment of health and understanding and control of one's own emotions. Depressed and anxious participants possessed poorer understanding and ability to regulate emotions of others as well as their own. Also, these participants performed worse when resolving emotional, social, and interpersonal situations. A direct relationship between EI and psychological well-being was established according to three EI indexes i.e. (a) understanding of own emotions; (b) understanding of emotions of other people; (c) control of emotions of others. As perception of psychological well-being increased, participants were able to understand emotions of others better and demonstrated even better ability to understand and control their own emotions. The study failed to determine whether emotion recognition from non-verbal signs (face pictures) was related to at least one of the previously mentioned indexes.\nThe study revealed that the factors such as subjective assessment of physical and mental health, depressiveness, anxiety, and psychological well-being were reliable predictors of certain EI indexes.", "The authors compared the IQ and academic achievement of adolescents with craniofacial microsomia (cases) and unaffected children (controls). Among cases, the authors analyzed cognitive functioning by facial phenotype.\nThe authors administered standardized tests of intelligence, reading, spelling, writing, and mathematics to 142 cases and 316 controls recruited from 26 cities across the United States and Canada. Phenotypic classification was based on integrated data from photographic images, health history, and medical chart reviews. Hearing screens were conducted for all participants.\nAfter adjustment for demographics, cases' average scores were lower than those of controls on all measures, but the magnitude of differences was small (standardized effect sizes, -0.01 to -0.3). There was little evidence that hearing status modified case-control group differences (Wald p > 0.05 for all measures). Twenty-five percent of controls and 38 percent of cases were classified as having learning problems (adjusted OR, 1.5; 95 percent CI, 0.9 to 2.4). Comparison of cases with and without learning problems indicated that those with learning problems were more likely to be male, Hispanic, and to come from lower income, bilingual families. Analyses by facial phenotype showed that case-control group differences were largest for cases with both microtia and mandibular hypoplasia (effect sizes, -0.02 to -0.6).\nThe highest risk of cognitive-academic problems was observed in patients with combined microtia and mandibular hypoplasia. Developmental surveillance of this subgroup is recommended, especially in the context of high socioeconomic risk and bilingual families. Given the early stage of research on craniofacial microsomia and neurodevelopment, replication of these findings is needed.\nRisk, II.", "Most individuals have reliable long-term memories for the pitch of familiar music recordings. This pitch memory (1) appears to be normally distributed in the population, (2) does not depend on explicit musical training and (3) only seems to be weakly related to differences in listening frequency estimates. The present experiment was designed to assess whether individual differences in auditory working memory could explain variance in long-term pitch memory for music recordings. In Experiment 1, participants first completed a musical note adjustment task that has been previously used to assess working memory of musical pitch. Afterward, participants were asked to judge the pitch of well-known music recordings, which either had or had not been shifted in pitch. We found that performance on the pitch working memory task was significantly related to performance in the pitch memory task using well-known recordings, even when controlling for overall musical experience and familiarity with each recording. In Experiment 2, we replicated these findings in a separate group of participants while additionally controlling for fluid intelligence and non-pitch-based components of auditory working memory. In Experiment 3, we demonstrated that participants could not accurately judge the pitch of unfamiliar recordings, suggesting that our method of pitch shifting did not result in unwanted acoustic cues that could have aided participants in Experiments 1 and 2. These results, taken together, suggest that the ability to maintain pitch information in working memory might lead to more accurate long-term pitch memory.", "Oral propranolol is considered the first choice for the treatment of infantile hemangiomas (IHs). There is a concern that administering propranolol in newborns and infants could induce adverse effects in learning and memory processes in the long term. The purpose of this study was to assess cognitive and memory functions in children who had been treated with propranolol for IH during their infancy.\nA total of 23 children between 5 and 7.5\u00a0years of age who had been treated with oral propranolol for IH during infancy were tested for cognitive functions with the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence, Fourth Edition (WPPSI-IV) test and for memory functions with the Test of Memory and Learning (TOMAL).\nComparison of our sample with a normal distribution by a Shapiro-Wilk W test showed no significant difference for any of the composite scores in the WPPSI-IV and TOMAL tests except for positive asymmetry and concentration of scores around average (p = 0.01) in the WPPSI-IV composite score (mean intelligence), due to one atypically high score.\nThe distribution of scores for intelligence and memory scales in our study population was similar to that in the reference general population. These results fail to support any significant disturbance in intelligence and memory development in children treated during infancy with propranolol for IH.", "The article introduces an ambient intelligence system for blind people which besides providing assistance in home environment also helps with various situations and roles in which blind people may find themselves involved. RUDO, the designed system, comprises several modules that mainly support or ensure recognition of approaching people, alerting to other household members' movement in the flat, work on a computer, supervision of (sighted) children, cooperation of a sighted and a blind person (e.g., when studying), control of heating and zonal regulation by a blind person. It has a unified user interface that gives the blind person access to individual functions. The interface for blind people offers assistance with work on a computer, including writing in Braille on a regular keyboard and specialized work in informatics and electronics (e.g., programming). RUDO can complement the standard aids used by blind people at home, it increases their independence and creates conditions that allow them to become fully involved. RUDO also supports blind people sharing a home with sighted people, which contributes to their feeling of security and greater inclusion in society. RUDO has been implemented in a household for two years, which allows an evaluation of its use in practice.", "Crack-cocaine addiction is an important public health problem worldwide. Although there is not a consensus, preliminary evidence has suggested that cognitive impairments in patients with crack-cocaine dependence persist during abstinence, affecting different neuropsychological domains. However, few studies have prospectively evaluated those deficits in different phases of abstinence.\nThe main aim of present study was to examine neuropsychological performance of patients with crack-cocaine dependence during early abstinence and after four weeks, comparing with matched controls.\nThirty-five males with crack-cocaine dependence, aged 18 to 50years, who met DSM-IV criteria for cocaine dependence and a control group of 33 healthy men were enrolled. They were assessed through Block Design, Digit Span and Vocabulary of Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS-III), the Rey Auditory Learning Test (RAVLT) and the Verbal Fluency (FAS) between 3 and 10days (mean of 6.1\u00b12.0days) and after 4weeks of abstinence.\nCompared to controls, the crack-cocaine dependent group exhibited deficits in cognitive performance affecting attention, verbal memory and learning tasks in early withdrawal. Most of the cognitive deficits persisted after four weeks of abstinence.\nPresent results observed that the group of patients with crack-cocaine dependence presented persistent deficits affecting memory and attention even after four weeks of abstinence, confirming previous studies that had disclosed such cognitive impairments.", "We aimed to apply collaborative business intelligence (BI) system to hospital supply, processing and distribution (SPD) logistics management model.\nWe searched Engineering Village database, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) and Google for articles (Published from 2011 to 2016), books, Web pages, etc., to understand SPD and BI related theories and recent research status. For the application of collaborative BI technology in the hospital SPD logistics management model, we realized this by leveraging data mining techniques to discover knowledge from complex data and collaborative techniques to improve the theories of business process.\nFor the application of BI system, we: (i) proposed a layered structure of collaborative BI system for intelligent management in hospital logistics; (ii) built data warehouse for the collaborative BI system; (iii) improved data mining techniques such as supporting vector machines (SVM) and swarm intelligence firefly algorithm to solve key problems in hospital logistics collaborative BI system; (iv) researched the collaborative techniques oriented to data and business process optimization to improve the business processes of hospital logistics management.\nProper combination of SPD model and BI system will improve the management of logistics in the hospitals. The successful implementation of the study requires: (i) to innovate and improve the traditional SPD model and make appropriate implement plans and schedules for the application of BI system according to the actual situations of hospitals; (ii) the collaborative participation of internal departments in hospital including the department of information, logistics, nursing, medical and financial; (iii) timely response of external suppliers.", "Over 100 years have passed since Binet and Simon proposed scales for assessment of intelligence of children to predict academic success and failure. The extension of these assessments to adults largely resulted from efforts of psychologists to provide insights for military selection in World War I. At the time, relatively little thought was given to how adult intelligence might differ from child and adolescent intelligence. Traditional approaches for assessing adult intelligence have largely survived. However, there is little reference to adult intellectual functioning outside of laboratory-based tasks and clinical assessments of pathology. The result is that there are insufficient criterion measures for adult intelligence. Moreover, researchers have shifted from treating intelligence tests as predictors to treating them as criterion measures. The result is a disconnection between basic research on one hand and understanding adult intelligence on the other hand. This lack of connection is a serious impediment for predicting individual differences in performance on tasks which adults perform in their day-to-day work and nonwork lives. This article explores how the field has come to the current situation, and what remedies might be explored. Ultimately, a fundamental reexamination of how adult intelligence is studied and applied is suggested.", "This study examined visual, spatial-sequential, and spatial-simultaneous working memory (WM) performance in children with mathematical learning disability (MLD) and low mathematics achievement (LMA) compared with typically developing (TD) children. Groups were matched on reading decoding performance and verbal intelligence. Besides statistical significance testing, we used bootstrap confidence interval estimation and computed effect sizes. Children were individually tested with six computerized tasks, two for each visuospatial WM subcomponent. We found that both MLD and LMA children had low visuospatial WM function in both spatial-simultaneous and spatial-sequential WM tasks. The WM deficit was most expressed in MLD children and less in LMA children. This suggests that WM scores are distributed along a continuum with TD children achieving top scores and MLD children achieving low scores. The theoretical and practical significance of findings is discussed. Statement of Contribution What is already known on this subject? Working memory plays an important role in mathematical achievement. Children with mathematical learning disability (MLD) usually have low working memory resources. Conflicting results have been reported concerning the role of VSWM in individuals with MLD. What the present study adds? Children with different degree of impairment in math achievement and typically developing children were tested. Visual, spatial-sequential, and spatial-simultaneous working memory tasks were examined. Only spatial-sequential and spatial-simultaneous working memory tasks discriminated the two impairments groups.", "As proton radiotherapy (RT) remains a limited resource, predictive estimates of the potential reduction in adverse treatment-related outcomes compared to photon RT could potentially help improve treatment selection. The aim of this study was to predict the magnitude of the neurocognitive and hearing deficits associated with proton and photon RT for children with brain tumors. The existing RT plans for 50 children treated with photon intensity modulated RT were compared with generated intensity modulated proton RT plans. The proton and photon RT dose distribution was used to estimate the Full Scale Intelligence Quotient (IQ) via a Monte Carlo model and the probability of hearing loss per ear, based on previously published dose-risk relationships. Compared to photon plans, the mean brain dose was found to be reduced in all proton plans, translating into a gain of [Formula: see text] IQ points for the whole cohort at 5\u00a0years post-RT for dose regimens of 54\u00a0Gy, or [Formula: see text] IQ points for dose regimens of 59.4\u00a0Gy, where the errors shown represent statistical and systematic uncertainties. The probability of hearing loss \u226520\u00a0dB per ear was less for proton versus photon RT: overall (9\u2009\u00b1\u20094) versus (17\u2009\u00b1\u20096)%, respectively, based on dose regimens of 54\u00a0Gy, and (13\u2009\u00b1\u20095) versus (23\u2009\u00b1\u20099)% for dose regimens of 59.4\u00a0Gy. Proton RT is thus expected to reduce the detrimental effect of RT upon IQ and hearing as compared to photon RT for pediatric brain tumors.", "Survival of extremely preterm (EP; <28 weeks' gestation) infants has increased over the last 2 decades. Equivalent reductions in developmental morbidity in early childhood have not been consistently reported. The aim of this study was to determine trends in neurodevelopmental outcomes at 8 years of age of children born EP (22-27 completed weeks' gestation) over the past 2 decades.\nPopulation-based cohorts of all EP survivors born in the state of Victoria, Australia in 1991-1992, 1997, and 2005 were recruited at birth. At 8 years of age, general intelligence (IQ), academic achievement, and neurosensory status were assessed. Major neurosensory disability was defined as any of moderate or severe cerebral palsy, IQ <-2 SD relative to term controls, blindness, or deafness.\nRates of major neurosensory disability were similar in all eras (1991-1992, 18%; 1997, 15%; 2005, 18%), as were rates of IQ <-2 SD, cerebral palsy, blindness, and deafness. Mean z scores for IQ were similar across eras, but there was some evidence that scores for academic achievement were lower in 2005 than in 1997, and the odds of having academic problems were higher in 2005 than in both earlier eras. These outcomes were not explained by differences in known perinatal care or sociodemographic variables between eras.\nContrary to expectations, rates of major neurosensory disability have not improved, and academic performance is poorer at early school age in 2005 than in earlier eras for EP children born in the state of Victoria, Australia.", "Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a clinically heterogeneous condition and identification of clinically meaningful subgroups would open up a new window for personalized medicine. Thus, we aimed to identify new clinical phenotypes in children and adolescents with ADHD and to investigate whether neuroimaging findings validate the identified phenotypes. Neuroimaging and clinical data from 67 children with ADHD and 62 typically developing controls (TDCs) from the ADHD-200 database were selected. Clinical measures of ADHD symptoms and intelligence quotient (IQ) were used as input features into a topological data analysis (TDA) to identify ADHD subgroups within our sample. As external validators, graph theoretical measures obtained from the functional connectome were compared to address the biological meaningfulness of the identified subtypes. The TDA identified two unique subgroups of ADHD, labelled as mild symptom ADHD (mADHD) and severe symptom ADHD (sADHD). The output topology shape was repeatedly observed in the independent validation dataset. The graph theoretical analysis showed a decrease in the degree centrality and PageRank in the bilateral posterior cingulate cortex in the sADHD group compared with the TDC group. The mADHD group showed similar patterns of intra- and inter-module connectivity to the sADHD group. Relative to the TDC group, the inter-module connectivity between the default mode network and executive control network were significantly increased in the sADHD group but not in the mADHD group. Taken together, our results show that the data-driven TDA is potentially useful in identifying objective and biologically relevant disease phenotypes in children and adolescents with ADHD.", "In this chapter, I reflect on contemporary entanglements between artificial intelligence and the neurosciences by tracing the development of Google's recent DeepMind algorithms back to their roots in neuroscientific studies of episodic memory and imagination. Google promotes a new form of \"infrastructural intelligence,\" which excels by constantly reassessing its cognitive architecture in exchange with a cloud of data that surrounds it, and exhibits putatively human capacities such as intuition. I argue that such (re)alignments of biological and artificial intelligence have been enabled by a paradigmatic infrastructuralization of the brain in contemporary neuroscience. This infrastructuralization is based in methodologies that epistemically liken the brain to complex systems of an entirely different scale (i.e., global logistics) and has given rise to diverse research efforts that target the neuronal infrastructures of higher cognitive functions such as empathy and creativity. What is at stake in this process is no less than the shape of brains to come and a revised understanding of the intelligent and creative social subject.", "Occupational noise frequently occurs in the work environment in military intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance operations. This impacts cognitive performance by acting as a stressor, potentially interfering with the analysts' decision-making process. We investigated the effects of different noise stimuli on analysts' performance and workload in anomaly detection by simulating a noisy work environment. We utilized functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to quantify oxy-hemoglobin (HbO) and deoxy-hemoglobin concentration changes in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), as well as behavioral measures, which include eye tracking, reaction time, and accuracy rate. We hypothesized that noisy environments would have a negative effect on the participant in terms of anomaly detection performance due to the increase in workload, which would be reflected by an increase in PFC activity. We found that HbO for some of the channels analyzed were significantly different across noise types ([Formula: see text]). Our results also indicated that HbO activation for short-intermittent noise stimuli was greater in the PFC compared to long-intermittent noises. These approaches using fNIRS in conjunction with an understanding of the impact on human analysts in anomaly detection could potentially lead to better performance by optimizing work environments.", "Background. Understanding preventable causes of neurodevelopmental disorders is a public health priority. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) from combustion of fossil fuel, lead, and mercury are among known neurodevelopmental toxicants. Method. For the first time, we comprehensively review the findings from a study by the Columbia Center for Children's Environmental Health and Chinese partners that followed 2 groups of mother-child pairs, one from 2002 and another from 2005, in Tongliang County, China. Pregnant mothers in the 2 cohorts experienced different exposure to PAH because a local coal-burning power plant was shut down in 2004. Investigators assessed change in prenatal PAH exposure, measured using a biomarker (benzo[a]pyrene [BaP]-DNA adducts in cord blood). Developmental quotients were measured using the Gesell Developmental Scales at age 2 and IQ was assessed using the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children at age 5. Biologic markers of preclinical response were measured in cord blood: methylation status of long interspersed nuclear elements (LINE1), an indicator of genomic stability, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a neuronal growth promoter. Analyses accounted for co-exposure to lead and mercury. Results. BaP-DNA adducts were significantly inversely associated with Gesell Developmental Scales scores in the first cohort but not in the second cohort; and levels of BDNF and LINE1 methylation were higher in the second cohort. Conclusion. In this study, reduced exposure to PAH was associated with beneficial effects on neurodevelopment as well as molecular changes related to improved brain development and health. These benefits should encourage further efforts to limit exposure to these toxic pollutants.", "This study examined nonverbal intelligence and scholastic achievement in children with type 1 diabetes. In a retrospective case-control study, 69 children (35 males) ages 5-10\u2009years with type 1 diabetes and 69 healthy controls matched to patients by age, gender and socioeconomic status were compared according to their performance on Raven's Coloured Progressive Matrices and their scholastic grades. No differences in nonverbal intelligence and grades were observed between children with type 1 diabetes and healthy control subjects. Raven's Coloured Progressive Matrices scores inversely correlated with duration of illness both in children with early onset of type 1 diabetes and poor metabolic control. Possible explanations of the results and implications are discussed.", "Pilots' mental health is an issue of crucial importance that may endanger flight safety. As such, it is of profound significance to address the question of what characteristics are protective of mental health among pilots. The present study aimed to explore the indirect effects of emotional intelligence (EI) on depression and anxiety via proactive coping, and examine the moderating role of previous flight experience (PFE) in the conditional indirect effect of EI on depression through proactive coping.\nA cross-sectional regression design was used to measure EI (Trait Meta Mood Scale), proactive coping (Proactive Coping Scale), depression (The PHQ-9), and anxiety (The GAD-7) among 319 Chinese civil pilots from China Southern Airlines. Mediation and moderated mediation effects were explored using regression analyses and were confirmed by the bootstrapping approach.\nPilots reported relatively low levels of depression (M = 0.39, SD = 0.24) and anxiety (M = 0.22, SD = 0.23). Married pilots had higher levels of depression (t = 2.46) and anxiety (t = 3.07) than single pilots. Proactive coping mediated the association between EI and depression (B = -0.25), as well as the relationship between EI and anxiety (B = -0.23). Moreover, conditional process analysis showed that PFE moderated the indirect effect of EI on depression through proactive coping (b3 = 0.005), in which simple slope analysis showed a stronger mediating effect for pilots with more PFE (simple slope = -0.14).\nThe results showed that EI and proactive coping had protective potential in the prevention of depression and anxiety. Implications for the promotion of mental health and diminishing depression and anxiety among pilots are discussed.Guo Y, Ji M, You X, Huang J.

The objective of this study was to identify and to examine the characteristics of top 100 cited articles in the field of Medical Informatics based on data acquired from the Thomson Reuters' Web of Science (WOS) in October, 2016. The data was collected using two procedures: first we included articles published in the 24 journals listed in the \"Medical Informatics\" category; second, we retrieved articles using the key words: \"informatics\", \"medical informatics\", \"bi\ufeffomedical informatics\",\u00a0\"clinical informatics\"\u00a0and \"health informatics\". After removing duplicate records, articles were ranked by the number of citations they received. When the 100 top cited articles had been identified, we collected the following information for each record: all WOS database citations, year of publication, journal, author names, authors' affiliation, country of origin and topics indexed for each record. Citations for the top 100 articles ranged from 346 to 7875, and citations per year ranged from 11.12 to 525. The majority of articles were published in the 2000s (n=43) and 1990s (n=38). Articles were published across 10 journals, most commonly Statistics in medicine (n=71) and Medical decision making (n=28). The articles had an average of 2.47 authors. Statistics and biostatistics modeling was the most common topic (n=71), followed by artificial intelligence (n=12), and medical errors (n=3), other topics included data mining, diagnosis, bioinformatics, information retrieval, and medical imaging. Our bibliometric analysis illustrated a historical perspective on the progress of scientific research on Medical Informatics. Moreover, the findings of the current study provide an insight on the frequency of citations for top cited articles published in Medical Informatics as well as quality of the works, journals, and the trends steering Medical Informatics.", "A substantial literature has investigated relations between intelligence and psychopathic traits. At the construct level, findings have been mixed, with a small negative relation found. At the facet level however, a positive relation between verbal intelligence and the interpersonal facet of psychopathy, and a negative relation between verbal intelligence and the lifestyle factor of psychopathy emerge. To date, this research has largely neglected adolescents and prior research has focused on clinical and incarcerated populations, while failing to control for psychopathology. The current study sought to address these limitations by examining the relation between intelligence and psychopathy at the construct, facet, and trait level in a sample of inpatient adolescents. At the bivariate level, verbal intelligence was related to dishonest charm, unemotionality, impulsiveness, and manipulation. In regression analyses, however, verbal intelligence lost significance as a predictor of all but impulsiveness. Gender and severity of psychopathology accounted for most significant relations.", "The paper presents the profile of the psychologist, Ludwika Karpi\u0144ska-Woyczy\u0144ska, the first Polish woman who acted for the popularisation of psychoanalysis and experimental psychology. Karpi\u0144ska belonged to the first generation of the \"Polish Freudians\", a group which also involved Ludwik Jekels, Stefan Borowiecki, Herman Nunberg, Jan Nelken and Karol de Beaurain. Karpi\u0144ska's difficult path to gain higher education will be presented. Thepaper lays an emphasis on Karpi\u0144ska's contribution to the development of the international psychoanalysis and offers an overview of her most significant psychoanalytic publications (Polish and foreign ones) up to the outbreak of World War I. It demonstrates her participation in scientific conferences and collaboration with the most important psychoanalytical centres in Zurich and Vienna together with their representatives (Jung, Freud, Jekels) drawing simultaneous attention to the broader historical background of the presented events. Karpi\u0144ska's post-war work was inextricably linked to the research on intelligence quotient of children and youth and psychotechnical studies. Furthermore, the paper illustrates the activities of the Municipal Psychological Lab in Lodz, where Karpi\u0144ska was a Head between 1920 and 1930, as well as her scientific achievements in intelligence quotient research, most significant publications of 1921-1930, her collaboration with foreign centres of a similar profile and the efforts she made to establish the Vocational Guidance Service.", "Long-term cognitive outcome and treatment of adult early treated (ET)PKU patients is a main issue in PKU research. We questioned whether the intellectual development of ETPKU patients is stable and to what extent its variation may be predicted by the quality of metabolic control. The aims of the present longitudinal retrospective study were to assess in young adult ETPKU patients: i) the relationship between IQ and metabolic control during the first two decades of life; and ii) the intra- and interindividual variability in the developmental trajectory which cannot be predicted by the disease's biomarkers. We collected biochemical data from 65 ETPKU patients (diagnostic blood Phe\u00a0>\u00a0360\u00a0\u03bcmol/l) who were assessed twice for IQ (Wechsler Intelligence Scale) during their lifetime (mean age: 10.2 and 19.6\u00a0years, respectively). Results show that in ETPKU patients IQ over the second decade of life remained stable in about half of the patients (51%); while the rest experienced a gain (7 to 15 points) or loss (7 to 28 points) in IQ scores (23 and 26% respectively) whatever the quality of metabolic control was. The main factor affecting the second IQ was the value of the first IQ (p\u00a0<\u00a00.000) whose effect overruled that of the markers of metabolic control. Looking at the developmental trajectory of our ETPKU patients, the present study disclosed a remarkable interindividual variability in their cognitive outcome and also an inconsistent linkage between cognitive performances and biochemical control, thus supporting the hypothesis of an individual resilience or vulnerability to Phe in young adult ETPKU.", "Chronic kidney disease is a progressive disease, which terminates in end-stage renal diseases (ESRD) that requires either dialysis or kidney transplantation for the patient to survive. There is an alarming trend in the disparities of ESRD in African Americans (AAs). Currently, AAs represent more than 30% of incident ESRD cases, yet they constitute 15% of the overall US population. Despite the reductions in mortality, increases in access to patient-centered home dialysis and preemptive kidney transplantation for the overall US ESRD population over the last decade, disparities in the care of AAs with ESRD remain largely unaffected.\nThis review discusses patient-, community-, and practitioner-related factors that contribute to disparities in ESRD care for AAs. In particular, the review addresses issues related to end-of-life support, the importance of Apolipoprotein-1 gene variants, and the advent of pharmacogenomics toward achieving precision care. The need for accessible clinical intelligence for the ESRD population is discussed. Several interventions and a call to action to address the disparities are presented. Key Messages: Significant disparities in ESRD care exist for AAs. Strategies to enhance patient engagement, education, accountable partnerships, and clinical intelligence may reduce these disparities.", "Although individual differences in fluid reasoning reliably mediate predictions of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms from birth weight in youth with typical cognitive development (TD), it is unknown if this indirect effect operates similarly in the development of ADHD symptoms secondary to intellectual disability (ID). Thus, we evaluated mediation by fluid reasoning in a longitudinal sample of 163 youth (45% female) with (n\u00a0=\u00a052) or without (n\u00a0=\u00a0111) ID who were followed prospectively from age 5 to age 13. At age 9, youth completed the Arithmetic subtest of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, a measure of fluid reasoning. At ages 9 and 13, mothers and teachers separately rated youth ADHD symptoms and mothers completed a diagnostic interview. Mediation was tested via path analysis with bootstrapped confidence intervals, and moderated mediation estimated whether indirect effects differed between ID and TD youth or based on youth IQ. Controlling for demographic factors and age 9 ADHD symptoms, age 9 Arithmetic mediated birth weight and multi-method/informant age 13 ADHD symptoms, such that birth weight positively predicted Arithmetic, which negatively predicted ADHD symptoms. Neither ID status nor IQ moderated the observed indirect effect through Arithmetic, suggesting that it was similar for ID and TD youth as well as across the range of youth IQs. These findings support previous evidence that fluid reasoning, as measured by Arithmetic, may causally mediate birth weight and ADHD symptoms, and suggest that this pathway operates similarly with respect to the development of ADHD symptoms in youth with ID.", "The Cognitive Estimation Test (CET) is a widely used test to investigate estimation abilities requiring complex processes such as reasoning, the development and application of appropriate strategies, response plausibility checking as well as general knowledge and numeracy (e.g., Shallice and Evans, 1978; MacPherson et al., 2014). Thus far, it remains unknown whether the CET is both sensitive and specific to frontal lobe dysfunction. Neuroimaging techniques may not represent a useful methodology for answering this question since the complex processes involved are likely to be associated with a large network of brain regions, some of which are not functionally necessary to successfully carry out the CET. Instead, neuropsychological studies may represent a more promising investigation tool for identifying the brain areas necessary for CET performance. We recently developed two new versions of the CET (CET-A and CET-B; MacPherson et al., 2014). We investigated the overall performance and conducted an error analysis on CET-A in patients with focal, unilateral, frontal (n = 38) or posterior (n = 22) lesions and healthy controls (n = 39). We found that frontal patients' performance was impaired compared to healthy controls on CET. We also found that frontal patients generated significantly poorer estimates than posterior patients on CET-A. This could not be explained by impairments in fluid intelligence. The error analyses suggested that for CET-A, extreme and very extreme responses are impaired following frontal lobe damage. However, only very extreme responses are significantly more impaired following frontal lobe than posterior damage and so represent a measure restricted to frontal \"executive\" impairment, in addition to overall CET performance.", "Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is biologically heterogeneous, with different biological predispositions - mediated through developmental processes - converging upon a common clinical phenotype. Brain imaging studies have variably shown altered brain structure, activity and connectivity in children and adults with ADHD. Recent methodological developments allow for the integration of information across imaging modalities, potentially yielding a more coherent view regarding the biology underlying the disorder.\nWe analyzed a sample of adults with persistent ADHD and healthy controls using an advanced multimodal linked independent component analysis approach. Diffusion and structural MRI data were fused to form imaging markers reflecting independent components that explain variation across modalities. We included these markers as predictors into logistic regression models on adult ADHD and put those into context with predictions of estimated intelligence, age and sex.\nWe included 87 adults with ADHD and 93 controls in our analysis. Participants' courses associated with all imaging markers explained 27.86% of the variance in adult ADHD. No single imaging modality dominated this result. Instead, it was explained by aggregation of relatively small effects across several modalities and markers. One of the top markers for adult ADHD was multimodal and linked to morphological and microstructural effects within anterior temporal brain regions; another was linked to cortical thickness. Several markers were also influenced by estimated intelligence, age and/or sex.\nAlthough complex analytical approaches, such as the one applied here, provide insight into otherwise hidden mechanisms, they also increase the complexity of interpretations.\nNo dominant imaging modality or marker characterizes structural brain phenotypes in adults with ADHD, but we can refine our characterization of the disorder by the integration of small effects across modalities.", "Emotional intelligence has been shown to affect academic performance and perceived stress. But conflicting reports suggest that the relationship between academic performance and emotional intelligence may not be straightforward. Hence, this study explored the relationship between emotional intelligence, perceived stress and academic performance.\nFirst year medical students were invited to participate in this longitudinal study. At Time 1, before mid-semester examinations, they completed the questionnaires on Schutte's Emotional Intelligence Scale (SEIS) and Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) (n\u00a0=\u00a0213). At Time 2, before pre university examinations, students again completed perceived stress scale questionnaire. (n\u00a0=\u00a0138). Academic performance was reported using summative assessment at both T1 and T2. The relationship between academic performance, emotional intelligence and perceived stress was explored using regression analysis.\nNeither PSS nor SEIS were related to academic performance. However, perceived stress was significantly predicted by SEIS both at T1 (r\u00a0=\u00a00.333, \u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.149, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) as well as T2 (r\u00a0=\u00a00.240, \u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.116, p\u00a0=\u00a00.028). The results were cross-validated at student level both at T1 and at T2.\nMedical students with higher trait emotional intelligence perceived lesser stress. Therefore, it might be prudent to train medical students to increase their emotional intelligence to promote their well-being.", "Down syndrome results in neuromotor impairment that affects selective motor control, compromising the acquisition of motor skills and functional independence. The aim of the proposed study is to evaluate and compare the effects of multiple-monopolar anodal transcranial direct current stimulation and sham stimulation over the primary motor cortex during upper limb motor training involving virtual reality on motor control, muscle activity, cerebral activity and functional independence.\nA randomised, controlled, double-blind, clinical trial is proposed. The calculation of the sample size will be defined based on the results of a pilot study involving the same methods. The participants will be randomly allocated to two groups. Evaluations will be conducted before and after the intervention as well as 1\u2009month after the end of the intervention process. At each evaluation, three-dimensional analysis of upper limb movement muscle activity will be measured using electromyography, cerebral activity will be measured using an electroencephalogram system and intellectual capacity will be assessed using the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children. Virtual reality training will be performed three times a week (one 20\u2009min session per day) for a total of 10 sessions. During the protocol, transcranial stimulation will be administered concomitantly to upper limb motor training. The results will be analysed statistically, with a p value\u22640.05 considered indicative of statistical significance.\nThe present study received approval from the Institutional Review Board of Universidade Nove de Julho (Sao Paulo,Brazil) under process number 1.540.113 and is registered with the Brazilian Registry of Clinical Trials (N\u00b0 RBR3PHPXB). The participating institutions have presented a declaration of participation. The volunteers will be permitted to drop out of the study at any time with no negative repercussions. The results will be published and will contribute evidence regarding the use of this type of intervention on children.", "The use of intelligent techniques in medicine has brought a ray of hope in terms of treating leukaemia patients. Personalized treatment uses patient's genetic profile to select a mode of treatment. This process makes use of molecular technology and machine learning, to determine the most suitable approach to treating a leukaemia patient. Until now, no reviews have been published from a computational perspective concerning the development of personalized medicine intelligent techniques for leukaemia patients using molecular data analysis. This review studies the published empirical research on personalized medicine in leukaemia and synthesizes findings across studies related to intelligence techniques in leukaemia, with specific attention to particular categories of these studies to help identify opportunities for further research into personalized medicine support systems in chronic myeloid leukaemia. A systematic search was carried out to identify studies using intelligence techniques in leukaemia and to categorize these studies based on leukaemia type and also the task, data source, and purpose of the studies. Most studies used molecular data analysis for personalized medicine, but future advancement for leukaemia patients requires molecular models that use advanced machine-learning methods to automate decision-making in treatment management to deliver supportive medical information to the patient in clinical practice.", "The problem of non-iterative one-shot and non-destructive correction of unavoidable mistakes arises in all Artificial Intelligence applications in the real world. Its solution requires robust separation of samples with errors from samples where the system works properly. We demonstrate that in (moderately) high dimension this separation could be achieved with probability close to one by linear discriminants. Based on fundamental properties of measure concentration, we show that for M<aexp(bn) random M-element sets in Rn are linearly separable with probability p, p>1-\u03d1, where 1>\u03d1>0 is a given small constant. Exact values of a,b>0 depend on the probability distribution that determines how the random M-element sets are drawn, and on the constant \u03d1. These stochastic separation theorems provide a new instrument for the development, analysis, and assessment of machine learning methods and algorithms in high dimension. Theoretical statements are illustrated with numerical examples.", "Patients with drug refractory epilepsy (DRE) and a high level of education may differ in their language recovery after surgery. Our aim was to determine whether there were differences in the extent of improvement and pattern of reorganization of language functions on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) after surgery to treat refractory temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) between patients with more than 12 years of formal education versus those with a shorter period of regular schooling.\nAfter approval by an institutional ethics committee, 60 right-handed, adult patients of left TLE and 20 right-handed, healthy controls were recruited to the study. Multiple aspects of language (Repetition, Naming, Word fluency, Visual word and Comprehension reading) were tested using the Indian Aphasia Battery (IAB) in the Hindi language; fMRI was performed using a standardized Hindi language paradigm (lexical, semantic, syntactic and comprehension components) in both cases and controls, before and after an anterior temporal lobectomy (in cases) with a 1.5T MR Scanner. An array of performance tests of intelligence and the verbal adult intelligence scale (VAIS) were used to measure the Intelligence Quotient (IQ) in Left TLE (LTLE) patients before and after surgery. Language laterality was estimated using the laterality index (LI-toolbox-spm8). Cohen's d test was performed to determine the effect sizes of the differences in the IAB scores, and Pearson's correlation was applied between regional (IFG and STG) activation in controls and TLE patients with more than 12 years of schooling [higher educational status (HES subgroup)] and those with less than 12 years of schooling [lower educational status (LES subgroup)].\nAt the baseline, clinical testing with IAB showed better scores in controls than in cases. Better scores were observed in subjects with higher levels of education than in those with lower levels of education. An improvement was observed in IQ scores in both the HES and LES groups after ATLR; significant worsening in the abstract ability subtest was noted in the LES group, whereas in the HES group there was an improvement. Blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) activation during language tasks was observed in both cerebral hemispheres in the TLE cases, while it was observed in the traditional left hemispheric language areas in controls. Postoperatively, greater BOLD activation was observed in the left inferior frontal gyri (IFG, r=0.65*; p<0.05), middle frontal gyrus (MFG, r=0.77**; p<0.01) superior temporal gyri (STG, r=0.88* p<0.02) and angular gyrus (AG, r=0.73*; p<0.04) in HES compared to LES subjects. Similarly, LI showed left lateralization of the frontal (LIw=0.77 & 0.71) and temporal (LIw=0.74 & 0.5) regions in controls and the TLE group (post-surgery) compared to the pre-surgery group during language tasks.\nGreater improvement in language skills and BOLD activation in the left hemisphere in TLE-patients (after epilepsy surgery) with a high level of education was similar to that of healthy controls, implying that education has an effect on the functional reorganization/recovery of language areas.", "The present study compares the 'bandwidth of cognition' between crows and primates. Working memory is the ability to maintain and manipulate information over short periods of time - a core component of cognition. The capacity of working memory is tightly limited, in humans correlated with individual intelligence and commonly used synonymously with cognitive capacity. Crows have remarkable cognitive skills and while birds and mammals share neural principles of working memory, its capacity has not been tested in crows. Here we report the performance of two carrion crows on a working memory paradigm adapted from a recent experiment in rhesus monkeys. Capacity of crows is remarkably similar to monkeys and estimated at about four items. In both species, the visual hemifields show largely independent capacity. These results show that crows, like primates evolved a high-capacity working memory that reflects the result of convergent evolution of higher cognitive abilities in both species.", "Methyl-CpG-binding domain 5 (MBD5)-associated neurodevelopmental disorder caused by 2q23.1 or MBD5-specific mutation has been recently identified as a genetic disorder associated with autism spectrum disorders. Phenotypic features of 2q23.1 deletion or disruption of MBD5 gene include severe intellectual disability, seizure, significant speech impairment, sleep disturbance, and autistic-like behavioural problems. Here we report a 7-year-old girl with intellectual disability and epilepsy without previous clinical diagnosis. Diagnostic exome sequencing identified a novel frameshift mutation c.254_255delGA (p.Arg85Asnfs*6) in the MBD5 gene of the proband and her father. The proband's father with normal intelligence showed subclinical manifestations observed in subsequent investigations. Clinical manifestations, disease course, and molecular findings of the involvement of MBD5 gene in this family suggest an unusual MBD5-related neurodevelopmental disorder. Moreover, this report demonstrates the critical role of next-generation sequencing technique in characterizing such a rare disorder with variable or no clinical manifestation and providing opportunity to develop effective preventive measures such as pre-implantation genetic diagnosis.", "Cerebralcare Granule\u00ae (CG), a Chinese herbal medicine, has been used to ameliorate cognitive impairment induced by ischemia or mental disorders. The ability of CG to improve health status and cognitive function has drawn researchers' attention, but the relevant brain circuits that underlie the ameliorative effects of CG remain unclear. The present study aimed to explore the underlying neurobiological mechanisms of CG in ameliorating cognitive function in sub-healthy subjects using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Thirty sub-healthy participants were instructed to take one 2.5-g package of CG three times a day for 3 months. Clinical cognitive functions were assessed with the Chinese Revised Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS-RC) and Wechsler Memory Scale (WMS), and fMRI scans were performed at baseline and the end of intervention. Functional brain network data were analyzed by conventional network metrics (CNM) and frequent subgraph mining (FSM). Then 21 other sub-healthy participants were enrolled as a blank control group of cognitive functional. We found that administrating CG can improve the full scale of intelligence quotient (FIQ) and Memory Quotient (MQ) scores. At the same time, following CG treatment, in CG group, the topological properties of functional brain networks were altered in various frontal, temporal, occipital cortex regions, and several subcortical brain regions, including essential components of the executive attention network, the salience network, and the sensory-motor network. The nodes involved in the FSM results were largely consistent with the CNM findings, and the changes in nodal metrics correlated with improved cognitive function. These findings indicate that CG can improve sub-healthy subjects' cognitive function through altering brain functional networks. These results provide a foundation for future studies of the potential physiological mechanism of CG.", "The relationship between blood alcohol level (BAL) and mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) remains in need of improved characterization. Adult patients suffering mTBI without intracranial pathology on computed tomography (CT) from the prospective Transforming Research and Clinical Knowledge in Traumatic Brain Injury Pilot study with emergency department (ED) Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) 13-15 and recorded blood alcohol level (BAL) were extracted. BAL\u226580-mg/dl was set as proxy for excessive use. Multivariable regression was performed for patients with six-month Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (GOSE; functional recovery) and Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale Processing Speed Index Composite Score (WAIS-PSI; nonverbal processing speed), using BAL\u226580-mg/dl and <80-mg/dl cohorts, adjusting for demographic/injury factors. Overall, 107 patients were aged 42.7\u00b116.8-years, 67.3%-male, and 80.4%-Caucasian; 65.4% had BAL=0-mg/dl, 4.6% BAL<80-mg/dl, and 30.0% BAL\u226580-mg/dl (range 100-440-mg/dl). BAL differed across loss of consciousness (LOC; none: median 0-mg/dl [interquartile range (IQR) 0-0], <30-min: 0-mg/dl [0-43], \u226530-min: 224-mg/dl [50-269], unknown: 108-mg/dl [0-232]; p=0.002). GCS<15 associated with higher BAL (19-mg/dl [0-204] vs. 0-mg/dl [0-20]; p=0.013). On univariate analysis, BAL\u226580-mg/dl associated with less-than-full functional recovery (GOSE\u22647; 38.1% vs. 11.5%; p=0.025) and lower WAIS-PSI (92.4\u00b112.7, 30th-percentile vs. 105.1\u00b111.7, 63rd-percentile; p<0.001). On multivariable regression BAL\u226580-mg/dl demonstrated an odds ratio of 8.05 (95% CI [1.35-47.92]; p=0.022) for GOSE\u22647 and an adjusted mean decrease of 8.88-points (95% CI [0.67-17.09]; p=0.035) on WAIS-PSI. Day-of-injury BAL>80-mg/dl after uncomplicated mTBI was associated with decreased GCS score and prolongation of reported LOC. BAL may be a biomarker for impaired return to baseline function and decreased nonverbal processing speed at six-months postinjury. Future confirmatory studies are needed.", "The Cattell-Horn-Carroll theory is the principal model at present to define and assess intelligence. However, several authors have suggested that the structure of intelligence is not stable throughout life. For example, children tend to present a general ability, which is invested in the development of specific and differentiated abilities during adolescence, reflecting the effect of schooling, experiences, and interests. In this study, an intelligence nine subtests battery was applied to a sample of 470 5-, 7-, and 9-year-old Portuguese children, from public and private basic schools. Two structure models have been tested, one assuming a global general factor loading by the nine subtests, and a second one formed by two factors integrating the verbal and non-verbal subtests. The results provide evidence of better fit of the second model where intelligence performance is organized in traditional verbal and non-verbal factors. This structure model is confirmed taking 5-, 7-, and 9-year-old children subgroups. A posterior path analysis verifies the impact of socio-familial variables in both factors. More than parents' educational levels and professional status, the results suggest the sibship size appears as more relevant on explanation of children cognitive performance.", "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) represents a very large set of neurodevelopmental issues with diverse clinical outcomes. Various hypotheses have been put forth for the etiology of autism spectrum disorder, including issues pertaining to oxidative stress. In this study, we conducted measurements of serum 8-Iso-Prostaglanding F2 \u03b1 (8-iso-PGF2\u03b1, which is the results of non-enzimatically mediated polyunsaturated fatty acid oxidation) in a population of individuals with autism and a control group of age and sex matched controls. A quantitative assay of Paraoxonase 1 (PON1) was conducted. Data regarding comorbidities, structural MRI scans, medication, intelligence quotient (IQ) and Childhood Autism Rating Scale scores (CARS) were also included in our study. Our results show that patients diagnosed with autism have higher levels of 8-iso-PGF2\u03b1 than their neurotypical counterparts. Levels of this particular metabolite, however, do not correlate with quantitative serum levels of Paraoxonase 1, which has been shown to be altered in individuals with autism. Neither 8-iso-PGF2\u03b1 nor quantitative levels of PON1 provide any meaningful correlation with clinical or neuroimaging data in this study group. Future research should focus on providing data regarding PON 1 phenotype, in addition to standard quantitative measurements, in relation to 8-iso-PGF2\u03b1 as well as other clinical and structural brain findings.", "In an associative patterning task, some people seem to focus more on learning an overarching rule, whereas others seem to focus on acquiring specific relations between the stimuli and outcomes involved. Building on earlier work, we further investigated which cognitive factors are involved in feature- vs. rule-based learning and generalization. To this end, we measured participants' tendency to generalize according to the rule of opposites after training on negative and positive patterning problems (i.e., A+/B+/AB- and C-/D-/CD+), their tendency to attend to global aspects or local details of stimuli, their systemizing disposition and their score on the Raven intelligence test. Our results suggest that while intelligence might have some influence on patterning learning and generalization, visual processing style and systemizing disposition do not. We discuss our findings in the light of previous observations on patterning.", "This study investigated the relationship of emotional intelligence and age to adolescents' (11-17 years) free labelling responses to proposed facial expressions and situations for disgust. Emotional intelligence continues to develop throughout adolescence and may provide needed cognitive support for linking the disgust face to the disgust script. Emotional intelligence, specifically, regulating one's own and others emotions, and age predicted adolescents' labelling of disgust facial expressions (but not situations) as disgusted. Older adolescents (15-17 years) were more likely to label disgust faces as disgusted than were younger adolescents (11-14 years) - an effect not found for disgust situations. Labelling the disgust face as disgusted continues to increase until late adolescence. The addition of the disgust face to the disgust script occurs in late adolescence and it is related to the cognitive abilities associated with emotional intelligence.", "Self-propelled micro- and nanoscale robots represent a rapidly emerging and fascinating robotics research area. However, designing autonomous and adaptive control systems for operating micro/nanorobotics in complex and dynamically changing environments, which is a highly demanding feature, is still an unmet challenge. Here we describe a smart microvehicle for precise autonomous navigation in complicated environments and traffic scenarios. The fully autonomous navigation system of the smart microvehicle is composed of a microscope-coupled CCD camera, an artificial intelligence planner, and a magnetic field generator. The microscope-coupled CCD camera provides real-time localization of the chemically powered Janus microsphere vehicle and environmental detection for path planning to generate optimal collision-free routes, while the moving direction of the microrobot toward a reference position is determined by the external electromagnetic torque. Real-time object detection offers adaptive path planning in response to dynamically changing environments. We demonstrate that the autonomous navigation system can guide the vehicle movement in complex patterns, in the presence of dynamically changing obstacles, and in complex biological environments. Such a navigation system for micro/nanoscale vehicles, relying on vision-based close-loop control and path planning, is highly promising for their autonomous operation in complex dynamic settings and unpredictable scenarios expected in a variety of realistic nanoscale scenarios.", "It is now well appreciated that benign epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (BECTS, or more recently, ECTS) is associated with a range of cognitive and behavioral disturbances. Despite our improved understanding of cognitive functioning in ECTS, there have been to date no efforts to quantitatively synthesize the available literature within a comprehensive cognitive framework.\nThe present systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted according to PRISMA guidelines. Forty-two case-control samples met eligibility criteria comprising a total of 1,237 children with ECTS and 1,137 healthy control children. Univariate, random-effects meta-analyses were conducted on eight cognitive factors in accordance with the Cattell-Horn-Carroll model of intelligence.\nOverall, children with ECTS demonstrated significantly lower scores on neuropsychological tests across all cognitive factors compared to healthy controls. Observed effects ranged from 0.42 to 0.81 pooled standard deviation units, with the largest effect for long-term storage and retrieval and the smallest effect for visual processing.\nThe results of the present meta-analysis provide the first clear evidence that children with ECTS display a profile of pervasive cognitive difficulties and thus challenge current conceptions of ECTS as a benign disease or of limited specific or localized cognitive effect.", "Distinct cognitive deficits have been described in Bipolar disorder (BD), including executive impairments, commonly attributed to frontal dysfunction. However, recent attention has been paid to the heterogeneity of cognitive functioning in this population, suggesting that the executive deficits observed in BD might be due to a loss in fluid intelligence (g). Following our previous line of investigation in multiple neurological and psychiatric conditions we aimed at determining the role of g in frontal deficits in BD. Euthymic BD patients (n = 51) and healthy controls (n = 37) were assessed with Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST), Verbal Fluency, Trail Making Test B (TMTB), a multitasking test, and a theory of mind test. A general cognitive battery was used to derive a measure of g. As in other neuropsychiatric conditions, significant patient-control differences in WCST, Verbal Fluency and TMTB were removed when g was introduced as a covariate. Deficits remained significant in the multitasking test. We suggest that neuropsychological assessment in BD should include tests of general intelligence, together with one or more specific tasks that allow for the assessment of residual frontal deficits, putatively associated with anterior frontal functioning.", "Desktop Genetics is a bioinformatics company building a gene-editing platform for personalized medicine. The company works with scientists around the world to design and execute state-of-the-art clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) experiments. Desktop Genetics feeds the lessons learned about experimental intent, single-guide RNA design and data from international genomics projects into a novel CRISPR artificial intelligence system. We believe that machine learning techniques can transform this information into a cognitive therapeutic development tool that will revolutionize medicine.", "Conditional reasoning (if p then q) is used very frequently in everyday situations. Conditional reasoning is impaired in brain-lesion patients, psychopathy, alcoholism, and polydrug dependence. Many neurocognitive deficits have also been described in schizophrenia. We assessed conditional reasoning in 25 patients with schizophrenia, 25 depressive patients, and 25 controls, using the Wason selection task in three different domains: social contracts, precautionary rules, and descriptive rules. Control measures included depression, anxiety, and severity of schizophrenia measures as a Verbal Intelligence Scale. Patients with schizophrenia were significantly impaired on all conditional reasoning tasks compared to depressives and controls. However, the social contract and precautions tasks yielded better results than the descriptive tasks. Differences between groups disappeared for social contract but remained for precautions and descriptive tasks when verbal intelligence was used as a covariate. These results suggest that domain-specific reasoning mechanisms, proposed by evolutionary psychologists, are relatively resilient in the face of brain network disruptions that impair more general reasoning abilities. Nevertheless, patients with schizophrenia could encounter difficulties understanding precaution rules and social contracts in real-life situations resulting in unwise risk-taking and misunderstandings in the social world.", "Emotional intelligence (EI) is a critical skill for occupational therapy, physiotherapy, and speech pathology students (therapy students). This article reports the findings from an analysis of interviews with therapy students (n\u00a0=\u00a024) to determine the aspects of clinical placements that therapy students perceived as influencing the changes in EI scores. This article reports the findings of the qualitative phase of a longitudinal, retrospective mixed methods design. Interviewees were selected using purposive sampling. Of those interviewed, 95% agreed that clinical placements had a significant impact on a range of EI skills with changes being both positive and negative. Content analysis showed that students perceived their EI skills had changed because of the following aspects of clinical placements: student-supervisor interactions, student interactions with patients in emotional distress and being encouraged to reflect and hear feedback on their EI skills. To support and enhance student's EI skills, interprofessional facilitators and profession-specific supervisors are recommended to utilise the following strategies with interprofessional cohorts. Supervisors and facilitators should be emotionally in-tune with students and trust students to work autonomously with patients experiencing emotional distress, pain and loss, especially those with complex needs. Importantly, interprofessional facilitators and direct supervisors should encourage students to reflect on their EI skills both individually and as a group. Supervisors should frequently evaluate and provide feedback to students on their EI skills, at the same time as providing feedback on their practical and clinical reasoning skills.", "Recent studies indicate that school-age children's patterns of performance on measures of verbal and visuospatial short-term memory (STM) and working memory (WM) differ across types of neurodevelopmental disorders. Because these disorders are often characterized by early language delay, administering STM and WM tests to toddlers could improve prediction of neurodevelopmental outcomes. Toddler-appropriate verbal, but not visuospatial, STM and WM tasks are available. A toddler-appropriate visuospatial STM test is introduced.\nTests of verbal STM, visuospatial STM, expressive vocabulary, and receptive vocabulary were administered to 92 English-speaking children aged 2-5 years.\nMean test scores did not differ for boys and girls. Visuospatial and verbal STM scores were not significantly correlated when age was partialed out. Age, visuospatial STM scores, and verbal STM scores accounted for unique variance in expressive (51%, 3%, and 4%, respectively) and receptive vocabulary scores (53%, 5%, and 2%, respectively) in multiple regression analyses.\nReplication studies, a fuller test battery comprising visuospatial and verbal STM and WM tests, and a general intelligence test are required before exploring the usefulness of these STM tests for predicting longitudinal outcomes. The lack of an association between the STM tests suggests that the instruments have face validity and test independent STM skills.", "Predicting glucose values on the basis of insulin and food intakes is a difficult task that people with diabetes need to do daily. This is necessary as it is important to maintain glucose levels at appropriate values to avoid not only short-term, but also long-term complications of the illness. Artificial intelligence in general and machine learning techniques in particular have already lead to promising results in modeling and predicting glucose concentrations. In this work, several machine learning techniques are used for the modeling and prediction of glucose concentrations using as inputs the values measured by a continuous monitoring glucose system as well as also previous and estimated future carbohydrate intakes and insulin injections. In particular, we use the following four techniques: genetic programming, random forests, k-nearest neighbors, and grammatical evolution. We propose two new enhanced modeling algorithms for glucose prediction, namely (i) a variant of grammatical evolution which uses an optimized grammar, and (ii) a variant of tree-based genetic programming which uses a three-compartment model for carbohydrate and insulin dynamics. The predictors were trained and tested using data of ten patients from a public hospital in Spain. We analyze our experimental results using the Clarke error grid metric and see that 90% of the forecasts are correct (i.e., Clarke error categories A and B), but still even the best methods produce 5 to 10% of serious errors (category D) and approximately 0.5% of very serious errors (category E). We also propose an enhanced genetic programming algorithm that incorporates a three-compartment model into symbolic regression models to create smoothed time series of the original carbohydrate and insulin time series.", "This study tests the validity of Beck's cognitive theory and Nolen-Hoeksema's response style theory of depression in adolescents with and without MBID.\nThe relationship between negative cognitive errors (Beck), response styles (Nolen-Hoeksema) and depressive symptoms was examined in 135 adolescents using linear regression.\nThe cognitive error 'underestimation of the ability to cope' was more prevalent among adolescents with MBID than among adolescents with average intelligence. This was the only negative cognitive error that predicted depressive symptoms. There were no differences between groups in the prevalence of the three response styles. In line with the theory, ruminating was positively and problem-solving was negatively related to depressive symptoms. Distractive response styles were not related to depressive symptoms. The relationship between response styles, cognitive errors and depressive symptoms were similar for both groups.\nThe main premises of both theories of depression are equally applicable to adolescents with and without MBID. The cognitive error 'Underestimation of the ability to cope' poses a specific risk factor for developing a depression for adolescents with MBID and requires special attention in treatment and prevention of depression. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS?: Despite the high prevalence of depression among adolescents with MBID, little is known about the etiology and cognitive processes that play a role in the development of depression in this group. The current paper fills this gap in research by examining the core tenets of two important theories on the etiology of depression (Beck's cognitive theory and Nolen-Hoeksema's response style theory) in a clinical sample of adolescents with and without MBID. This paper demonstrated that the theories are equally applicable to adolescents with MBID, as to adolescents with average intellectual ability. However, the cognitive bias 'underestimation of the ability to cope' was the only cognitive error related to depressive symptoms, and was much more prevalent among adolescents with MBID than among adolescents with average intellectual ability. This suggests that underestimating one's coping skills may be a unique risk factor for depression among adolescents with MBID. This knowledge is important in understanding the causes and perpetuating mechanisms of depression in adolescents with MBID, and for the development of prevention- and treatment programs for adolescents with MBID.", "The Woodcock-Johnson (fourth edition; WJ IV; Schrank, McGrew, & Mather, 2014a) was recently redeveloped and retains its linkage to Cattell-Horn-Carroll theory (CHC). Independent reviews (e.g., Canivez, 2017) and investigations (Dombrowski, McGill, & Canivez, 2017) of the structure of the WJ IV full test battery and WJ IV Cognitive have suggested the need for additional factor analytic exploration. Accordingly, the present study used principal axis factoring (PAF) followed by the Schmid and Leiman (SL; Schmid & Leiman, 1957) procedure with the 2 school-aged correlation matrices from the normative sample to determine the degree to which the WJ IV total battery structure could be replicated. Although 7 factors emerged across the 9 to 19 age range, the pattern of subtests loadings did not fully cohere with the structure presented in the Technical Manual, most notably for the academic fluency subtests. Also, the Fluid Reasoning (Gf) and Quantitative Reasoning (Gq) subtests coalesced to form a combined factor rather than 2 separate factors and the Long Term Retrieval (Gltr) subtests aligned with a variety of different factors. The results of this study indicated that the general intelligence factor variance far exceeded the variance attributed to the lower-order CHC factors. The combination of subtest migration and nominal total/common variance of the CHC lower-order factors suggests caution when interpreting the myriad CHC-related indices when making high stakes decisions. Implications for clinical practice are discussed.

Although this impairment is central to their social malfunctioning, its structural neural correlates remain unclear. To investigate this issue, we assessed Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test, revised version (Eyes Test) and acquired structural magnetic resonance images in adults with high-functioning ASD (n = 19) and age-, sex- and intelligence quotient-matched typically developing (TD) controls (n = 19). On the behavioral level, the Eyes Test scores were lower in the ASD group than in the control group. On the neural level, an interaction between group and Eyes Test score was found in the left temporoparietal junction (TPJ). A positive association between the Eyes Test score and gray matter volume of this region was evident in the control group, but not in the ASD group. This finding suggests that the failure to develop appropriate structural neural representations in the TPJ may underlie the impaired ability of individuals with ASD to read the mind in the eyes. These behavioral and neural findings provide support for the theories that impairments in processing eyes and the ability to infer others' mental states are the core symptoms of ASD, and that atypical features in the social brain network underlie such impairments.", "This report summarizes the first study (to the best of our knowledge) of the association between emotional intelligence (EI) and physical activity (PA) levels in a sample of generally healthy adults.\nAn online snowball sample of 110 generally healthy adults took part in this study and filled out measures of EI, PA, and background variables.\nAnalysis of structural equating modeling supported a path of positive association between EI and PA ranging from .20 to .28, controlling for background variables associated with PA. Of these, only education showed significant associations with PA.\nEI may play a role in individuals' PA patterns. Potential underlying mechanisms and directions for future research are suggested.", "Children born prematurely often have worse cognitive performance than those born at term regarding skills such as memory, attention and processing speed. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia may compromise cognitive development. The aims here were: a) To describe the cognitive performance of preterm infants with very low birth weight; b) To investigate its association with bronchopul-monary dysplasia adjusted for sociodemographic, neonatal and post-neonatal factors.\nCross-sectional study developed in a public tertiary-care hospital.\nTo evaluate cognition among 112 children, we applied an intelligence scale (Wechsler scale). The average scores for children with and without bronchopulmonary dysplasia were compared across the fve domains of the scale. Associations with bronchopulmonary dysplasia were investigated for domains that showed signifcant diferences between the two groups. Associations between exposure and outcome were estimated via multivariate logistic regression.\nThere were no diferences in averages for the full-scale intelligence quotient, verbal intelligence quotient, performance intelligence quotient and general language composite domains. The processing speed quotient was the only domain that presented a signifcant diference between the two groups (P = 0.02). Among the children with bronchopulmonary dysplasia, low full-scale intelligence quotient was observed in 28.1%. In the multivariate analysis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (odds ratio: 3.1; 95conf-dence interval: 1.1-8.7) remained associated with the outcome of processing speed quotient.\nBronchopulmonary dysplasia was an independent risk factor for alteration of the processing speed quotient.\nCrian\u00e7as nascidas prematuras com frequ\u00eancia apresentam pior desempenho cognitivo que as nascidas a termo em habilidades como mem\u00f3ria, aten\u00e7\u00e3o, velocidade de processamento.

In addition, the note writing applications in currently available electronic health records (EHRs) do not function to support decision making to any substantial degree. We suggest that artificial intelligence (AI) could be utilized to facilitate the workflows of the data collection and assembly processes, as well as to support the development of personalized, yet data-driven assessments and plans.", "This article investigates whether the United States' counterinsurgency operations have inhibited polio eradication efforts in northwestern Pakistan, the world's last major reservoir of polio. Anecdotal evidence suggests that militants disrupt polio vaccination programs because of suspicions that campaigns are a cover for gathering intelligence on Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) drone targets. This paper analyzes national-level quantitative data to test this argument. Between 2004 and 2012, the number of polio cases in Pakistan closely mirrored the number of drone strikes. But from 2013 onward, polio cases increased while drone strikes fell. This can be explained by the CIA's use of a fake immunization campaign in a failed attempt to obtain the DNA of Osama bin Laden's relatives prior to his assassination in 2011. This seemingly vindicated militants' suspicions that vaccination programs were a cover for espionage. Militants consequently intensified their disruption of immunization campaigns, resulting in an increase in polio cases in Pakistan, as well as in Afghanistan, Syria, and Iraq. For politicians and military planners, drones are attractive because they are said to harm fewer civilians than conventional methods of warfare. However, this paper demonstrates that drone strikes had negative effects on the well-being of civilians in Pakistan and further afield because they undermined global efforts to eradicate polio.", "A continuing debate in studies of social development in both humans and other animals is the extent to which early life experiences affect adult behavior. Also unclear are the relative contributions of cognitive skills (\"intelligence\") and temperament for successful outcomes. Guide dogs are particularly suited to research on these questions. To succeed as a guide dog, individuals must accomplish complex navigation and decision making without succumbing to distractions and unforeseen obstacles. Faced with these rigorous demands, only \u223c70% of dogs that enter training ultimately achieve success. What predicts success as a guide dog? To address these questions, we followed 98 puppies from birth to adulthood. We found that high levels of overall maternal behavior were linked with a higher likelihood of program failure. Furthermore, mothers whose nursing style required greater effort by puppies were more likely to produce successful offspring, whereas mothers whose nursing style required less effort were more likely to produce offspring that failed. In young adults, an inability to solve a multistep task quickly, compounded with high levels of perseveration during the task, was associated with failure. Young adults that were released from the program also appeared more anxious, as indicated by a short latency to vocalize when faced with a novel object task. Our results suggest that both maternal nursing behavior and individual traits of cognition and temperament are associated with guide dog success.", "Baddeley's grammatical reasoning test is a quick and efficient measure of fluid reasoning which is commonly used in research on cognitive abilities and the impact of stresses and environmental factors on cognitive performance. The test, however, is verbal and can only be used with native speakers of English. In this study, we adapted the test for application in the Persian language using a different pair of verbs and geometrical shapes instead of English letters. The adapted test had high internal consistency and retest reliability estimates. It also had an excellent fit to a one-factor confirmatory factor model and correlated acceptably with other measures of fluid intelligence and participants' grade point average (GPA).", "Intelligent sensing is drastically changing our everyday life including healthcare by biomedical signal monitoring, collection, and analytics. However, long-term healthcare monitoring generates tremendous data volume and demands significant wireless transmission power, which imposes a big challenge for wearable healthcare sensors usually powered by batteries. Efficient compression engine design to reduce wireless transmission data rate with ultra-low power consumption is essential for wearable miniaturized healthcare sensor systems. This paper presents an ultra-low power biomedical signal compression engine for healthcare data sensing and analytics in the era of big data and sensor intelligence. It extracts the feature points of the biomedical signal by window-based turning angle detection. The proposed approach has low complexity and thus low power consumption while achieving a large compression ratio (CR) and good quality of reconstructed signal. Near-threshold design technique is adopted to further reduce the power consumption on the circuit level. Besides, the angle threshold for compression can be adaptively tuned according to the error between the original signal and reconstructed signal to address the variation of signal characteristics from person to person or from channel to channel to meet the required signal quality with optimal CR. For demonstration, the proposed biomedical compression engine has been used and evaluated for ECG compression. It achieves an average (CR) of 71.08% and percentage root-mean-square difference (PRD) of 5.87% while consuming only 39 nW. Compared to several state-of-the-art ECG compression engines, the proposed design has significantly lower power consumption while achieving similar CRD and PRD, making it suitable for long-term wearable miniaturized sensor systems to sense and collect healthcare data for remote data analytics.", "The integration of digital technology into everyday lives of young people has become widespread. It is not known whether and how technology influences barriers and facilitators to healthcare, and whether and how young people navigate between face-to-face and virtual healthcare. To provide new knowledge essential to policy and practice, we designed a study that would explore health system access and navigation in the digital age. The study objectives are to: (1) describe experiences of young people accessing and navigating the health system in New South Wales (NSW), Australia; (2) identify barriers and facilitators to healthcare for young people and how these vary between groups; (3) describe health system inefficiencies, particularly for young people who are marginalised; (4) provide policy-relevant knowledge translation of the research data.\nThis mixed methods study has four parts, including: (1) a cross-sectional survey of young people (12-24 years) residing in NSW, Australia; (2) a longitudinal, qualitative study of a subsample of marginalised young people (defined as young people who: identify as Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander; are experiencing homelessness; identify as sexuality and/or gender diverse; are of refugee or vulnerable migrant background; and/or live in rural or remote NSW); (3) interviews with professionals; (4) a knowledge translation forum.\nEthics approvals were sought and granted. Data collection commenced in March 2016 and will continue until June 2017. This study will gather practice and policy-relevant intelligence about contemporary experiences of young people and health services, with a unique focus on five different groups of marginalised young people, documenting their experiences over time. Access 3 will explore navigation around all levels of the health system, determine whether digital technology is integrated into this, and if so how, and will translate findings into policy-relevant recommendations.", "The current study investigated the relationships between empathy (emotional and cognitive), emotional intelligence, psychopathy, emotional contagion, and non-conscious behavioural mimicry (smiles and hand scratches), using self-report scales and a script-based interview session exhibiting nine non-verbal gestures, on a student sample. Past findings suggest a deficit of emotional but not cognitive empathy in psychopaths. Empirical research on non-conscious behavioural mimicry in psychopathy with reference to emotional intelligence is somewhat scarce; however it was proposed that individuals high in psychopathic traits would show reduced emotional mimicry based on the relation of empathy to mimicry. The study was quasi-experimental, involving individual assessment of 51 participants. Results suggest decreased emotional empathy at high levels of psychopathy and show that emotional intelligence moderates the relationship between psychopathy and non-conscious mimicry (smiles per minute). Social competence might be more predictive of effects of psychopathy on non-conscious mimicry.", "To assess the association of cognitive impairment and clinical symptoms in first-episode schizophrenia with the Val66Met (rs6265) polymorphism of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) gene.\nFor 87 patients with first-episode schizophrenia and 76 healthy controls, the Val66Met polymorphism was determined with a Taqman Assay-on-Demand method. Wechsler intelligence test was carried out for all participants. Correlation of cognitive impairment with clinical severity was also analyzed.\nThe patients were significantly lower in total IQ, verbal IQ and performance IQ compared to the controls. The lower total IQ (F=4.59, P= 0.01) and verbal IQ (F=4.44, P=0.01) were influenced by genetic factors and diagnostic interaction. The vertal IQ of Val/Val patients was significantly lower than those of Val/Met and Met/Met carriers. For the control group, the verbal IQ of Met/Met carriers was lower than that of Val/Met carriers, and the total IQ of Met/Met carriers was lower than those of Val/Met and Val/Val carriers. For the patient group, the total IQ of Val/Val carriers was negatively correlated with positive symptoms (r=-0.65, P=0.03) and thought disorders (r=-0.61, P=0.02).\nCognitive impairment in first-episode schizophrenic patients is associated with the Val66Met polymorphism of the BDNF gene, and has an important clinical relevance.", "To investigate the neurocognitive function of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and long-term disease-free survival and related influencing factors.\nA total of 40 ALL children with long-term disease-free survival were enrolled as study group, and 40 healthy children were enrolled as control group. The Chinese Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (C-WISC), continuous performance test (CPT), and Stroop test software were used for the evaluation of all children. Neurocognitive function was compared between groups and influencing factors were analyzed.\nCompared with the control group, the study group had significantly lower full intelligence quotient, verbal intelligence quotient, and performance intelligence quotient in C-WICS (P<0.05) and significantly higher numbers of mistakes and misses in CPT (P<0.05). There were no significant differences in the numbers of correct answers, mistakes, and misses of word-color consistency between the study group and the control group (P>0.05), while the study group had significantly higher numbers of mistakes and misses of word-color contradiction and irrelevance (P<0.05). The total dose of high-dose methotrexate and ALL risk classification were associated with the reduction in intelligence quotient, and children's younger age at diagnosis of ALL was associated with the higher numbers of misses and mistakes. Girls tended to have a significantly lower performance intelligence quotient than boys (P<0.05).\nALL children with long-term disease-free survival have neurocognitive impairment, which may be associated with the dose of chemotherapeutic drugs, age at diagnosis, and sex.\n\u63a2\u8ba8\u957f\u671f\u65e0\u75c5\u751f\u5b58\u6025\u6027\u6dcb\u5df4\u7ec6\u80de\u767d\u8840\u75c5\uff08ALL\uff09\u513f\u7ae5\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u8ba4\u77e5\u529f\u80fd\u53ca\u5f71\u54cd\u56e0\u7d20\u3002\n\u4ee540\u4f8b\u957f\u671f\u65e0\u75c5\u751f\u5b58ALL\u513f\u7ae5\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u8c61\uff0c40\u4f8b\u5065\u5eb7\u513f\u7ae5\u4e3a\u5bf9\u7167\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u4e2d\u56fd\u4fee\u8ba2\u97e6\u6c0f\u513f\u7ae5\u667a\u529b\u91cf\u8868\uff08C-WISC\uff09\u3001\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u64cd\u4f5c\u6d4b\u9a8c\uff08CPT\uff09\u53caStroop\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5bf9\u4e24\u7ec4\u513f\u7ae5\u8fdb\u884c\u6d4b\u8bc4\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e24\u7ec4\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u8ba4\u77e5\u529f\u80fd\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u5176\u5f71\u54cd\u56e0\u7d20\u3002\n\u957f\u671f\u65e0\u75c5\u751f\u5b58ALL\u513f\u7ae5C-WICS\u6d4b\u9a8c\u7684\u603b\u667a\u5546\uff08FIQ\uff09\u3001\u8a00\u8bed\u667a\u5546\uff08VIQ\uff09\u3001\u64cd\u4f5c\u667a\u5546\uff08PIQ\uff09\u5747\u4f4e\u4e8e\u5bf9\u7167\u7ec4\uff08P < 0.05\uff09\uff1bCPT\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u6570\u53ca\u6f0f\u7b54\u6570\u9ad8\u4e8e\u5bf9\u7167\u7ec4\uff08P < 0.05\uff09\uff1bStroop\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5b57\u8272\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u6570\u3001\u9519\u8bef\u6570\u3001\u6f0f\u7b54\u6570\u4e0e\u5bf9\u7167\u7ec4\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u65e0\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u610f\u4e49\uff08P > 0.05\uff09\uff0c\u5b57\u8272\u77db\u76fe\u53ca\u5b57\u8272\u65e0\u5173\u9519\u8bef\u6570\u3001\u6f0f\u7b54\u6570\u9ad8\u4e8e\u5bf9\u7167\u7ec4\uff08P < 0.05\uff09\u3002\u5927\u5242\u91cf\u7532\u6c28\u558b\u5464\u7684\u603b\u5242\u91cf\u3001ALL\u5371\u9669\u5206\u7ea7\u4e0e\u667a\u5546\u964d\u4f4e\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u521d\u8bca\u65f6\u5e74\u9f84\u4e0e\u6f0f\u7b54\u6570\u3001\u9519\u8bef\u6570\u5f97\u5206\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u5973\u6027\u64cd\u4f5c\u667a\u5546\u8f83\u4f4e\uff0c\u5dee\u5f02\u5747\u6709\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u610f\u4e49\uff08P < 0.05\uff09\u3002\n\u957f\u671f\u65e0\u75c5\u751f\u5b58ALL\u513f\u7ae5\u5b58\u5728\u795e\u7ecf\u8ba4\u77e5\u529f\u80fd\u635f\u5bb3\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0e\u5316\u7597\u836f\u7269\u5242\u91cf\u3001\u8bca\u65ad\u65f6\u7684\u5e74\u9f84\u3001\u6027\u522b\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "Pregnancy after transplantation is associated with high risk of complications and prenatal exposure to immunosuppressants. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the intellectual development of children born to women after organ transplantation.\nA comparison of intelligence levels in 78 children of kidney or liver transplant women of 78 children born to healthy mothers. The assessment of intellectual level in children was conducted by psychologists and evaluated using age-adjusted intelligence tests (Psyche Cattell Infant Intelligence Scale, Terman-Merril Intelligence Scale or the Scales of Raven's Progressive Matrices).\nNo significant differences in the distribution of the quotient of intelligence between children born to kidney and liver transplant women were noted (Chi2\u2009=\u20095.037; p\u2009=\u2009.284). Also no differences in the distribution of intelligence levels were noted between the children of transplanted and healthy mothers in infants and toddlers (Chi2\u2009=\u20093.125; p\u2009=\u2009.537); preschool (Chi2\u2009=\u20091.440; p\u2009=\u2009.692), and school age children (Chi2\u2009=\u20094.079; p\u2009=\u2009.395).\nThe intellectual development of children of post-transplant women is similar to the general population. These results provide information on the low risk of intellectual disability in children of transplanted mothers and may improve counseling on the planning of pregnancy in this group of women.", "This study tested a parallel two-mediator model in which the relationship between dimensions of emotional intelligence and online gaming addiction are mediated by perceived helplessness and perceived self-efficacy, respectively. The sample included 931 male adolescents (mean age = 16.18 years, SD = 0.95) from southern China. Data on emotional intelligence (four dimensions, including self-management of emotion, social skills, empathy and utilization of emotions), perceived stress (two facets, including perceived self-efficacy and perceived helplessness) and online gaming addiction were collected, and bootstrap methods were used to test this parallel two-mediator model. Our findings revealed that perceived self-efficacy mediated the relationship between three dimensions of emotional intelligence (i.e., self-management, social skills, and empathy) and online gaming addiction, and perceived helplessness mediated the relationship between two dimensions of emotional intelligence (i.e., self-management and emotion utilization) and online gaming addiction. These findings underscore the importance of separating the four dimensions of emotional intelligence and two facets of perceived stress to understand the complex relationship between these factors and online gaming addiction.", "Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is a complex and heterogeneous neuropsychiatric syndrome. Contamination obsessions and washing/cleaning compulsions are the most frequent clinical OCD subtypes. The current study aimed at examining the neuropsychological impairments in drug-naive obsessive-compulsive (OC) washers without depressive symptoms and their association with the severity of symptoms.\nIn the current causal-comparative study, 35 patients with diagnostic and statistical mental disorders class (DSM)-IV diagnosed with washing-subtype OCD and 35 healthy subjects were selected by the convenience sampling method and evaluated by computerized neuropsychology battery and clinical tests as Stroop Color-Word Test (SCWT), Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST), Go/No-Go Test, Digits Forward (DF), Digits Backward (DB), Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), and General Health Questionnaire (GHQ)-28. The patients were matched to the comparison group with regard to age, gender, intelligence quotient (IQ), education, and handedness. All the tests were standardized in Iran. SPSS version 20.00 was used for descriptive and analytical data analysis.\nThere was no statistically significant different between the OCD washing and the control groups regarding socio-demographic variables or IQ. There were significant differences between the OC washer and the healthy control groups on the neuropsychological functioning. The obtained results suggested that OC washers performed significantly worse on neuropsychological measures than the controls. There was no significant association between the severity of OC symptoms and the neuropsychological functions in the OCD washing group.\nIt was concluded that executive function impairment, which is a core feature in OC washers was trait-like in nature.", "Clinicians are inveterate leaders. We lead patients through the difficult maze of illness, families through the travails of ill loved ones, and physicians-in-training through the gauntlet of learning medicine. Yet, in the context of a range of leadership styles that effective leaders must be able to deploy situationally, physician leaders have traditionally defaulted to a \"command and control\" style that fosters the concept of physicians as \"Viking warriors\" or \"heroic lone healers.\" The perverse effects of \"command and control\" are that this style conspires against collaboration and tends to be perpetuated as aspiring leaders emulate their predecessors. Because healthcare faces challenges of cost, access, and quality and is in the throes of change, the current landscape requires effective leadership. Though still relatively uncommon among healthcare organizations, frontrunner organizations are offering leadership development programs. The design of such programs requires clarity about requisite leadership competencies and about how and when to best to deliver such curricula. As one example, the American Thoracic Society has launched its Emerging Leaders Program (ELP), which is currently offering a leadership development curriculum to 18 selected emerging leaders. The ATS ELP curriculum focuses on awareness of self and system and incorporates highly participatory sessions on emotional intelligence, teambuilding, change management, situational leadership, appreciative inquiry, process and quality improvement, strategic planning, and organizational culture. Short-term deliverables are the development and presentation of business plans for innovations proposed by the group. Hoped for longer-term outcomes include an enhanced leadership pipeline for global respiratory health.", "Golgi is one of the core proteins of a cell, constitutes in both plants and animals, which is involved in protein synthesis. Golgi is responsible for receiving and processing the macromolecules and trafficking of newly processed protein to its intended destination. Dysfunction in Golgi protein is expected to cause many neurodegenerative and inherited diseases that may be cured well if they are detected effectively and timely. Golgi protein is categorized into two parts cis-Golgi and trans-Golgi. The identification of Golgi protein via direct method is very hard due to limited available recognized structures. Therefore, the researchers divert their attention toward the sequences from structures. However, owing to technological advancement, exploration of huge amount of sequences was reported in the databases. So recognition of large amount of unprocessed data using conventional methods is very difficult. Therefore, the concept of intelligence was incorporated with computational model. Intelligence based computational model obtained reasonable results, but the gap of improvement is still under consideration. In this regard, an intelligent automatic recognition model is developed in order to enhance the true classification rate of sub-Golgi proteins. In this approach, discrete and evolutionary feature extraction methods are applied on the benchmark Golgi protein datasets to excerpt salient, propound and variant numerical descriptors. After that, an oversampling technique Syntactic Minority over Sampling Technique is employed to balance the data. Hybrid spaces are also generated with combination of these feature spaces. Further, Fisher feature selection method is utilized to reduce the extra noisy and redundant features from feature vector. Finally, k-nearest neighbor algorithm is used as learning hypothesis. Three distinct cross validation tests are used to examine the stability and efficiency of the proposed model. The predicted outcomes of proposed model are better than the existing models in the literature so far. Finally, it is anticipated that the proposed model will provide the foundation to pharmaceutical industry in drug design and research community to innovate new ideas in the area of computational biology and bioinformatics.", "As part of the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), measures of child IQ were collected by trained psychologists. The Wechsler Pre-school and Primary Scale of Intelligence - Revised UK edition (WPPSI) was used at age 4 years in a subsample of children enrolled in ALSPAC (the Children in Focus cohort), chosen at random from the last 6 months of ALSPAC births (about 10% of the participants). At age 8 years all children enrolled in the main cohort were invited to complete a short form of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC)-III UK. Prenatal blood lead (B-Pb) concentrations were measured by inductively-couple plasma mass spectrometry in samples from women at a median gestation age of 11 weeks. Child blood lead was measured by atomic absorption spectrometry in samples from children attending the Children in Focus clinic at age 30 months. Maternal reports at 32 weeks' gestation were used to generate data on a range of potential confounders. The data were used to determine the associations between prenatal exposure to lead and child IQ at 4 and 8 years. The effect of child B-Pb at 3 years as a moderator of these associations was tested.

Reaction time and accuracy in dual task conditions have an inverse relationship relative to single task, independently from sex. While a more disseminated network, parallel to decreasing accuracy and reaction time has been demonstrated in dual task fMRI studies, little is known so far whether there exist respective sex-related differences in activation.\nWe subjected 20 women (mean age = 25.45; SD = 5.23) and 20 men (mean age = 27.55; SD = 4.00) to a combined verbal and spatial fMRI paradigm at 3.0T to assess sex-related skills, based on the assumption that generally women better perform in verbal tasks while men do better in spatial tasks. We also obtained behavioral tests for verbal and spatial intelligence, attention, executive functions, and working memory.\nNo differences between women and men were observed in behavioral measures of dual-tasking or cognitive performance. Generally, brain activation increased with higher task load, mainly in the bilateral inferior and prefrontal gyri, the anterior cingulum, thalamus, putamen and occipital areas. Comparing sexes, women showed increased activation in the inferior frontal gyrus in the verbal dual-task while men demonstrated increased activation in the precuneus and adjacent visual areas in the spatial task.\nAgainst the background of equal cognitive and behavioral dual-task performance in both sexes, we provide first evidence for sex-related activation differences in functional networks for verbal and spatial dual-tasking.", "Reports an error in \"Functional architecture of visual emotion recognition ability: A latent variable approach\" by Gary J. Lewis, Carmen E. Lefevre and Andrew W. Young (Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, 2016[May], Vol 145[5], 589-602). In the article, there were several errors in Table 5. The correlations between the AQ-10 and both the supramodal and face-specific latent ability factors were set as positive. They should have been negative. The correct values are shown in the table provided. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2016-13445-001.) Emotion recognition has been a focus of considerable attention for several decades. However, despite this interest, the underlying structure of individual differences in emotion recognition ability has been largely overlooked and thus is poorly understood. For example, limited knowledge exists concerning whether recognition ability for one emotion (e.g., disgust) generalizes to other emotions (e.g., anger, fear). Furthermore, it is unclear whether emotion recognition ability generalizes across modalities, such that those who are good at recognizing emotions from the face, for example, are also good at identifying emotions from nonfacial cues (such as cues conveyed via the body). The primary goal of the current set of studies was to address these questions through establishing the structure of individual differences in visual emotion recognition ability. In three independent samples (Study 1: n = 640; Study 2: n = 389; Study 3: n = 303), we observed that the ability to recognize visually presented emotions is based on different sources of variation: a supramodal emotion-general factor, supramodal emotion-specific factors, and face- and within-modality emotion-specific factors. In addition, we found evidence that general intelligence and alexithymia were associated with supramodal emotion recognition ability. Autism-like traits, empathic concern, and alexithymia were independently associated with face-specific emotion recognition ability. These results (a) provide a platform for further individual differences research on emotion recognition ability, (b) indicate that differentiating levels within the architecture of emotion recognition ability is of high importance, and (c) show that the capacity to understand expressions of emotion in others is linked to broader affective and cognitive processes. (PsycINFO Database Record", "The current meta-analytic review evaluated the effects of experimentally manipulated sleep restriction on neurocognitive functioning. Random-effects models were employed to estimate the overall effect size and the differential effect size across cognitive domains. Age, time of day, age-adjusted sleep deficit, cumulative days of restricted sleep, sleep latency, subjective sleepiness, and biological sex were examined as potential moderators of the effect. Based on a sample of 61 studies, from 71 different populations, findings revealed a significant negative effect of sleep restriction on cognitive processing across cognitive domains (g=-0.383, p<0.001). This effect held for executive functioning (g=-0.324, p<0.001), sustained attention (g=-0.409, p<0.001), and long-term memory (g=-0.192, p=0.002). There was insufficient evidence to detect an effect within the domains of attention, multitask, impulsive decision-making or intelligence. Age group, time of day, cumulative days of restricted sleep, sleep latency, subjective sleepiness, and biological sex were all significant moderators of the overall effect. In conclusion, the current meta-analysis is the first comprehensive review to provide evidence that short-term sleep restriction significantly impairs waking neurocognitive functioning.", "It has recently been warned that children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) show a deficit in emotional competence and emotional intelligence, specifically in their ability to emotional recognition.\nA systematic review of the scientific literature in reference to the emotional recognition of facial expressions in children with ADHD is presented in order to establish or rule the existence of emotional deficits as primary dysfunction in this disorder and, where appropriate, the effect size of the differences against normal development or neurotypical children.\nThe results reveal the recent interest in the issue and the lack of information. Although there is no complete agreement, most of the studies show that emotional recognition of facial expressions is affected in children with ADHD, showing them significantly less accurate than children from control groups in recognizing emotions communicated through facial expressions. A part of these studies make comparisons on the recognition of different discrete emotions; having observed that children with ADHD tend to a greater difficulty recognizing negative emotions, especially anger, fear, and disgust.\nThese results have direct implications for the educational and clinical diagnosis of ADHD; and for the educational intervention for children with ADHD, emotional education might entail an advantageous aid.\nDificultades de reconocimiento emocional facial como deficit primario en ni\u00f1os con trastorno por deficit de atencion/hiperactividad: revision sistematica.\nIntroduccion. Recientemente se ha advertido que los ni\u00f1os con trastorno por deficit de atencion/hiperactividad (TDAH) muestran algun deficit en su competencia o inteligencia emocional, en concreto, en su capacidad de reconocimiento emocional. Pacientes y metodos. Se presenta una revision sistematica de la literatura cientifica referente al reconocimiento emocional de expresiones faciales en ni\u00f1os con TDAH con el objeto de establecer o descartar la existencia de deficits emocionales como disfunciones primarias en dicho trastorno y, en su caso, el tama\u00f1o del efecto de las diferencias con ni\u00f1os de desarrollo normal o neurotipico. Resultados. Los resultados desvelan lo reciente del interes sobre el asunto y la limitada informacion al respecto. A pesar de que no hay acuerdo total, la mayor parte de los estudios evidencia que el reconocimiento emocional de expresiones faciales esta afectado en los ni\u00f1os con TDAH, y estos se muestran significativamente menos precisos que ni\u00f1os pertenecientes a grupos control en el reconocimiento de emociones comunicadas a traves de expresiones faciales. Una parte de estos estudios realiza comparaciones en el reconocimiento de diferentes emociones discretas, y se observa en los ni\u00f1os con TDAH una tendencia a la mayor dificultad para el reconocimiento de emociones negativas, principalmente ira, miedo y asco. Conclusiones. Estos resultados tienen implicaciones directas para el diagnostico educativo y clinico del TDAH, y para la intervencion educativa con ni\u00f1os con TDAH, a quienes la educacion emocional podria suponerles una ventajosa ayuda.", "Recently developed triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) act as a promising power source for self-powered electronic devices. However, the majority of TENGs are fabricated using metallic electrodes and cannot achieve high stretchability and transparency, simultaneously. Here, slime-based ionic conductors are used as transparent current-collecting layers of TENG, thus significantly enhancing their energy generation, stretchability, transparency, and instilling self-healing characteristics. This is the first demonstration of using an ionic conductor as the current collector in a mechanical energy harvester. The resulting ionic-skin TENG (IS-TENG) has a transparency of 92% transmittance, and its energy-harvesting performance is 12 times higher than that of the silver-based electronic current collectors. In addition, they are capable of enduring a uniaxial strain up to 700%, giving the highest performance compared to all other transparent and stretchable mechanical-energy harvesters. Additionally, this is the first demonstration of an autonomously self-healing TENG that can recover its performance even after 300 times of complete bifurcation. The IS-TENG represents the first prototype of a highly deformable and transparent power source that is able to autonomously self-heal quickly and repeatedly at room temperature, and thus can be used as a power supply for digital watches, touch sensors, artificial intelligence, and biointegrated electronics.", "Early life BPA exposure could affect neurobehavior, but few studies have investigated whether there are developmental periods when the fetus or child is more vulnerable to these potential effects.\nWe explored windows of vulnerability to BPA exposure in a multiethnic cohort of 228 mothers and their children from Cincinnati, Ohio.\nWe measured urinary BPA concentrations at up to two prenatal and six postnatal time points from the 2nd trimester of pregnancy until the child was age 8years. At age 8years, we administered the Behavioral Assessment System for Children-2 (BASC-2), Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function, and Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-IV. We estimated covariate-adjusted differences in composite scores from each instrument using a multiple informant model designed to identify heightened windows of vulnerability.\nAmong all children, there was not strong evidence that the associations between BPA and neurobehavior varied by the timing of exposure (Visit x BPA p-values\u22650.16). However, child sex modified the associations of repeated BPA measures with BASC-2 scores (Visit x Sex x BPA p-values=0.02-0.23). For example, each 10-fold increase in prenatal BPA was associated with more externalizing behaviors in girls (\u03b2=6.2, 95% CI: 0.8, 11.6), but not boys (\u03b2=-0.8, 95% CI: -5.0, 3.4). In contrast, a 10-fold increase in 8-year BPA was associated with more externalizing behaviors in boys (\u03b2=3.9, 95% CI: 0.6, 7.2), but not girls (\u03b2=0.3, 95% CI: -3.5, 4.1).\nWe found that sex-dependent associations between BPA and child neurobehavior may depend on the timing of BPA exposure.", "While behavioural trials of working memory (WM) training have received much attention in recent years, a lesser explored parallel approach is functional neuroimaging. A small literature has suggested a complex time course for functional activation pattern changes following WM training (i.e. not simply increasing or decreasing due to training); however, no study to date has examined such neuroplastic effects in both the training task (dual n-back) and the fluid intelligence transfer task to which the training is purported to transfer (Raven's Matrices). This study investigated neural correlates of WM training in healthy young adults randomized to six weeks of WM training, or an active control condition (processing speed training) with a pre- and post-training fMRI design. Results indicated significant reductions in activation for the WM trained group in key WM-task related areas for trained WM tasks after training compared to the processing speed active control group. The same pattern of training related decreases in activation for the WM trained group was not observed for the transfer task, which is consistent with null results for all cognitive outcomes of the present trial. The observed pattern of results suggests that repetitive practice with a complex task does indeed lead to neuroplastic processes that very likely represent the reduced demand for attentional control while sub-components of the task become more routinized with practice. We suggest that future research investigate neural correlates of WM training in populations for which WM itself is impaired and/or behavioural trials of WM training have returned more promising results.", "To systematically examine published literature which assessed the prevalence of academic difficulties in children with epilepsy (CWE) of normal intelligence, and its associating factors.\nA search was conducted on five databases for articles published in English from 1980 till March 2015. Included were studies who recruited children (aged 5-18 years), with a diagnosis or newly/recurrent epilepsy, an intelligent quotient (IQ) of \u226570 or attending regular school, with or without a control group, which measured academic achievement using a standardised objective measure, and published in English. Excluded were children with learning difficulties, intellectual disabilities (IQ<70) and other comorbidities such as attention deficits hyperactive disorder or autism. Two pairs of reviewers extracted the data, and met to resolve any differences from the data extraction process.\nTwenty studies were included. The majority of the studies assessed \"low achievement\" whist only two studies used the IQ-achievement discrepancy definition of \"underachievement\". Fourteen studies (70%) reported that CWE had significantly lower academic achievement scores compared to healthy controls, children with asthma or reported norms. The remaining six studies (30%) did not report any differences. CWE had stable academic achievement scores over time (2-4 years), even among those whose seizure frequency improved. Higher parental education and children with higher IQ, and had better attention or had a positive attitude towards epilepsy, were associated with higher academic achievement score. Older children were found to have lower academic achievement score.\nIn CWE of normal intelligence, the majority of published literature found that academic achievement was lower than controls or reported norms. The high percentages of low achievement in CWE, especially in the older age group, and the stability of scores even as seizure frequency improved, highlights the need for early screening of learning problems, and continued surveillance.", "Maintenance of periodontal health or transition to a periodontal lesion reflects the continuous and ongoing battle between the vast microbial ecology in the oral cavity and the array of resident and emigrating inflammatory/immune cells in the periodontium. This war clearly signifies many 'battlefronts' representing the interface of the mucosal-surface cells with the dynamic biofilms composed of commensal and potential pathogenic species, as well as more recent knowledge demonstrating active invasion of cells and tissues of the periodontium leading to skirmishes in connective tissue, the locality of bone and even in the local vasculature. Research in the discipline has uncovered a concerted effort of the microbiome, using an array of survival strategies, to interact with other bacteria and host cells. These strategies aid in colonization by 'ambushing, infiltrating and outflanking' host cells and molecules, responding to local environmental changes (including booby traps for host biomolecules), communicating within and between genera and species that provide MASINT (Measurement and Signature Intelligence) to enhance sustained survival, sabotage the host inflammatory and immune responses and by potentially adopting a 'Fabian strategy' with a war of attrition and resulting disease manifestations. Additionally, much has been learned regarding the ever-increasing complexity of the host-response armamentarium at both cellular and molecular levels that is addressed in this review. Knowledge regarding how these systems fully interact requires both new laboratory and clinical tools, as well as sophisticated modeling of the networks that help maintain homeostasis and are dysregulated in disease. Finally, the triggers resulting in a 'coup de main' by the microbiome (exacerbation of disease) and the characteristics of susceptible hosts that can result in 'pyrrhic victories' with collateral damage to host tissues, the hallmark of periodontitis, remains unclear. While much has been learned, substantial gaps in our understanding of the 'parameters of this war' remain elusive toward fulfilling the Sun Tzu adage: 'If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles.'", "Prevalence of dysgraphia by age across all grade levels was determined in students with ADHD or autism.\nReferred children with normal intelligence and ADHD-Combined, ADHD-Inattentive, or autism ( N = 1,034) were administered the Developmental Test of Visual-Motor Integration (VMI) and Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC).\nVMI and WISC Coding scores were significantly lower than IQ and the normal mean of 100 for all diagnoses. More than half (59%) had dysgraphia, and 92% had a weakness in graphomotor ability relative to other abilities. Dysgraphia prevalence did not differ between diagnostic or age groups (6-7 years, 56%; 8-10 years, 60%; and 11-16 years, 61%).\nDysgraphia is common at all ages in children and adolescents with ADHD and autism. Accommodations and strategies for addressing this problem are discussed.", "Conflicting evidence concerning possible harm from mercury (Hg) in regard to offspring cognition if the woman eats fish has prompted this study to examine evidence from a British pre-birth cohort to investigate the relationship between the two.\nPregnant women (median prenatal blood mercury 1.86\u03bcg/L) resident in the study area with delivery between April 1991 and December 1992 were followed up and verbal, performance and total intelligence quotient (IQ) of 2062 offspring were measured at age 8. Analysis treated IQ as (a) continuous and (b) the lowest 25% of the distribution. Multiple and logistic regression analyses took account of social and demographic variables. Stratification considered children of fish eaters separately.\nBefore adjustment, mean full-scale IQ increased with increasing Hg (change with 1SD of Hg=+2.02; 95%CI+1.40,+2.64 IQ points; P <0.0001); after adjustment effect size was reduced although still positive (+0.61;95%CI -0.06,+1.29 IQ points; P=0.073). The adjusted positive relationship was stronger when fish-eating mothers were considered separately (+0.84:95%CI\u2009+0.13,+1.56 IQ points; P=0.021) in comparison with the outcomes for non-fish eaters, where the adjusted relationship was negative (-2.22;95%CI -5.00,+0.56 IQ points; P=0.117). The binary outcome showed a similar pattern with the adjusted OR for non-fish-eaters 1.79 (95%CI 1.10,2.93; P=0.019) per SD of Hg, significantly different from that for fish consumers (0.94;95%CI:0.82,1.08)(Pinteraction<0.05). There were no differences between the sexes in the associations, nor did the level of the mother's blood selenium change the effect sizes.\nThe relationship between intrauterine exposure to mercury and offspring IQ appears to be benign provided the mother consumes fish.", "Cerebral palsy describes the most common physical disability in childhood and occurs in 1 in 500 live births. Historically, the diagnosis has been made between age 12 and 24 months but now can be made before 6 months' corrected age.\nTo systematically review best available evidence for early, accurate diagnosis of cerebral palsy and to summarize best available evidence about cerebral palsy-specific early intervention that should follow early diagnosis to optimize neuroplasticity and function.\nThis study systematically searched the literature about early diagnosis of cerebral palsy in MEDLINE (1956-2016), EMBASE (1980-2016), CINAHL (1983-2016), and the Cochrane Library (1988-2016) and by hand searching. Search terms included cerebral palsy, diagnosis, detection, prediction, identification, predictive validity, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. The study included systematic reviews with or without meta-analyses, criteria of diagnostic accuracy, and evidence-based clinical guidelines. Findings are reported according to the PRISMA statement, and recommendations are reported according to the Appraisal of Guidelines, Research and Evaluation (AGREE) II instrument.\nSix systematic reviews and 2 evidence-based clinical guidelines met inclusion criteria. All included articles had high methodological Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS) ratings. In infants, clinical signs and symptoms of cerebral palsy emerge and evolve before age 2 years; therefore, a combination of standardized tools should be used to predict risk in conjunction with clinical history. Before 5 months' corrected age, the most predictive tools for detecting risk are term-age magnetic resonance imaging (86%-89% sensitivity), the Prechtl Qualitative Assessment of General Movements (98% sensitivity), and the Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination (90% sensitivity). After 5 months' corrected age, the most predictive tools for detecting risk are magnetic resonance imaging (86%-89% sensitivity) (where safe and feasible), the Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination (90% sensitivity), and the Developmental Assessment of Young Children (83% C index). Topography and severity of cerebral palsy are more difficult to ascertain in infancy, and magnetic resonance imaging and the Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination may be helpful in assisting clinical decisions. In high-income countries, 2 in 3 individuals with cerebral palsy will walk, 3 in 4 will talk, and 1 in 2 will have normal intelligence.\nEarly diagnosis begins with a medical history and involves using neuroimaging, standardized neurological, and standardized motor assessments that indicate congruent abnormal findings indicative of cerebral palsy. Clinicians should understand the importance of prompt referral to diagnostic-specific early intervention to optimize infant motor and cognitive plasticity, prevent secondary complications, and enhance caregiver well-being.", "The study examines the 5-year course of children with dyslexia with regard to their sex. Furthermore, the study investigates the impact of dyslexia on the performance in reading and spelling skills and school-related success.\nA group of 995 6- to 16-year-olds were examined at the initial assessment. Part of the initial sample was then re-examined after 43 and 63 months. The diagnosis of dyslexia was based on the double discrepancy criterion using a standard deviation of 1.5. Though they had no intellectual deficits, the children showed a considerable discrepancy between their reading or writing abilities and (1) their nonverbal intelligence and (2) the mean of their grade norm.\nNearly 70 % of those examined had a persisting diagnosis of dyslexia over a period of 63 months. The 5-year course was not influenced by sex. Despite average intelligence, the performance in writing and spelling of children suffering from dyslexia was one standard deviation below a control group without dyslexia with average intelligence and 0.5 standard deviations below a group of children suffering from intellectual deficits. Furthermore, the school-related success of the dyslexics was significantly lower than those of children with average intelligence. Dyslexics showed similar school-related success rates to children suffering from intellectual deficits.\nDyslexia represents a considerable developmental risk. The adverse impact of dyslexia on school-related success supports the importance of early diagnostics and intervention. It also underlines the need for reliable and general accepted diagnostic criteria. It is important to define such criteria in light of the prevalence rates.", "Self-efficacy affects our students' academic results, which may be related to people's social skills and emotional intelligence. This study included 1402 (50.71% males) Secondary Education Spanish students (12-17 years), and analysed the relation of self-efficacy with emotional intelligence and social skills. It showed how these constructs were related, and how the self-efficacy perceived by students varied according to their social skills and emotional intelligence. Gender did not influence self-efficacy, social skills and emotional intelligence. These variables showed similar correlation indices in females and males. Self-efficacy was related with social skills and emotional intelligence in Secondary Education students, but this relation was not gender-sensitive. More studies and research are needed to study and describe these variables according to gender from other perspectives. One proposal is to investigate the association between gender identity and self-efficacy and social skills and emotional intelligence to better understand how these constructs participate in adolescent development.", "This study tested whether adolescents who used cannabis or met criteria for cannabis dependence showed neuropsychological impairment prior to cannabis initiation and neuropsychological decline from before to after cannabis initiation.\nA longitudinal co-twin control study.\nParticipants were 1989 twins from the Environmental Risk (E-Risk) Longitudinal Twin Study, a nationally representative birth cohort of twins born in England and Wales from 1994 to 1995.\nFrequency of cannabis use and cannabis dependence were assessed at age 18. Intelligence quotient (IQ) was obtained at ages 5, 12 and 18. Executive functions were assessed at age 18.\nCompared with adolescents who did not use cannabis, adolescents who used cannabis had lower IQ in childhood prior to cannabis initiation and lower IQ at age 18, but there was little evidence that cannabis use was associated with IQ decline from ages 12-18. For example, adolescents with cannabis dependence had age 12 and age 18 IQ scores that were 5.61 (t\u00a0=\u00a0-3.11, P\u00a0=\u00a00.002) and 7.34 IQ points (t\u00a0=\u00a0-5.27, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) lower than adolescents without cannabis dependence, but adolescents with cannabis dependence did not show greater IQ decline from age 12-18 (t\u00a0=\u00a0-1.27, P\u00a0=\u00a00.20). Moreover, adolescents who used cannabis had poorer executive functions at age 18 than adolescents who did not use cannabis, but these associations were generally not apparent within twin pairs. For example, twins who used cannabis more frequently than their co-twin performed similarly to their co-twin on five of six executive function tests (Ps\u00a0>\u00a00.10). The one exception was that twins who used cannabis more frequently than their co-twin performed worse on one working memory test (Spatial Span reversed; \u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-0.07, P\u00a0=\u00a00.036).\nShort-term cannabis use in adolescence does not appear to cause IQ decline or impair executive functions, even when cannabis use reaches the level of dependence. Family background factors explain why adolescent cannabis users perform worse on IQ and executive function tests.", "We estimated genotype by environment interaction (G\u2009\u00d7\u2009E) on later cognitive performance and educational attainment across four unique environments, i.e. 1) breastfed without maternal smoking, 2) breastfed with maternal smoking, 3) non-breastfed without maternal smoking and 4) non-breastfed with maternal smoking, using a novel design and statistical approach that was facilitated by the availability of datasets with the genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). There was significant G\u2009\u00d7\u2009E for both fluid intelligence (p-value\u2009=\u20091.0E-03) and educational attainment (p-value\u2009=\u20098.3E-05) when comparing genetic effects in the group of individuals who were breastfed without maternal smoking with those not breastfed without maternal smoking. There was also significant G\u2009\u00d7\u2009E for fluid intelligence (p-value\u2009=\u20093.9E-05) when comparing the group of individuals who were breastfed with maternal smoking with those not breastfed without maternal smoking. Genome-wide significant SNPs were different between different environmental groups. Genomic prediction accuracies were significantly higher when using the target and discovery sample from the same environmental group than when using those from the different environmental groups. This finding demonstrates G\u2009\u00d7\u2009E has important implications for future studies on the genetic architecture, genome-wide association studies and genomic predictions.", "Previous models or hypotheses of autism spectral disorder (ASD) failed to take into full consideration the chronological and causal developmental trajectory, leading to the emergence of diverse phenotypes through a complex interaction between individual etiologies and environmental factors. Those phenotypes include persistent deficits in social communication and social interaction (criteria A in DSM-5), and restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities (criteria B in DSM-5). In this article, we proposed a domain-general model that can explain criteria in DSM-5 based on the assumption that the same etiological mechanism would trigger the various phenotypes observed in different individuals with ASD. In the model, we assumed the following joint causes as the etiology of autism: (1) Hypoplasia of the pons in the brainstem, occurring immediately following neural tube closure; and (2) Deficiency in the GABA (\u03b3-aminobutyric acid) developmental switch during the perinatal period. Microstructural abnormalities of the pons directly affect both the structural and functional development of the brain areas strongly connected to it, especially amygdala. The impairment of GABA switch could not only lead to the deterioration of inhibitory processing in the neural network, but could also cause abnormal cytoarchitecture. We introduced a perspective that atypical development in both brain structure and function can give full explanation of diverse phenotypes and pathogenetic mechanism of ASD. Finally, we discussed about neural mechanisms underlying the phenotypic characteristics of ASD that are not described in DSM-5 but should be considered as important foundation: sleep, global precedence, categorical perception, intelligence, interoception and motor control.", "The distinction between autism and Asperger syndrome has been abandoned in the DSM-5. However, this clinical categorization largely overlaps with the presence or absence of a speech onset delay which is associated with clinical, cognitive, and neural differences. It is unknown whether these different speech development pathways and associated cognitive differences are involved in the heterogeneity of the restricted interests that characterize autistic adults.\nThis study tested the hypothesis that speech onset delay, or conversely, early mastery of speech, orients the nature and verbal reporting of adult autistic interests. The occurrence of a priori defined descriptors for perceptual and thematic dimensions were determined, as well as the perceived function and benefits, in the response of autistic people to a semi-structured interview on their intense interests. The number of words, grammatical categories, and proportion of perceptual/thematic descriptors were computed and compared between groups by variance analyses. The participants comprised 40 autistic adults grouped according to the presence (N\u00a0=\u00a020) or absence (N\u00a0=\u00a020) of speech onset delay, as well as 20 non-autistic adults, also with intense interests, matched for non-verbal intelligence using Raven's Progressive Matrices.\nThe overall nature, function, and benefit of intense interests were similar across autistic subgroups, and between autistic and non-autistic groups. However, autistic participants with a history of speech onset delay used more perceptual than thematic descriptors when talking about their interests, whereas the opposite was true for autistic individuals without speech onset delay. This finding remained significant after controlling for linguistic differences observed between the two groups.\nVerbal reporting, but not the nature or positive function, of intense interests differed between adult autistic individuals depending on their speech acquisition history: oral reporting of intense interests was characterized by perceptual dominance for autistic individuals with delayed speech onset and thematic dominance for those without. This may contribute to the heterogeneous presentation observed among autistic adults of normal intelligence.", "Social (pragmatic) communication disorder (SPCD) is a new diagnosis introduced by DSM-5, characterised by problems with verbal and nonverbal social communication. It is currently unclear whether SPCD is a valid diagnostic category, because little is known about the characteristics of those who meet its criteria. We sought to identify and describe cases of SPCD, to contribute to debates about its validity. We investigated whether the symptoms of SPCD cluster together to form a coherent syndrome that is distinct from autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in terms of its core and associated features.\nParticipants were young people (N\u00a0=\u00a01,081, age range\u00a0=\u00a04-18\u00a0years) who had attended a specialist social communication disorders clinic for children with fluent language and normal-range intelligence. Standardised parent-report data were collected using the Developmental, Dimensional and Diagnostic Interview (3Di), Child Communication Checklist (CCC) and Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). An algorithm was designed using 3Di and CCC items to implement DSM-5 SPCD criteria.\nEighty-eight young people met our criteria for SPCD, with 801 meeting DSM-5 ASD criteria and the remaining 192 having neither SPCD nor ASD ('clinical comparison group'). The core symptoms of SPCD co-occurred to a moderate degree (average interitem correlation\u00a0=\u00a0.22). SPCD cases had autistic social difficulties that were intermediate between ASD and the clinical comparison group. SPCD was associated with high rates of nonautistic psychopathology, with 63.5% scoring in the abnormal range of the SDQ's Total Problems scale.\nWe did not find evidence that SPCD is qualitatively distinct from ASD. Rather, it appears to lie on the borderlands of the autism spectrum, describing those with autistic traits that fall just below the threshold for an ASD diagnosis. SPCD may have clinical utility for identifying people with autistic traits that are insufficiently severe for ASD diagnosis, but who nevertheless require support.", "Multiple neuroimaging studies have now linked emotional awareness (EA), as measured by the Levels of Emotional Awareness Scale (LEAS), with activation in regions of neural networks associated with both conceptualization (i.e., default mode network [DMN] regions) and interoception (i.e., salience network [SN] regions) - consistent with the definition of EA as one's ability to appropriately recognize, conceptualize, and articulate the emotions of self and other in fine-grained, differentiated ways. However, no study has yet tested the hypothesis that greater LEAS scores are associated with greater resting state functional connectivity (FC) within these networks. Twenty-six adults (13 female) underwent resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging, and also completed the LEAS. Using pre-defined functional ROIs from the DMN and SN, we observed that LEAS scores were significantly positively correlated with FC between several regions of both of these networks, even when controlling for differences in general intelligence (IQ). These results suggest that higher EA may be associated with more efficient information exchange between brain regions involved in both interoception- and conceptualization-based processing, which could plausibly contribute to more differentiated bodily feelings and more fine-grained conceptualization of those feelings.", "The purpose of this study was to investigate differences between non-specific computer training (NCT) and cognition-specific computer training (CCT).\nRandomized controlled experimental study.\nLocal community welfare center.\nA total of 78 subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) were randomly assigned to the NCT ( n\u2009=\u200939) or CCT group ( n\u2009=\u200939).\nThe NCT group underwent NCT using Nintendo Wii for improving functional performance, while the CCT group underwent CCT using CoTras for improving function of the cognitive domain specifically. Subjects in both groups received 30-minute intervention three times a week for 10\u2009weeks.\nTo identify effects on cognitive function, the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) digit span subtests, Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT), Trail Making Test-Part B (TMT-B), Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Test, and Modified Taylor Complex Figure (MTCF) were used. Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) was assessed using the Short-Form 36-item questionnaire.\nAfter 10\u2009weeks, the WAIS subtests (digit span forward: 0.48\u2009\u00b1\u20090.08 vs. 0.12\u2009\u00b1\u20090.04; digit span backward: 0.46\u2009\u00b1\u20090.09 vs. 0.11\u2009\u00b1\u20090.04) and HRQoL (vitality: 9.05\u2009\u00b1\u20091.17 vs. 2.69\u2009\u00b1\u20091.67; role-emotional: 8.31\u2009\u00b1\u20091.20 vs. 4.15\u2009\u00b1\u20090.71; mental health: 11.62\u2009\u00b1\u20091.63 vs. 6.95\u2009\u00b1\u20091.75; bodily pain: 4.21\u2009\u00b1\u20092.17 vs. 0.10\u2009\u00b1\u20090.38) were significantly higher in the NCT group ( P\u2009<\u20090.05).\nNCT was superior to CCT for improving cognitive function and HRQoL of elderly adults with MCI.", "Studies assessing sex/gender differences in autism spectrum conditions often fail to include typically developing control groups. It is, therefore, unclear whether observed sex/gender differences reflect those found in the general population or are particular to autism spectrum conditions. A systematic search identified articles comparing behavioural and cognitive characteristics in males and females with and without an autism spectrum condition diagnosis. A total of 13 studies were included in meta-analyses of sex/gender differences in core autism spectrum condition symptoms (social/communication impairments and restricted/repetitive behaviours and interests) and intelligence quotient. A total of 20 studies were included in a qualitative review of sex/gender differences in additional autism spectrum condition symptoms. For core traits and intelligence quotient, sex/gender differences were comparable in autism spectrum conditions and typical samples. Some additional autism spectrum condition symptoms displayed different patterns of sex/gender differences in autism spectrum conditions and typically developing groups, including measures of executive function, empathising and systemising traits, internalising and externalising problems and play behaviours. Individuals with autism spectrum conditions display typical sex/gender differences in core autism spectrum condition traits, suggesting that diagnostic criteria based on these symptoms should take into account typical sex/gender differences. However, awareness of associated autism spectrum condition symptoms should include the possibility of different male and female phenotypes, to ensure those who do not fit the 'typical' autism spectrum condition presentation are not missed.", "To (1) compare the neurodevelopmental outcomes at 8 years of age of children born extremely preterm (EP) who underwent surgical procedures during the course of their initial hospital admission with those who did not and (2) compare the outcomes across eras, from 1991 to 2005.\nProspective observational cohort studies conducted over three different eras (1991-1992, 1997 and 2005). Surviving EP children, who required surgical intervention during the primary hospitalisation, were assessed for general intelligence (IQ) and neurosensory status at 8 years of age. Major neurosensory disability comprised any of moderate/severe cerebral palsy, IQ less than -2 SD relative to term controls, blindness or deafness.\nOverall, 29% (161/546) of survivors had surgery during the newborn period, with similar rates in each era. Follow-up rates at 8 years were high (91%; 499/546), and 17% (86/499) of survivors assessed had a major neurosensory disability. Rates of major neurosensory disability were substantially higher in the surgical group (33%; 52/158) compared with those who did not have surgery (10%; 34/341) (OR 4.28, 95% CI 2.61 to 7.03). Rates of disability in the surgical group did not improve over time. After adjustment for relevant confounders, no specific surgical procedure was associated with increased risk of disability.\nMajor neurosensory disability at 8 years was higher in children born EP who underwent surgery during their initial hospital admission compared with those who did not. The rates of major neurosensory disability in the surgical cohort are not improving over time.", "Prenatal polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) exposure has been associated with decrements in IQ and increased attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder related behaviors in children; however, data are limited for the role of postnatal exposures.\nWe investigated the association between a series of childhood PBDE concentrations and Full-Scale Intelligence Quotient (FSIQ) and externalizing problems at 8 years.\nWe used data from 208 children in the Health Outcomes and Measures of the Environment (HOME) Study, a prospective pregnancy and birth cohort. Child serum PBDEs were measured at 1, 2, 3, 5, and 8 years; missing serum PBDE concentrations were estimated via multiple imputation. The Wechsler Intelligence Scales for Children-IV and the Behavior Assessment System for Children-2 was used to assess intelligence and externalizing behavior, respectively, in children at 8 years. We used multiple informant models to estimate associations between repeated lipid-adjusted PBDEs and child neurobehavior and to test for windows of susceptibility.\nPostnatal exposure to PBDE congeners (- 28, - 47, -\u00a099, - 100, and - 153) at multiple ages was inversely associated with FSIQ at 8 years. For instance, a 10-fold increase in BDE-153 concentrations at 2, 3, 5, and 8 years were all related to lower FSIQ at age 8 (\u03b2 for 3 years: - 7.7-points, 95% CI - 12.5, - 2.9; \u03b2 for 8 years: - 5.6-points, 95% CI - 10.8, - 0.4). Multiple PBDE congeners at 8 years were associated with increased hyperactivity and aggressive behaviors at 8 years.\nPostnatal PBDE exposure was associated with decrements in FSIQ and increases in hyperactivity and aggressive behaviors.", "In addition to high intelligence, humans evolved specialized social-cognitive skills, which are specifically affected in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Genes affected in ASD represent suitable candidates to study the evolution of human social cognition. We performed an evolutionary analysis on 68 genes associated to neurodevelopmental disorders; our data indicate that genetic diversity was shaped by distinct selective forces, including natural selection and introgression from archaic hominins. We discuss the possibility that segregation distortion during spermatogenesis accounts for a subset of ASD mutations. Finally, we detected modern-human-specific alleles in DYRK1A and TCF4. These variants are located within regions that display chromatin features typical of transcriptional enhancers in several brain areas, strongly suggesting a regulatory role. These SNPs thus represent candidates for association with neurodevelopmental disorders, and await experimental validation in future studies.", "Adaptive behavior can be impaired in different neurodevelopmental disorders and may be influenced by confounding factors, such as intelligence quotient (IQ) and socioeconomic classification. Our main objective was to verify whether adaptive behavior profiles differ in three conditions-Williams Beuren syndrome (WBS), Down syndrome (DS), and autism spectrum disorder (ASD), as compared with healthy controls (HC) and with each other. Although the literature points towards each disorder having a characteristic profile, no study has compared profiles to establish the specificity of each one. A secondary objective was to explore potential interactions between the conditions and socioeconomic status, and whether this had any effect on adaptive behavior profiles.\nOne hundred and five adolescents were included in the study. All adolescents underwent the following evaluations: the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale (VABS), the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC), and the Brazilian Economic Classification Criteria.\nOur results demonstrated that the WBS group performed better than the DS group in the communication domain, \u03b2 = -15.08, t(3.45), p = .005, and better than the ASD group in the socialization domain, \u03b2 = 8.92, t(-2.08), p = .013. The DS group also performed better than the ASD group in socialization, \u03b2 = 16.98, t(-2.32), p = .024. IQ was an important confounding factor, and socioeconomic status had an important effect on the adaptive behavior of all groups.\nThere is a heterogeneity regarding adaptive behavior profiles in WBS, DS, and ASD. These data are important to better design specific strategies related to the health and social care of each particular group.", "Contralateral associated movements (CAMs) frequently occur in complex motor tasks. We investigated whether and to what extent CAMs are associated with inhibitory control among preschool children in the Swiss Preschoolers' Health Study. Participants were 476 healthy, typically developing children (mean age\u2009=\u20093.88 years; 251 boys) evaluated on two consecutive afternoons. The children performed the Zurich Neuromotor Assessment, the statue subtest of the Neuropsychological Assessment for Children (NEPSY), and cognitive tests of the Intelligence and Development Scales-Preschool (IDS-P). CAMs were associated with poor inhibitory control on the statue test and poor selective attention and visual perception on the IDS-P. We attributed these findings to preschoolers' general immaturity of the central nervous system.", "There are limited data on the use of artificial intelligence methods for the diagnosis of dementia in epidemiological studies in low- and middle-income country (LMIC) settings. A culture and education fair battery of cognitive tests was developed and validated for population based studies in low- and middle-income countries including India by the 10/66 Dementia Research Group.\nWe explored the machine learning methods based on the 10/66 battery of cognitive tests for the diagnosis of dementia based in a birth cohort study in South India.\nThe data sets for 466 men and women for this study were obtained from the on-going Mysore Studies of Natal effect of Health and Ageing (MYNAH), in south India. The data sets included: demographics, performance on the 10/66 cognitive function tests, the 10/66 diagnosis of mental disorders and population based normative data for the 10/66 battery of cognitive function tests. Diagnosis of dementia from the rule based approach was compared against the 10/66 diagnosis of dementia. We have applied machine learning techniques to identify minimal number of the 10/66 cognitive function tests required for diagnosing dementia and derived an algorithm to improve the accuracy of dementia diagnosis.\nOf 466 subjects, 27 had 10/66 diagnosis of dementia, 19 of whom were correctly identified as having dementia by Jrip classification with 100% accuracy.\nThis pilot exploratory study indicates that machine learning methods can help identify community dwelling older adults with 10/66 criterion diagnosis of dementia with good accuracy in a LMIC setting such as India. This should reduce the duration of the diagnostic assessment and make the process easier and quicker for clinicians, patients and will be useful for 'case' ascertainment in population based epidemiological studies.", "Chronic pain is a significant comorbidity in individuals with alcohol dependence (AD). Emotional processing deficits are a substantial component of both AD and chronic pain. The aim of this study was to analyze the interrelations between components of emotional intelligence and self-reported pain severity in AD patients.\nA sample of 103 participants was recruited from an alcohol treatment center in Warsaw, Poland. Information concerning pain level in the last 4 weeks, demographics, severity of current anxiety and depressive symptoms, as well as neuroticism was obtained. The study sample was divided into \"mild or no pain\" and \"moderate or greater pain\" groups.\nIn the logistic regression model, across a set of sociodemographic, psychological, and clinical factors, higher emotion regulation and higher education predicted lower severity, whereas increased levels of anxiety predicted higher severity of self-reported pain during the previous 4 weeks. When the mediation models looking at the association between current severity of anxiety and depressive symptoms and pain severity with the mediating role of emotion regulation were tested, emotion regulation appeared to fully mediate the relationship between depression severity and pain, and partially the relationship between anxiety severity and pain.\nThe current findings extend previous results indicating that emotion regulation deficits are related to self-reported pain in AD subjects. Comprehensive strategies focusing on the improvement of mood regulation skills might be effective in the treatment of AD patients with comorbid pain symptoms.", "Higher intelligence in childhood is associated with lower lifetime risk of major causes of death, including heart disease, stroke, smoking-related cancers, respiratory disease and dementia.", "Autism is defined by persistent deficits in social communication and social interaction in multiple contexts as well as restricted and repetitive patterns of behavior. There are also reported difficulties in the dynamic activation and modification of cognitive processes in response to changes in tasks' demands. Such difficulties are believed to be due to poor flexible cognition. This research aimed to assess and intervene in cognitive flexibility in subjects with autism.Ten subjects diagnosed with autism by psychiatrists, aged 5\u00a0years to 13\u00a0years and 5\u00a0months, were assessed in non-verbal intelligence through Raven's Progressive Matrices in pretest. They were also assessed in cognitive flexibility through Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) and in patterns of social interactions, behaviors, and communication through Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R). An intervention program of 14 to 21 sessions was established to enhance cognitive flexibility. In posttest, they were assessed in WCST and ADI-R.All measures of cognitive flexibility improved in posttest except for failure to maintain set. Among the measures improved in posttest, perseverative errors and responses improved in posttest with statistical significance as well as categories completed. Total scores on ADI-R were lower in posttest as well as scores on communication abilities.The qualitative improvement showed by the individuals of this research concerning cognitive flexibility and also patterns of restricted behavior, social interaction, and communication abilities suggests that individuals with autism can benefit from the development of strategies for the enhancement of cognitive flexibility. Nevertheless, more research is suggested with a larger sample among subjects on the autism spectrum.", "Psychomotricity plays a very important role in children's development, especially for learning involving reading-writing and mathematical calculations. Evaluate motor development in children 3\u00a0years old and its relationship with their cognitive abilities at the age of 5\u00a0years. Based on a cohort study, we analyzed the information about motor performance evaluated at 3\u00a0years old by Peabody Motor Scale and cognitive abilities at 5\u00a0years old. The association was estimated using linear regression models adjusted by mother's intelligence quotient, sex, Bayley mental development index at 18\u00a0months, and quality of the environment at home (HOME scale). 148 children whose motor performance was determined at age 3 and was evaluated later at age 5 to determine their cognitive abilities. Cognitive abilities (verbal, quantitative, and memory) measured by McCarthy Scales. Significant positive associations were observed between stationary balance at age 3 with verbal abilities (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.67, p\u00a0=\u00a0.04) and memory (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.81, p\u00a0=\u00a0.02) at 5\u00a0years. Grasping and visual-motor integration were significant and positively associated with quantitative abilities (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.74, p\u00a0=\u00a0.005; \u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.61, p\u00a0=\u00a0.01) and memory (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a02.11, p\u00a0=\u00a0.001; \u03b2\u00a0=\u00a01.74, p\u00a0=\u00a0.004). The results suggest that early motor performance contributes to the establishment of cognitive abilities at 5\u00a0years. Evaluation and early motor stimulation before the child is faced with formal learning likely helps to create neuronal networks that facilitate the acquisition of academic knowledge.", "Examine the association of cognitive reserve (CR) factors (estimated premorbid intelligence quotient [IQ], years of education, and occupational attainment) and traumatic brain injury (TBI) severity with functional and neuropsychological outcomes 1 to 5 years following TBI.\nPatients with mild (N = 58), moderate (N = 25), or severe (N = 17) TBI.\nCognitive reserve factors (estimated premorbid IQ, years of education, and occupational attainment); neuropsychological test battery; Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended; Short Form-36 Health Survey.\nSpearman-Brown correlations, linear regression models, and analyses of covariance were used to analyze the relation between CR factors and outcome measures.\nAnalyses revealed significant relations between estimated premorbid IQ and neuropsychological outcomes (P < .004): California Verbal Learning Test, Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Fourth Edition working memory, Booklet Category Test, Trail Making Test B, and Grooved Pegboard Test. There was also a significant correlation between estimated premorbid IQ and Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Fourth Edition processing speed. Years of education had significant relations with California Verbal Learning Test and Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Fourth Edition working memory and processing speed scores. There were significant differences between TBI severity groups and performance on the Trail Making Test A, Grooved Pegboard Test, and Finger Tapping Test.\nCognitive reserve factors may be associated with outcomes following TBI. Additional alternatives to TBI severity are needed to help guide rehabilitative planning postinjury.", "Bipolar disorder type-I (BD-I) patients show a lower Intelligence Quotient (IQ) and smaller brain volumes as compared with healthy controls. Considering that in healthy individuals lower IQ is related to smaller total brain volume, it is of interest to investigate whether IQ deficits in BD-I patients are related to smaller brain volumes and to what extent smaller brain volumes can explain differences between premorbid IQ estimates and IQ after a diagnosis of BD-I.\nMagnetic resonance imaging brain scans, IQ and premorbid IQ scores were obtained from 195 BDI patients and 160 controls. We studied the relationship of (global, cortical and subcortical) brain volumes with IQ and IQ change. Additionally, we investigated the relationship between childhood trauma, lithium- and antipsychotic use and IQ.\nTotal brain volume and IQ were positively correlated in the entire sample. This correlation did not differ between patients and controls. Although brain volumes mediated the relationship between BD-I and IQ in part, the direct relationship between the diagnosis and IQ remained significant. Childhood trauma and use of lithium and antipsychotic medication did not affect the relationship between brain volumes and IQ. However, current lithium use was related to lower IQ in patients.\nOur data suggest a similar relationship between brain volume and IQ in BD-I patients and controls. Smaller brain volumes only partially explain IQ deficits in patients. Therefore, our findings indicate that in addition to brain volumes and lithium use other disease factors play a role in IQ deficits in BD-I patients.", "Sleep paralysis is a relatively common but under-researched phenomenon. While the causes are unknown, a number of studies have investigated potential risk factors. In this article, we conducted a systematic review on the available literature regarding variables associated with both the frequency and intensity of sleep paralysis episodes. A total of 42 studies met the inclusion criteria. For each study, sample size, study site, sex and age of participants, sleep paralysis measure, and results of analyses looking at the relationship(s) between sleep paralysis and associated variable(s) were extracted. A large number of variables were associated with sleep paralysis and a number of themes emerged. These were: substance use, stress and trauma, genetic influences, physical illness, personality, intelligence, anomalous beliefs, sleep problems and disorders (both in terms of subjective sleep quality and objective sleep disruption), symptoms of psychiatric illness in non-clinical samples (particularly anxiety symptoms), and psychiatric disorders. Sleep paralysis appears to be particularly prevalent in post-traumatic stress disorder, and to a less degree, panic disorder. Limitations of the current literature, directions for future research, and implications for clinical practice are discussed.", "Cerebrovascular risk factors (eg, hypertension, coronary artery disease) and stroke can lead to vascular cognitive impairment. The Asymptomatic Carotid Stenosis and Cognitive Function study evaluated the isolated impact of asymptomatic carotid stenosis (no prior ipsilateral or contralateral stroke or transient ischemic attack) on cognitive function. Cerebrovascular hemodynamic and carotid plaque characteristics were analyzed to elucidate potential mechanisms affecting cognition.\nThere were 82 patients with \u226550% asymptomatic carotid stenosis and 62 controls without stenosis but matched for vascular comorbidities who underwent neurologic, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, and comprehensive neuropsychological examination. Overall cognitive function and five domain-specific scores were computed. Duplex ultrasound with Doppler waveform and B-mode imaging defined the degree of stenosis, least luminal diameter, plaque area, and plaque gray-scale median. Breath-holding index (BHI) and microembolization were measured using transcranial Doppler. We assessed cognitive differences between stenosis patients and control patients and of stenosis patients with low vs high BHI and correlated cognitive function with microembolic counts and plaque characteristics.\nStenosis and control patients did not differ in vascular risk factors, education, estimated intelligence, or depressive symptoms. Stenosis patients had worse composite cognitive scores (P\u00a0= .02; Cohen's d\u00a0= 0.43) and domain-specific scores for learning/memory (P\u00a0= .02; d\u00a0= 0.42) and motor/processing speed (P\u00a0= .01; d\u00a0= 0.65), whereas scores for executive function were numerically lower (P\u00a0= .08). Approximately 49.4% of all stenosis patients were impaired in at least two cognitive domains. Precisely 50% of stenosis patients demonstrated a reduced BHI. Stenosis patients with reduced BHI performed worse on the overall composite cognitive score (t\u00a0=\u00a0-2.1; P\u00a0= .02; d\u00a0= 0.53) and tests for learning/memory (t\u00a0=\u00a0-2.7; P\u00a0= .01; d\u00a0= 0.66). Cognitive function did not correlate with measures of plaque burden (degree of stenosis, least luminal diameter, and plaque area) or with plaque gray-scale median.\nAsymptomatic carotid stenosis is associated with cognitive impairment independent of known vascular risk factors for vascular cognitive impairment. Approximately 49.4% of these patients demonstrate impairment in at least two neuropsychological domains. The deficit is driven primarily by reduced motor/processing speed and learning/memory and is mild to moderate in severity. The mechanism for impairment is likely to be hemodynamic as evidenced by reduced cerebrovascular reserve and the likely result of hypoperfusion from a pressure drop across the stenosis in the presence of inadequate collateralization.", "To characterize cognitive alterations among patients with HTLV-1, ascertain what is associated with these alterations and evaluate these patients' quality of life.\nThis was a cross-sectional study. Patients infected by HTLV-1 who were seen at the Oswaldo Cruz University Hospital from March 2014 to June 2015 were included in the study. A semi-structured questionnaire and the Mini-Mental State Examination, Color Trails Test, Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS-III), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF36) were used. \"Low IQ\" scores were defined for WAIS-III as under 80 points. Results Fifty-five patients were evaluated: 26% presented altered MMSE, 38%, altered Color Trails Test; 10.9% presented low total IQ; 12.7%, low executive IQ; and 10.9%, low verbal IQ. There was no association between low total IQ and any characteristics of the patient or of the HTLV infection. Paraparesis and anxiety disorders were significantly associated with worse quality of life.\nHigh frequency of cognitive impairment was found in patients with HTLV, thus suggesting that these alterations are an important clinical manifestation of this virus.", "Spatial navigation is a crucial ability for living. Previous studies have shown that males are better at navigation than females, but little is known about the neural basis underlying the sex differences. In this study, we investigated whether cortical scene processing in three well-established scene-selective regions was sexually different, by examining sex differences in scene selectivity and its behavioral relevance to navigation. To do this, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to scan the parahippocampal place area (PPA), retrosplenial complex (RSC), and occipital place area (OPA) in a large cohort of healthy young adults viewing navigationally relevant scenes (N\u00a0=\u00a0202), and correlated their neural selectivity to scenes with their self-reported navigational ability. Behaviorally, we replicated the previous finding that males were better at navigation than females. Neurally, we found that the scene selectivity in the bilateral PPA, not in the RSC or OPA, was significantly higher in males than females. Such differences could not be explained by confounding factors including brain size and fMRI data quality. Importantly, males, not females, with stronger scene selectivity in the left PPA possessed better navigational ability. This brain-behavior association could not be accounted for by non-navigational abilities (i.e., intelligence and mental rotation ability). Overall, our study provides novel empirical evidence demonstrating sex differences in the brain activity, inviting further studies on sex differences in the neural network for spatial navigation.", "The classic mental rotation task (MRT; Shepard & Metzler, 1971) is commonly thought to measure mental rotation, a cognitive process involving covert simulation of motor rotation. Yet much research suggests that the MRT recruits both motor simulation and other analytic cognitive strategies that depend on visuospatial representation and visual working memory (WM). In the present study, we investigated cognitive strategies in the MRT using time-frequency analysis of EEG and independent component analysis. We scrutinized sensorimotor mu (\u00b5) power reduction, associated with motor simulation, parietal alpha (p\u03b1) power reduction, associated with visuospatial representation, and frontal midline theta (fm\u03b8) power enhancement, associated with WM maintenance and manipulation. \u00b5 power increased concomitant with increasing task difficulty, suggesting reduced use of motor simulation, while p\u03b1 decreased and fm\u03b8 power increased, suggesting heightened use of visuospatial representation processing and WM, respectively. These findings suggest that MRT performance involves flexibly trading off between cognitive strategies, namely a motor simulation-based mental rotation strategy and WM-intensive analytic strategies based on task difficulty. Flexible cognitive strategy use may be a domain-general cognitive principle that underlies aptitude and spatial intelligence in a variety of cognitive domains. We close with discussion of the present study's implications as well as future directions.", "Impairments in reading and in language have negative consequences on life outcomes, but it is not known to what extent genetic effects influence this association. We constructed polygenic scores for difficulties with language and learning to read from genome-wide data in ~6,600 children, adolescents and young adults, and tested their association with health, socioeconomic outcomes and brain structure measures collected in adults (maximal N\u2009=\u2009111,749). Polygenic risk of reading difficulties was associated with reduced income, educational attainment, self-rated health and verbal-numerical reasoning (p\u2009<\u20090.00055). Polygenic risk of language difficulties predicted income (p\u2009=\u20090.0005). The small effect sizes ranged 0.01-0.03 of a standard deviation, but these will increase as genetic studies for reading ability get larger. Polygenic scores for childhood cognitive ability and educational attainment were correlated with polygenic scores of reading and language (up to 0.09 and 0.05, respectively). But when they were included in the prediction models, the observed associations between polygenic reading and adult outcomes mostly remained. This suggests that the pathway from reading ability to social outcomes is not only via associated polygenic loads for general cognitive function and educational attainment. The presence of non-overlapping genetic effect is indicated by the genetic correlations of around 0.40 (childhood intelligence) and 0.70 (educational attainment) with reading ability. Mendelian randomization approaches will be important to dissociate any causal and moderating effects of reading and related traits on social outcomes.", "While Healthy People 2020 calls for a reduction of bullying among high school students as a public health priority, earlier intervention supported by Occupational Therapists may be warranted. The current study investigated the prevalence of bullying behaviors within an elementary school, compared the experiences of victims with those of perpetrators, and determined when and for whom Trait Emotional Intelligence is a predictor of bullying and victimization. Elementary school children ( n = 235) in Grades 3 to 5 completed the Forms of Bullying Scale-Victim, the Forms of Bullying Scale-Perpetrator, and the Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire-Child Short Form. The prevalence of bully-only perpetration was 3.0%, of victimization-only was 48.5%, and of bully-victimization was 10.4%. Trait Emotional Intelligence was negatively associated with bullying. Trait Emotional Intelligence was negatively associated with victimization in boys, but not girls. The findings are discussed within the need to provide instruction and services to students at an early age.", "The assessment of autism in individuals with mild intellectual disabilities (MID) is complicated because of the overlap between autistic traits and intellectual limitations. Impaired social emotional reciprocity is a core diagnostic criterion for autism. However, it is unknown whether reciprocal behaviour differs between MID individuals with or without an autism spectrum disorder (ASD). This study explored differences in reciprocal behaviour of 35 children and adolescents with MID (intelligence quotient 50-85): 15 with ASD (ASD-MID) and 20 with typical development (TD-MID) using the Interactive Drawing Test (IDT). ASD-MID participants showed a lower quality of reciprocal behaviour compared with TD-MID participants. The difference in quality of reciprocal behaviour between ASD-MID and TD-MID participants was not significantly related with Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test scores and thus not attributable to verbal capacity. The IDT is likely to reflect the child's inclination to display reciprocal behaviour in everyday situations, as its scale scores were meaningfully associated with the level of social cognition assessed with the Social Responsiveness Scale. Thus, the IDT seems well suited for measuring impairments in reciprocal behaviour in children and adolescents with MID.", "This article argues that the creation of artificial offspring could make our lives more meaningful (i.e. satisfy more meaning-relevant conditions of value). By 'artificial offspring' I mean beings that we construct, with a mix of human and non-human-like qualities. Robotic artificial intelligences are paradigmatic examples of the form. There are two reasons for thinking that the creation of such beings could make our lives more meaningful and valuable. The first is that the existence of a collective afterlife-i.e. a set of human-like lives that continue after we die-is likely to be an important source and sustainer of meaning in our present lives (Scheffler in Death and the afterlife, OUP, Oxford, 2013). The second is that the creation of artificial offspring provides a plausible and potentially better pathway to a collective afterlife than the traditional biological pathway (i.e. there are reasons to favour this pathway and there are no good defeaters to trying it out). Both of these arguments are defended from a variety of objections and misunderstandings.", "During the last decades eco-friendly, low-cost, sustainable construction materials for utilization in civil engineering projects have attracted much attention. To this end, soilcretes are non-conventional construction materials produced by mixing natural soil such as natural clay or limestone sand with a hydraulic binder and are recently under detailed and in-depth investigation by many researchers. In this paper the results of the physical and mechanical characteristics of a large set of cylindrical specimens under uniaxial compression, are presented. Specifically, two types of soils such as sand and clay with metakaolin as a mineral additive have been used. This database can be extremely valuable for better understanding of the behavior of soilcrete materials. Furthermore, the results presented herein expected to be of great interest for researchers who deal with the prediction of mechanical properties of materials using soft computing techniques such as artificial intelligence (AI) techniques.", "BackgroundThis study aims to (i) compare volumes of individual basal ganglia nuclei (caudate nucleus, pallidum, and putamen) and the thalamus between very preterm (VP) and term-born infants at term-equivalent age; (ii) explore neonatal basal ganglia and thalamic volume relationships with 7-year neurodevelopmental outcomes, and whether these relationships differed between VP and term-born children.Methods210 VP (<30 weeks' gestational age) and 39 term-born (\u226537 weeks' gestational age) infants underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging at term-equivalent age, and deep gray matter volumes of interest were automatically generated. 186 VP and 37 term-born children were assessed for a range of neurodevelopmental measures at age 7 years.ResultsAll deep gray matter structures examined were smaller in VP infants compared with controls at term-equivalent age; ranging from (percentage mean difference (95% confidence intervals) -6.2% (-10.2%, -2.2%) for the putamen, to -9.5% (-13.9%, -5.1%) for the caudate nucleus. Neonatal basal ganglia and thalamic volumes were positively related to motor, intelligence quotient, and academic outcomes at age 7 years, with mostly similar relationships in the VP and control groups.ConclusionVP birth results in smaller basal ganglia and thalamic volumes at term-equivalent age, and these smaller volumes are related to a range of 7-year neurodevelopmental deficits in VP children.", "Despite how important it is to assess executive functioning in persons with Intellectual Disability (ID), instruments adapted and validated for this population are scarce. This study's primary goal was to find evidence for the validity of the ID version of the Tower of London (TOLDXtm) test in persons with mild (IDMi) and moderate (IDMo) levels of ID with Down Syndrome (DS). A multicenter study was carried out. Subjects (n = 63, \u2265 39 years old) had DS with mild (n = 39) or moderate ID (n = 24) with no minor neurocognitive disorder or Alzheimer's disease. Assessment protocol: TOLDXtm for ID, Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test Second Edition (K-BIT II), Cambridge Examination for Mental Disorders of Older People with Down's Syndrome and Others with Intellectual Disabilities (CAMDEX-DS), Weigl's Color-Form Sorting Test (WCFST), Barcelona Test for Intellectual Disability (BT-ID), and the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF-P). The internal consistency (IDMi and IDMo), factor structure of the different subscales, and relationship between TOLDXtm subscales and other cognitive measures (BT-ID, WCFST, and BRIEF-P) were analyzed. A normative data table with ID population quartiles is provided. TOLDXtm for ID showed a robust one factor structure and coherentassociations with other, related neuropsychological instruments. Significant differences between IDMi and IDMo on movement-related variables like Correct (Corr; p = .002) and Moves (Mov; p = .042) were observed, along with good internal consistency values, Corr (\u03b1 = .75), Mov (\u03b1 = .52). Regarding internal consistency, no between-groups differences were observed (all p-value > 0.05). The TOLDXtm for ID is thus an instrument, supported by good validity evidence, to evaluate problem-solving and planning in ID. It distinguishes between individuals with mild and moderate ID, and is highly associated with other measures of executive functioning.", "To inform and guide the development of a future model of specialist and advanced nursing and midwifery practice.\nThere is a sizable body of empirical literature supporting the unique contributions of specialist and advanced practice roles to health care. However, there is very little international evidence to inform the integration of a future model for advanced or specialist practice in the Irish healthcare system.\nA qualitative study was conducted to initiate this important area of inquiry.\nPurposive sampling was used to generate a sample of informants (n\u00a0=\u00a015) for the interviews. Nurses and midwives working in specialist and advanced practice and participants from other areas such as legislative, regulatory, policy, medicine and education were included in the sampling frame.\nArguments for a new model of specialist and advanced practice were voiced. A number of participants proposed that flexibility within specialist and advanced practitioner career pathways was essential. Otherwise, there existed the possibility of being directed into specialised \"silos,\" precluding movement to another area of integrated practice. Future specialist and advanced practice education programmes need to include topics such as the development of emotional and political intelligence.\nThe contribution of specialist and advanced practice roles to the health service includes providing rapid access to care, seamless patient flow across services, early discharge and lead coordinator of the patient's care trajectory. There was a recommendation of moving towards a universal model to cultivate specialist and advanced nurse and midwife practitioners.\nThe model design has Universal application in a range of contexts \"U.\" It is Collaborative in its inclusivity of all key stakeholders \"C.\" The model is Dynamic pertinent to accommodating movement of nurses and midwives across health continua rather than plateauing in very specialised \"silos\" \"D.\"", "Patients with bipolar disorder often suffer from cognitive impairment that significantly influences their functional outcome. However, it remains unknown whether lithium has a central role in cognition and functional outcome. We examined whether cognition and functional outcome were predicted by demographic and clinical variables, including the response to lithium, in lithium-treated patients with bipolar disorder.\nWe evaluated 96 lithium-treated euthymic patients with bipolar disorder and 196 age- and-gender-matched healthy controls, using the Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia (BACS). The patients were also assessed using the Social Functioning Scale (SFS) and \"The Retrospective Criteria of Long-Term Treatment Response in Research Subjects with Bipolar Disorder\" (Alda) scale, which was evaluated as either a continuous measure of the total scale or a dichotomous criterion.\nMultiple regression analysis revealed two key findings: first, that the premorbid intelligence quotient, age, and number of mood episodes were predictors of the BACS composite score; and, second, that the BACS composite score, negative symptoms, and continuous measure on the total Alda scale (but not its dichotomy) predicted the total SFS score. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to confirm these findings, and additionally revealed that the Alda scale was significantly associated with negative symptoms and also the number of mood episodes, regardless of how it was evaluated.\nSEM delineated how demographic and clinical variables, cognitive performance, and response to lithium treatment were causally associated with, and converged on, social function. The putative role of the Alda scale for social function warrants further study.", "Individual differences across a variety of cognitive processes are functionally associated with individual differences in intrinsic networks such as the default mode network (DMN). The extent to which these networks correlate or anticorrelate has been associated with performance in a variety of circumstances. Despite the established role of the DMN in mind wandering processes, little research has investigated how large-scale brain networks at rest relate to mind wandering tendencies outside the laboratory. Here we examine the extent to which the DMN, along with the dorsal attention network (DAN) and frontoparietal control network (FPCN) correlate with the tendency to mind wander in daily life. Participants completed the Mind Wandering Questionnaire and a 5-min resting state fMRI scan. In addition, participants completed measures of executive function, fluid intelligence, and creativity. We observed significant positive correlations between trait mind wandering and 1) increased DMN connectivity at rest and 2) increased connectivity between the DMN and FPCN at rest. Lastly, we found significant positive correlations between trait mind wandering and fluid intelligence (Ravens) and creativity (Remote Associates Task). We interpret these findings within the context of current theories of mind wandering and executive function and discuss the possibility that certain instances of mind wandering may not be inherently harmful. Due to the controversial nature of global signal regression (GSReg) in functional connectivity analyses, we performed our analyses with and without GSReg and contrast the results from each set of analyses.", "Individual differences in the speed of information processing have been hypothesized to give rise to individual differences in general intelligence. Consistent with this hypothesis, reaction times (RTs) and latencies of event-related potential have been shown to be moderately associated with intelligence. These associations have been explained either in terms of individual differences in some brain-wide property such as myelination, the speed of neural oscillations, or white-matter tract integrity, or in terms of individual differences in specific processes such as the signal-to-noise ratio in evidence accumulation, executive control, or the cholinergic system. Here we show in a sample of 122 participants, who completed a battery of RT tasks at 2 laboratory sessions while an EEG was recorded, that more intelligent individuals have a higher speed of higher-order information processing that explains about 80% of the variance in general intelligence. Our results do not support the notion that individuals with higher levels of general intelligence show advantages in some brain-wide property. Instead, they suggest that more intelligent individuals benefit from a more efficient transmission of information from frontal attention and working memory processes to temporal-parietal processes of memory storage. (PsycINFO Database Record", "Prematurity has been shown to be associated with an increased risk of intellectual disability (ID).\nThe aim was to establish whether the prevalence of ID, defined as significant limitations in both intellectual (intelligence quotient below 70) and adaptive functioning among moderately preterm (MP; 32+0 -33+6 \u00a0weeks) and late preterm (LP; 34+0 -36+6 \u00a0weeks) infants, is increased compared with that in term infants (\u226537+0 \u00a0weeks). Antenatal and neonatal risk factors for ID among gestational age groups were sought. The national register study included all live-born infants in Finland in 1991-2008, excluding those who died before one year age, or had any major congenital anomaly or missing data. A total of 1\u00a0018\u00a0256 infants (98.0%) were analysed: very preterm (VP; <32+0 \u00a0weeks, n\u00a0=\u00a06329), MP (n\u00a0=\u00a06796), LP (n\u00a0=\u00a039\u00a0928) and term (n\u00a0=\u00a0965\u00a0203).\nBy the age of seven years, the prevalence of ID was 2.48% in the VP group, 0.81% in the MP group, 0.55% in the LP group and 0.35% in the term group. Intracranial haemorrhage increased the ID risk in all groups. Male sex and born small for gestational age predicted an increased risk in all but the MP group.\nThe prevalence of ID decreased with increasing gestational age. Prevention of intracranial haemorrhages may have a beneficial effect on the neurodevelopmental outcomes of neonates.", "To study neurocognitive functions and behavior in children with a history of fetal growth restriction (FGR) with brain sparing. We hypothesized that children with FGR would have poorer outcomes on these domains.\nSubjects were 12-year-old children with a history of FGR born to mothers with severe early-onset hypertensive pregnancy disorders (n\u2009=\u200996) compared with a normal functioning full term comparison group with a birth weight \u22652500 g (n\u2009=\u200932). Outcome measures were neurocognitive outcomes (ie, intelligence quotient, executive function, attention) and behavior.\nFor the FGR group, the mean ratio of the pulsatility index for the umbilical artery/middle cerebral artery (UC-ratio\u2009=\u2009severity of brain sparing) was 1.42\u2009\u00b1\u20090.69. The mean gestational age was 31-6/7 \u2009\u00b1\u20092-2/7 weeks. The mean birth weight was 1341 \u2009\u00b1\u2009454 g, and the mean birth weight ratio 0.68\u2009\u00b1\u20090.12.

UC-ratio was not associated with any of the outcomes, but low parental education and lower birth weight ratio were.\nIn this prospective follow-up study of 12-year-old children with a history of FGR and confirmed brain sparing, neurocognitive functions were comparable with the comparison group, but parent-reported social and attention problem scores were increased.", "Arsenic is a rare crystal element that naturally occurs in all environmental media. A combination of regional and site-specific biogeochemical and hydrological factors governs its dispersion in the environment. It has far reaching consequences on human health. Exposure to arsenic in drinking water has been associated with a decline in intellectual function in children.\nThe aim of this study is to assess the relationship between exposure to arsenic by drinking water and children's intelligence in Karnataka state, India.\nTwenty school children of age 10-14 years from Sandur, Bellary, Karnataka, and from Hutti, Raichur, Karnataka, were categorized as control and study group, respectively.\nWater samples were collected from both the villages for the analysis of arsenic and fluoride levels. Hair and nail samples were collected from the participants, and the arsenic levels were determined. Intelligence quotient (IQ) assessment was done using the Raven's Standard Progressive Matrices.\nChi-square test, Mann-Whitney U-test, and Fisher's exact test. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.\nThere was a significant increase in the arsenic content in the hair and nail samples of children in the study group. The mean IQ tests score in the control group and study group was 30.55 and 17.95, respectively, and this difference was statistically significant.\nChronic arsenic exposure could be a possible cause for the reduced IQ scores seen in children residing in Hutti, Raichur District, North Karnataka.", "The use of geoforensic analysis in criminal investigations is continuing to develop, with the diversification of analytical techniques, many of which are semi-automated, facilitating prompt analysis of large sample sets at a relatively low cost. Whilst micro-scale geoforensic analysis has been shown to assist criminal investigations including homicide (Concheri et al., 2011 [1]), wildlife crime (Morgan et al., 2006 [2]), illicit drug distribution (Stanley, 1992 [3]), and burglary (Mildenhall, 2006 [4]), its application to the pressing international security threat posed by Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) is yet to be considered. This experimental study simulated an IED supply chain from the sourcing of raw materials through to device emplacement. Mineralogy, quartz grain surface texture analysis (QGSTA) and particle size analysis (PSA) were used to assess whether environmental materials were transferred and subsequently persisted on the different components of three pressure plate IEDs. The research also addressed whether these samples were comprised of material from single or multiple geographical provenances that represented supply chain activity nodes. The simulation demonstrated that material derived from multiple activity nodes, was transferred and persisted on device components. The results from the mineralogy and QGSTA illustrated the value these techniques offer for the analysis of mixed provenance samples. The results from the PSA, which produces a bulk signature of the sample, failed to distinguish multiple provenances. The study also considered how the environmental material recovered could be used to generate information regarding the geographical locations the device had been in contact with, in an intelligence style investigation, and demonstrated that geoforensic analysis has the potential to be of value to international counter-IED efforts. It is a tool that may be used to prevent the distribution of large quantities of devices, by aiding the identification of the geographical location of key activity nodes.", "To determine the predictors of cognitive function in patients with drug-resistant gelastic seizures (GS) related to hypothalamic hamartoma (HH) before and after stereotactic radiofrequency thermocoagulation surgery (SRT).\nWe studied 88 patients with HH who underwent SRT between October 1997 and December 2014. Patients received neuropsychological tests preoperatively and postoperatively. Based on the preoperative measures, patients were categorized as \"high-functioning\" (full-scale intelligence quotient [FSIQ] \u226570; n = 48) and \"low-functioning\" group (FSIQ <70; n = 40). Univariate and multivariate linear regression analyses determined the clinical, electroencephalography (EEG), and imaging factors associated with preoperative cognitive function as well as postoperative cognitive change.\nEighty-seven patients (98.8%) were followed postoperatively for an average of 3.3 years, and 75 (85.2%) of them achieved GS remission at the last hospital visit. Neuropsychological performance was significantly improved after surgery in both groups. Multivariate linear regression analysis showed that a smaller HH size (p = 0.002) and a smaller number of antiepileptic drugs (p < 0.001) were preoperatively associated with better neuropsychological performance. Multivariate linear regression analysis showed that better postoperative improvement in cognition was associated with a shorter duration of epilepsy (p = 0.03).\nCognitive impairment related to epileptic encephalopathy may improve following SRT in substantial proportions of HH patients. Reduced improvement in postoperative cognitive function in patients with longer duration of epilepsy warrants further studies to determine if earlier SRT provides a greater chance of postoperative cognitive improvement in patients with HH.", "To investigate the association between white matter organization in the neonatal brain and cognitive capacities at early school age in children born very preterm.\nThirty children born very preterm (gestational age median 27.5wks, interquartile range [IQR] 25.5-29.5; 18 males, 12 females) were included in this retrospective observational cohort study. Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) had been performed on a 3T system in the neonatal period (median 41.3 [IQR 40.0-42.6]wks) and cognitive functioning was formally assessed at age 5 years and 7 months (IQR 5.4-5.9y) using the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence. Structural connectivity maps were reconstructed from the DWI data using deterministic streamline tractography. Network metrics of global and local communication and mean fractional anisotropy of white matter pathways were related to IQ and processing speed at age 5 years using linear regression analyses.\nMean fractional anisotropy was significantly related to Performance IQ at age 5 years (F=8.48, p=0.007). Findings persisted after adjustment for maternal education level.\nOur findings provide evidence that the blueprint of later cognitive achievement is already present at term-equivalent age and suggest that white matter connectivity strength may be a valuable predictor for long-term cognitive functioning.", "The autism spectrum (AS) is a multifaceted neurodevelopmental variant associated with lifelong challenges. Despite the relevant importance of identifying AS in adults for epidemiological, public health, and quality of life issues, the measurement properties of the tools currently used to screen and diagnose adults without intellectual disabilities (ID) have not been assessed.\nThis systematic review addresses the accuracy, reliability, and validity of the reported AS screening and diagnostic tools used in adults without ID.\nElectronic databases and bibliographies were searched, and identified papers evaluated against inclusion criteria. The PRISMA statement was used for reporting the review. We evaluated the quality of the papers using the COSMIN Checklist for psychometric data, and QUADAS-2 for diagnostic data. For the COSMIN assessment, evidence was considered to be strong when several methodologically good articles, or one excellent article, reported consistent evidence for or against a measurement property. For the QUADAS ratings, evidence was considered to be \"satisfactory\" if at least one study was rated with a low risk of bias and low concern about applicability.\nWe included 38 articles comprising 32 studies, five reviews, and one book chapter and assessed nine tools (three diagnostic and six screening, including eight of their short versions). Among screening tools, only AQ-50, AQ-S, and RAADS-R and RAADS-14 were found to provide satisfactory or intermediate values for their psychometric properties, supported by strong or moderate evidence. Nevertheless, risks of bias and concerns on the applicability of these tools limit the evidence on their diagnostic properties. We found that none of the gold standard diagnostic tools used for children had satisfactory measurement properties.\nThere is limited evidence for the measurement properties of the screening and diagnostic tools used for AS adults with a mean normal range of measured intelligence. This may lessen the validity of conclusions and public health decisions on an important fraction of the adult autistic population. This not only justifies further validation studies of screening and diagnostic tools for autistic adults, but also supports the parallel use of self-reported information and clinical expertise with these instruments during the diagnostic process.", "This study sought to identify linkages between Mayer, Salovey, and Caruso's (2008) four dimensions of emotional intelligence (EI) and organizational citizenship behavior, and the moderating influence of locus of control. Using a sample of 290 employed students, the present study examines the effects of the dimensions of EI on OCB directed at individuals (OCB-I) and OCB directed at the organization (OCB-O). Emotionally intelligent individuals were hypothesized to engage in more organizational citizenship behavior (OCB) than individuals with lower EI. Work locus of control was hypothesized to moderate the emotional intelligence-OCB linkage, with high internals having a stronger emotional intelligence to OCB linkage. Results indicate that the EI dimensions of perceiving, understanding, and managing emotions had positive effects on OCB-I and OCB-O. Using emotions was not linked to OCB. Locus of control strengthened the EI to OCB-I link, but had no effect on the OCB-O linkage.", "Based on evolutionary theory, a recent model in affective neuroscience delineated six emotional brain systems at the core of human personality: SEEKING, CARING, PLAYFULNESS, FEAR, ANGER, SADNESS. The Affective Neuroscience Personality Scales (ANPS) assess their functioning. Using a person-centred approach of the ANPS, this study: (i) examined the existence of latent personality profiles, (ii) studied their gender invariance, (iii) assessed their longitudinal (4 years) stability, and (iv) explored how they relate to several intrapersonal, interpersonal, and emotion regulation skills. Latent Profile Analysis in 2 samples (Canadian, longitudinal, N\u2009=\u2009520; French, cross-sectional, N\u2009=\u2009830) found that, qualitatively, 3 profiles characterized both populations and genders, with one distinction for the second profile where the French women endorsed slightly higher and lower scores for, respectively, the negative and positive emotions. Whilst not being quantitatively similar across genders, the personality profiles remained consistent across time in the longitudinal sample. Associations between profiles and intrapersonal (e.g. depression), interpersonal (e.g. empathy), and emotion regulation skills measures (e.g. emotional intelligence) offered concurrent validity evidence. This person centred approach to ANPS offers a holistic and parsimonious way to study affective personality dimensions. It opens promising avenues for future studies on the predictive value of ANPS profiles, and for personality-targeted interventions.", "Health research in low- and middle- income countries (LMICs) is often driven by donor priorities rather than by the needs of the countries where the research takes place. This lack of alignment of donor's priorities with local research need may be one of the reasons why countries fail to achieve set goals for population health and nutrition. India has a high burden of morbidity and mortality in women, children and infants. In order to look forward toward the Sustainable Development Goals, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and the INCLEN Trust International (INCLEN) employed the Child Health and Nutrition Research Initiative's (CHNRI) research priority setting method for maternal, neonatal, child health and nutrition with the timeline of 2016-2025. The exercise was the largest to-date use of the CHNRI methodology, both in terms of participants and ideas generated and also expanded on the methodology.\nCHNRI is a crowdsourcing-based exercise that involves using the collective intelligence of a group of stakeholders, usually researchers, to generate and score research options against a set of criteria. This paper reports on a large umbrella CHNRI that was divided into four theme-specific CHNRIs (maternal, newborn, child health and nutrition). A National Steering Group oversaw the exercise and four theme-specific Research Sub-Committees technically supported finalizing the scoring criteria and refinement of research ideas for the respective thematic areas. The exercise engaged participants from 256 institutions across India - 4003 research ideas were generated from 498 experts which were consolidated into 373 research options (maternal health: 122; newborn health: 56; child health: 101; nutrition: 94); 893 experts scored these against five criteria (answerability, relevance, equity, innovation and out-of-box thinking, investment on research). Relative weights to the criteria were assigned by 79 members from the Larger Reference Group. Given India's diversity, priorities were identified at national and three regional levels: (i) the Empowered Action Group (EAG) and North-Eastern States; (ii) States and Union territories in Northern India (including West Bengal); and (iii) States and Union territories in Southern and Western parts of India.\nThe exercise leveraged the inherent flexibility of the CHNRI method in multiple ways. It expanded on the CHNRI methodology enabling analyses for identification of research priorities at national and regional levels. However, prioritization of research options are only valuable if they are put to use, and we hope that donors will take advantage of this prioritized list of research options.", "In this study, we developed new methods to calculate theoretical base rates of score differences when more than two test scores are involved in score comparisons. The study compares the results of theoretical and observed base rates, and then explores whether these methods can be used in practice.\nWe proposed the formulas and the Monte Carlo methods calculating theoretical base rates of score differences between a single test score and a mean of several test scores by overall sample and subsamples. We also compared observed and theoretical base rates of score differences in the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (5th ed.). using the normative sample data.\nThe theoretical base rates obtained from the new methods were close to the observed base rates.\nThe new methods can derive reasonable theoretical base rates and are usable practically.", "Nature-motivated pressure sensors have been greatly important components integrated into flexible electronics and applied in artificial intelligence. Here, we report a high sensitivity, ultrathin, and transparent pressure sensor based on wrinkled graphene prepared by a facile liquid-phase shrink method. Two pieces of wrinkled graphene are face to face assembled into a pressure sensor, in which a porous anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) membrane with the thickness of only 200 nm was used to insulate the two layers of graphene. The pressure sensor exhibits ultrahigh operating sensitivity (6.92 kPa-1), resulting from the insulation in its inactive state and conduction under compression. Formation of current pathways is attributed to the contact of graphene wrinkles through the pores of AAO membrane. In addition, the pressure sensor is also an on/off and energy saving device, due to the complete isolation between the two graphene layers when the sensor is not subjected to any pressure. We believe that our high-performance pressure sensor is an ideal candidate for integration in flexible electronics, but also paves the way for other 2D materials to be involved in the fabrication of pressure sensors.", "There are changes to the degree of cortical folding from gestation through adolescence into young adulthood. Recent evidence suggests that degree of cortical folding is linked to individual differences in general cognitive ability in healthy adults. However, it is not yet known whether age-related cortical folding changes are related to maturation of specific cognitive abilities in adolescence. To address this, we examined the relationship between frontoparietal cortical folding as measured by a Freesurfer-derived local gyrification index (lGI) and performance on subtests from the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence and scores from Conner's Continuous Performance Test-II in 241 healthy adolescents (ages 12-25 years). We hypothesized that age-related lGI changes in the frontoparietal cortex would contribute to cognitive development. A secondary goal was to explore if any gyrification-cognition relationships were either test-specific or sex-specific. Consistent with previous studies, our results showed a reduction of frontoparietal local gyrification with age. Also, as predicted, all cognitive test scores (i.e., Vocabulary, Matrix Reasoning, the CPT-II Commission, Omission, Variabiltiy, d') showed age\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0cognitive ability interaction effects in frontoparietal and temporoparietal brain regions. Mediation analyses confirmed a causal role of age-related cortical folding changes only for CPT-II Commission errors. Taken together, the results support the functional significance of cortical folding, as well as provide the first evidence that cortical folding maturational changes play a role in cognitive development.", "Following the adoption of the new international diagnosis classification from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-5), autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has been established as a dimensional category that includes other disorders that were previously considered as separate entities. Previous research has shown that some people with this disorder exhibit different communicative and linguistic profiles. Therefore, contradictory results could be found among people who receive the same diagnosis.\nTo distinguish structural language aspects (expression and comprehension), interactive aspects (pragmatics), and social adaptation between children with an ASD-level 1 of support and children with typical development.\nSeventeen children with Asperger syndrome (according to the DSM-IV-TR), and 20 children with typical development between 7 and 12 years old. We have equated diagnosis of Asperger syndrome with ASD-level 1 of support. We have evaluated intelligence quotient, communication, and social adaptation with direct and indirect standardized parental scales.\nWe have found significant differences in comprehension (p = 0.025), interaction (p = 0.001), and social adaptation (p = 0.001) between the two groups.\nSubjects with ASD-level 1 of support demonstrate an average intelligence quotient, and good expressive structure (syntax and semantic level), which may be different from other children who receive the same diagnosis, due to the wide heterogeneity of the disorder. Nevertheless, our subjects have problems related to comprehension of grammar structure, pragmatics, and social adaptation. These difficulties could be related to emotional and social problems.\nPerfil comunicativo y de adaptacion social en poblacion infantil con trastornos del espectro autista: nuevo enfoque a partir de los criterios del DSM-5.\nIntroduccion. Tras la nueva clasificacion diagnostica del Manual diagnostico y estadistico de los trastornos mentales, quinta edicion (DSM-5), el trastorno del espectro autista (TEA) ha pasado a considerarse una categoria dimensional que engloba una serie de trastornos que antes se consideraban como entidades diferentes. La bibliografia previa ha mostrado perfiles comunicativos y linguisticos diferentes en personas con estos trastornos, por lo que podrian encontrarse resultados contradictorios en los individuos que en la actualidad reciben un diagnostico de TEA. Objetivo. Identificar los aspectos del lenguaje estructural (expresion y comprension), interaccion (pragmatica) y adaptacion social diferenciales en ni\u00f1os con diagnostico de TEA de nivel 1 de apoyo y compararlos con ni\u00f1os con desarrollo tipico. Sujetos y metodos. Diecisiete ni\u00f1os con sindrome de Asperger (segun el DSM-IV-TR) y 20 ni\u00f1os con desarrollo tipico de entre 7 y 12 a\u00f1os. Se ha equiparado el sindrome de Asperger del DSM-IV-TR con el TEA con nivel 1 de apoyo del DSM-5. Se ha evaluado la inteligencia, la comunicacion y la adaptacion social con medidas directas estandarizadas y medidas indirectas paternas. Resultados. Se han encontrado diferencias significativas en comprension (comprension de estructuras gramaticales; p = 0,025), interaccion (cuestionario de capacidades y dificultades total; p = 0,001) y adaptacion social (Children's Communication Checklist-2 total; p = 0,001) entre los grupos. Conclusiones. Los participantes con TEA con nivel 1 muestran un nivel de inteligencia normal y buena expresividad estructural (sintaxis y semantica), lo que podria diferenciarlos sustancialmente, dada la gran heterogeneidad del trastorno, de otros ni\u00f1os que en la actualidad tambien reciben el diagnostico de TEA. No obstante, nuestros participantes tambien presentan problemas de comprension de estructuras gramaticales, interaccion pragmatica y adaptacion social. Estas dificultades podrian relacionarse con posibles problemas emocionales y de socializacion.", "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a spectrum disease of overwhelming complexity, the research of which generates enormous amounts of structured, semi-structured and unstructured data. This resulting big data has tremendous potential to be mined for valuable information regarding the \"most complex disease of the most complex organ\". Big data analyses require specialized big data analytics applications, machine learning and artificial intelligence platforms to reveal associations, trends, correlations and patterns not otherwise realized by current analytical approaches. The intersection of potential data sources between experimental TBI and clinical TBI research presents inherent challenges for setting parameters for the generation of common data elements and to mine existing legacy data that would allow highly translatable big data analyses. In order to successfully utilize big data analyses in TBI, we must be willing to accept the messiness of data, collect and store all data and give up causation for correlation. In this context, coupling the big data approach to established clinical and pre-clinical data sources will transform current practices for triage, diagnosis, treatment and prognosis into highly integrated evidence-based patient care.", "The high-ranking German Nazi Reinhard Heydrich (1904-1942) was one of the main organizers of the mass murder of Jews during the Second World War. He died on June 4, 1942, in Prague after having been wounded in Operation Anthropoid planned by the British intelligence services. Since the 1970s and 1980s, Heydrich's death has been frequently presented in British, American, and French literature as the consequence of a bacteriologic attack. Botulinum toxin would have been used in the grenades or ammunition. We discuss the botulinum toxin hypothesis using the now declassified British archives of Operation Anthropoid and of the chemical and bacteriologic warfare centers to assess this hypothesis.", "Cognitive functions are highly heritable and polygenic, though the source of this genetic influence is unclear. On the neurobiological level, these functions rely on effective neuroplasticity, in which the activity-regulated cytoskeleton associated protein (ARC) plays an essential role.\nTo examine whether the ARC gene complex may contribute to the genetic components of intellectual function given the crucial role of ARC in brain plasticity and memory formation.\nThe ARC complex was tested for association with intelligence (IQ) in children from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC, N\u200a=\u200a5,165). As Alzheimer's disease (AD) shares genetics with cognitive functioning, the association was followed up in an AD sample (17,008 cases, 37,154 controls).\nThe ARC complex revealed association with verbal and total IQ (empirical p\u200a=\u200a0.027 and 0.041, respectively) in the ALSPAC. The strongest single variant signal (rs2830077; empirical p\u200a=\u200a0.018), within the APP gene, was confirmed in the AD sample (p\u200a=\u200a2.76E-03). Functional analyses of this variant showed its preferential binding to the transcription factor CP2.\nThis study implicates APP in childhood IQ. While follow-up studies are needed, this observation could help elucidate the etiology of disorders associated with cognitive dysfunction, such as AD.", "A high prevalence of Developmental Language Disorder (DLD) is reported in the population of Young Offenders (YO). However, little is known about the extent of the association between language and offending behaviour relative to social disadvantage, education attendance and non-verbal intelligence (IQ), and neither has this association been investigated with particular reference to the expository discourse abilities of YOs on community orders in the UK.\nThis study aimed to examine the direction and strength of the association between language and offending behaviour by comparing the receptive and expressive language and expository discourse abilities of male and female YOs and non-offenders in the UK, relative to the confounds of social disadvantage, years of education attended and non-verbal IQ. Examining expository discourse provided a measure of the YOs. ability to verbally communicate complex information; a communication ability that is fundamental to engaging effectively in youth offending services and secondary education.\nAn opportunity sample of 52 YOs was recruited from a youth offending service. The YO group was matched on years of education, social disadvantage and non-verbal IQ to a purpose selected comparison group of 25 non-offenders. All participants had English as their first language and were not currently receiving any speech and language intervention. Participants completed standardised measures of receptive and expressive language and an expository discourse measure. The incidence of DLD was identified and compared across offender group using scores from the language and expository discourse measures and gender differences were also explored. Finally, logistical regression analysis was used to test the association between language performance and offending status relative to the confounds of social disadvantage, education attendance and non-verbal IQ.\nA large proportion of YOs scored below test norms for the language and expository discourse measures, which indicated a high incidence of DLD that was much larger than that displayed by the non-offenders. No differences were found on language performance between male and female YOs. Logistic regression analyses found that as language performance increased, the probability of being a non-offender significantly increased.\nParticipants were over 1 to 5 times more likely to be classified as a non-offender for every unit increase in the language and expository discourse scores. The statistically significant positive association found between language and offending behaviour relative to other confounds, highlights the important role of language in understanding offending behaviour. YOs displayed high incidences of DLD in their language and expository discourse abilities despite having not received any speech and language intervention prior to their involvement in this study. This has implications for their effective engagement in education and in youth offending and criminal justice services (CJS). Professionals in education, health and social care and youth justice should be made aware of the language needs of both YOs and children with emotional behavioural difficulties, and these language needs should be identified and targeted as early as possible to enable them to be effective communicators who can engage effectively in their provision.", "The factor structure of mental abilities has most often been depicted using a higher-order model. Under this model, general mental ability (g) is placed at the top of a pyramid, with \"loading\" arrows going from it to the other factors of intelligence, which in turn go to subtest scores. In contrast, under the bifactor model (also known as the nested factors/direct hierarchical model), each subtest score has its own direct loading on g; the non-g factors (e.g., the broad abilities) do not mediate the relationships of the subtest scores with g. Here we summarized past research that compared the fit of higher-order and bifactor models using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). We also analyzed additional archival datasets to compare the fit of the two models. Using a total database consisting of 31 test batteries, 58 datasets, and 1,712,509 test takers, we found stronger support for a bifactor model of g than for the traditional higher-order model. Across 166 comparisons, the bifactor model had median increases of 0.076 for the Comparative Fit Index (CFI), 0.083 for the Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI), and 0.078 for the Normed Fit Index (NFI) and decreases of 0.028 for the root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) and 1343 for the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). Consequently, researchers should consider using bifactor models when conducting CFAs. The bifactor model also makes the unique contributions of g and the broad abilities to subtest scores more salient to test users.", "Background and purpose - Recent advances in artificial intelligence (deep learning) have shown remarkable performance in classifying non-medical images, and the technology is believed to be the next technological revolution. So far it has never been applied in an orthopedic setting, and in this study we sought to determine the feasibility of using deep learning for skeletal radiographs. Methods - We extracted 256,000 wrist, hand, and ankle radiographs from Danderyd's Hospital and identified 4 classes: fracture, laterality, body part, and exam view. We then selected 5 openly available deep learning networks that were adapted for these images. The most accurate network was benchmarked against a gold standard for fractures. We furthermore compared the network's performance with 2 senior orthopedic surgeons who reviewed images at the same resolution as the network. Results - All networks exhibited an accuracy of at least 90% when identifying laterality, body part, and exam view. The final accuracy for fractures was estimated at 83% for the best performing network. The network performed similarly to senior orthopedic surgeons when presented with images at the same resolution as the network. The 2 reviewer Cohen's kappa under these conditions was 0.76. Interpretation - This study supports the use for orthopedic radiographs of artificial intelligence, which can perform at a human level. While current implementation lacks important features that surgeons require, e.g. risk of dislocation, classifications, measurements, and combining multiple exam views, these problems have technical solutions that are waiting to be implemented for orthopedics.", "We explore the hypothesis that many intuitive physical inferences are based on a mental physics engine that is analogous in many ways to the machine physics engines used in building interactive video games. We describe the key features of game physics engines and their parallels in human mental representation, focusing especially on the intuitive physics of young infants where the hypothesis helps to unify many classic and otherwise puzzling phenomena, and may provide the basis for a computational account of how the physical knowledge of infants develops. This hypothesis also explains several 'physics illusions', and helps to inform the development of artificial intelligence (AI) systems with more human-like common sense.", "Difficulties in emotion perception are commonly observed in autism spectrum disorder. However, it is unclear whether these difficulties can be attributed to a general problem of relating to emotional states, or whether they specifically concern the perception of others' expressions. This study addressed this question in the context of pain, a sensory and emotional state with strong social relevance. We investigated pain evaluation in self and others in 16 male individuals with autism spectrum disorder and 16 age- and gender-matched individuals without autism spectrum disorder. Both groups had at least average intelligence and comparable levels of alexithymia and pain catastrophizing. We assessed pain reactivity by administering suprathreshold electrical pain stimulation at four intensity levels. Pain evaluation in others was investigated using dynamic facial expressions of shoulder patients experiencing pain at the same four intensity levels. Participants with autism spectrum disorder evaluated their own pain as being more intense than the pain of others, showing an underestimation bias for others' pain at all intensity levels. Conversely, in the control group, self- and other evaluations of pain intensity were comparable and positively associated. Results indicate that emotion perception difficulties in autism spectrum disorder concern the evaluation of others' emotional expressions, with no evidence for atypical experience of own emotional states.", "Crohn's disease is a chronic pathology belonging to the group of inflammatory bowel diseases. Patients suffering from Crohn's disease must be supervised by a medical specialist for the rest of their lives; furthermore, each patient has its own characteristics and is affected by the disease in a different way, so health recommendations and treatments cannot be generalized and should be individualized for a specific patient. To achieve this personalization in a cost-effective way using technology, we propose a model based on different information flows: control, personalization, and monitoring. As a result of the model and to perform a functional validation, an architecture based on services and a prototype of the system has been defined. In this prototype, a set of different devices and technologies to monitor variables from patients and their environment has been integrated. Artificial intelligence algorithms are also included to reduce the workload related to the review and analysis of the information gathered. Due to the continuous and automated monitoring of the Crohn's patient, this proposal can help in the personalization of the Crohn's disease clinical process.", "Objective. To measure whether Emotional intelligence (EI) would minimize the negative association between autistic-like traits (ALT) and empathic behavior and enhance the positive association between ALT and psychological distress. Methods. Our sample population included 823 hospital pharmacists belonging to a district society, and 378 pharmacy students. Analyses were performed to examine relationships between scores on the Emotional Intelligence Scale (EQS), Autism-Spectrum Quotient (AQ), Jefferson Scale of Empathy (JSE), and General Health Questionnaire-12 (GHQ). Results. Complete answers were obtained from 373 pharmacists, and 341 students. EQS partially intervened the associations between AQ and JSE and between AQ and GHQ. Conclusion. EI partially intervened the relationships between ALT and empathy, and between ALT and mental health, both of which are necessary for optimal pharmaceutical practice.", ": The vast majority of medical errors occurring each year involve faulty communication. For this reason, it's essential that we identify skills that support accurate communication and information transfer as well as optimum patient-centered care, team function, and patient safety. Research in nursing and other disciplines has demonstrated that emotional intelligence abilities improve communication, support constructive conflict resolution, and improve individual and team performance. Although further studies are needed, these findings suggest emotional intelligence ability can positively affect patient safety.", "To present the Tomographic and Biomechanical Index (TBI), which combines Scheimpflugbased corneal tomography and biomechanics for enhancing ectasia detection.\nPatients from different continents were retrospectively studied. The normal group included 1 eye randomly selected from 480 patients with normal corneas and the keratoconus group included 1 eye randomly selected from 204 patients with keratoconus. There were two groups: 72 ectatic eyes with no surgery from 94 patients with very asymmetric ectasia (VAE-E group) and the fellow eyes of these patients with normal topography (VAE-NT group). Pentacam HR and Corvis ST (Oculus Optikger\u00e4te GmbH, Wetzlar, Germany) parameters were analyzed and combined using different artificial intelligence methods. The accuracies for detecting ectasia of the Belin/Ambr\u00f3sio Deviation (BAD-D) and Corvis Biomechanical Index (CBI) were compared to the TBI, considering the areas under receiver operating characteristic curves (AUROCs).\nThe random forest method with leave-one-out cross-validation (RF/LOOCV) provided the best artificial intelligence model. The AUROC for detecting ectasia (keratoconus, VAE-E, and VAE-NT groups) of the TBI was 0.996, which was statistically higher (DeLong et al., P < .001) than the BAD-D (0.956) and CBI (0.936). The TBI cut-off value of 0.79 provided 100% sensitivity for detecting clinical ectasia (keratoconus and VAE-E groups) with 100% specificity. The AUROCs for the TBI, BAD-D, and CBI were 0.985, 0.839, and 0.822 in the VAE-NT group (DeLong et al., P < .001). An optimized TBI cut-off value of 0.29 provided 90.4% sensitivity with 96% specificity in the VAE-NT group.\nThe TBI generated by the RF/LOOCV provided greater accuracy for detecting ectasia than other techniques. The TBI was sensitive for detecting subclinical (fruste) ectasia among eyes with normal topography in very asymmetric patients. The TBI may also confirm unilateral ectasia, potentially characterizing the inherent ectasia susceptibility of the cornea, which should be the subject of future studies. [J Refract Surg. 2017;33(7):434-443.].", "A child's intelligence quotient (IQ) is determined by both genetic and environmental factors that start from the prenatal period itself. There is a lack of data on the factors which influence IQ in Indian children; therefore, we conducted a multicenter questionnaire-based study to determine the environmental factors which influence IQ in Indian children.\nIn this cross-sectional observational study, we recruited 1065 schoolchildren between the age of 12 and 16 years from 2 government and 13 private schools in 5 towns, 6 cities, and 2 villages across India. All the children were administered a questionnaire consisting of various environmental factors such as parents' education, occupation, income, and the physical activity of the students. IQ scores were assessed using Ravens Standard Progressive Matrices. An approximate IQ score was calculated using the score on the Ravens test. IQ scores were divided into three groups: below normal IQ (0-79), normal IQ (80-119), and high IQ (above 120). The data were analyzed using SPSS software.\nIn this study, it was observed that the environmental factors such as place of residence, physical activity, family income, parental education, and occupation of the father had an impact on the IQ of the children. Children living in cities (P = 0.001), children having physical activity more than 5 h/weeks (P = 0.001), children with parents having a postgraduate or graduate level of education (P = 0.001), children whose father having a professional job (P = 0.001), and those with a higher family income (P = 0.001) were more likely to have high IQ.\nIn the present study, we found that various environmental factors such as place of residence, physical exercise, family income, parents' occupation and education influence the IQ of a child to a great extent. Hence, a child must be provided with an optimal environment to be able to develop to his/her full genetic potential.", "Physicians in everyday clinical practice are under pressure to innovate faster than ever because of the rapid, exponential growth in healthcare data. \"Big data\" refers to extremely large data sets that cannot be analyzed or interpreted using traditional data processing methods. In fact, big data itself is meaningless, but processing it offers the promise of unlocking novel insights and accelerating breakthroughs in medicine-which in turn has the potential to transform current clinical practice. Physicians can analyze big data, but at present it requires a large amount of time and sophisticated analytic tools such as supercomputers. However, the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) in the era of big data could assist physicians in shortening processing times and improving the quality of patient care in clinical practice. This editorial provides a glimpse at the potential uses of AI technology in clinical practice and considers the possibility of AI replacing physicians, perhaps altogether. Physicians diagnose diseases based on personal medical histories, individual biomarkers, simple scores (e.g., CURB-65, MELD), and their physical examinations of individual patients. In contrast, AI can diagnose diseases based on a complex algorithm using hundreds of biomarkers, imaging results from millions of patients, aggregated published clinical research from PubMed, and thousands of physician's notes from electronic health records (EHRs). While AI could assist physicians in many ways, it is unlikely to replace physicians in the foreseeable future. Let us look at the emerging uses of AI in medicine.", "Inspired by the recent success of scientific-discovery games for predicting protein tertiary and RNA secondary structures, we have developed an open software for coarse-grained RNA folding simulations, guided by human intuition. To determine the extent to which interactive simulations can accurately predict 3D RNA structures of increasing complexity and lengths (four RNAs with 22-47 nucleotides), an interactive experiment was conducted with 141 participants who had very little knowledge of nucleic acids systems and computer simulations, and had received only a brief description of the important forces stabilizing RNA structures. Their structures and full trajectories have been analyzed statistically and compared to standard replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations. Our analyses show that participants gain easily chemical intelligence to fold simple and nontrivial topologies, with little computer time, and this result opens the door for the use of human-guided simulations to RNA folding. Our experiment shows that interactive simulations have better chances of success when the user widely explores the conformational space. Interestingly, providing on-the-fly feedback of the root mean square deviation with respect to the experimental structure did not improve the quality of the proposed models.", "Cognitive dysfunction frequently occurs in aphasic patients and primarily compromises linguistic skills. However, patients suffering from severe aphasia show heterogeneous performance in basic cognition. Our aim was to characterize the cognitive profiles of patients with severe aphasia and to determine whether they also differ as to residual linguistic abilities. We examined 189 patients with severe aphasia with standard language tests and with the CoBaGA (Cognitive Test Battery for Global Aphasia), a battery of nonverbal tests that assesses a wide range of cognitive domains such as attention, executive functions, intelligence, memory, visual-auditory recognition, and visual-spatial abilities. Twenty patients were also followed longitudinally in order to assess their improvement in cognitive skills after speech therapy. Three different subgroups of patients with different types and severity of cognitive impairment were evidenced. Subgroups differed as to residual linguistic skills, in particular comprehension and reading-writing abilities. Attention, reasoning, and executive functions improved after language rehabilitation. This study highlights the importance of an extensive evaluation of cognitive functions in patients with severe aphasia.", "Emotional intelligence (EI) is a popular construct with concentrated areas of application in education and health contexts. There is a need for reliable and valid measurement of EI in young people, with brief yet sensitive measures of the construct preferable for use in time-limited settings. However, the proliferation of EI measures has often outpaced rigorous psychometric evaluation (Gignac, 2009 ). Using data from 849 adolescents (407 females, 422 males) aged 11 to 16\u00a0years (M age 13.4, SD = 1.2\u00a0years), this article systematically examines the structural and predictive properties of a frequently employed measure of adolescent trait EI-the Emotional Quotient Inventory Youth Version-Short Form (EQ-i:YV[S]); Bar-On & Parker, 2000 ). Although the intended multidimensional factor structure was recovered through confirmatory factor analysis, the statistical and conceptual coherency of the underlying model was inadequate. Using a multitrait-multimethod approach, the EQ-i:YV(S) was found to converge with other measures of EI; however, evidence for divergent validity (Big Five personality dimensions) was less robust. Predictive utility for adolescent mental health outcomes (depression, disruptive behavior) was also limited. Findings suggest that use of the EQ-i:YV(S) for predictive or evaluative purposes should be avoided until refinements to the scale are made.", "Metamemory monitoring, or the ability to introspect on the accuracy of one's memories, improves considerably during childhood, but the underlying neural changes and implications for intellectual development are largely unknown. The present study examined whether cortical changes in key brain areas hypothesized to support metacognition contribute to the development of metamemory monitoring from late childhood into early adolescence. Metamemory monitoring was assessed among 7- to 12-y-old children (n = 145) and adults (n = 31). Children returned for up to two additional assessments at 8 to 14 y of age (n = 120) and at 9 to 15 y of age (n = 107) (n = 347 longitudinal scans). Results showed that metamemory monitoring continues to improve from childhood into adolescence. More pronounced cortical thinning in the anterior insula and a greater increase in the thickness of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex over the three assessment points predicted these improvements. Thus, performance benefits are linked to the unique patterns of regional cortical change during development. Metamemory monitoring at the first time point predicted intelligence at the third time point and vice versa, suggesting parallel development of these abilities and their reciprocal influence. Together, these results provide insights into the neuroanatomical correlates supporting the development of the capacity to self-reflect, and highlight the role of this capacity for general intellectual development.", "Bipolar disorder (BD) is accompanied by a high number of comorbidities and associated with an overall increased mortality. Especially obesity, systemic inflammatory processes and cognitive deficits are highly prevalent and increase with the course of illness. Physical activity (PA) is associated with beneficial effects on somatic comorbidities such as obesity or cardiovascular disease in individuals without psychiatric disorder. Furthermore, PA might increase neurocognitive performance and reduce systemic inflammation.\nThe aim of the study was to investigate the association between PA and neurocognitive function in euthymic individuals suffering from BD.\n120 individuals with BD, euthymic at test time, completed the self-reported International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) assessing PA of the past seven days and were accordingly assigned to a specific activity category (low, moderate or vigorous). Furthermore, clinical parameters were gathered and cognitive tests analysing verbal-dependent intelligence, attention, executive functioning as well as memory were administered.\nFemale individuals in the vigorous PA group performed significantly higher in most of the cognitive domains compared to females with moderate or low PA. In males, we only found a significant difference in one test for attention between moderate/vigorous and the low activity group.\nDifferences between PA groups in cognitive performance in female individuals with BD were obvious in almost all cognitive domains. As cognitive deficits are strongly associated with a worse course of disease and outcome, PA might offer a concomitant therapy targeting not only somatic comorbidities such as obesity and cardiovascular disease, but also neurocognition.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, which can effectively analyze massive amounts of fault data and automatically provide accurate diagnosis results, have been widely applied to fault diagnosis of rotating machinery. Conventional AI methods are applied using features selected by a human operator, which are manually extracted based on diagnostic techniques and field expertise. However, developing robust features for each diagnostic purpose is often labour-intensive and time-consuming, and the features extracted for one specific task may be unsuitable for others. In this paper, a novel AI method based on a deep belief network (DBN) is proposed for the unsupervised fault diagnosis of a gear transmission chain, and the genetic algorithm is used to optimize the structural parameters of the network. Compared to the conventional AI methods, the proposed method can adaptively exploit robust features related to the faults by unsupervised feature learning, thus requires less prior knowledge about signal processing techniques and diagnostic expertise. Besides, it is more powerful at modelling complex structured data. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated using datasets from rolling bearings and gearbox. To show the superiority of the proposed method, its performance is compared with two well-known classifiers, i.e., back propagation neural network (BPNN) and support vector machine (SVM). The fault classification accuracies are 99.26% for rolling bearings and 100% for gearbox when using the proposed method, which are much higher than that of the other two methods.", "Disease staging involves the assessment of disease severity or progression and is used for treatment selection. In diabetic retinopathy, disease staging using a wide area is more desirable than that using a limited area. We investigated if deep learning artificial intelligence (AI) could be used to grade diabetic retinopathy and determine treatment and prognosis.\nThe retrospective study analyzed 9,939 posterior pole photographs of 2,740 patients with diabetes. Nonmydriatic 45\u00b0 field color fundus photographs were taken of four fields in each eye annually at Jichi Medical University between May 2011 and June 2015. A modified fully randomly initialized GoogLeNet deep learning neural network was trained on 95% of the photographs using manual modified Davis grading of three additional adjacent photographs. We graded 4,709 of the 9,939 posterior pole fundus photographs using real prognoses. In addition, 95% of the photographs were learned by the modified GoogLeNet. Main outcome measures were prevalence and bias-adjusted Fleiss' kappa (PABAK) of AI staging of the remaining 5% of the photographs.\nThe PABAK to modified Davis grading was 0.64 (accuracy, 81%; correct answer in 402 of 496 photographs). The PABAK to real prognosis grading was 0.37 (accuracy, 96%).\nWe propose a novel AI disease-staging system for grading diabetic retinopathy that involves a retinal area not typically visualized on fundoscopy and another AI that directly suggests treatments and determines prognoses.", "Neurocognitive impairments are frequently observed in schizophrenia and major depressive disorder (MDD). However, it remains unclear whether reported neurocognitive abnormalities could objectively identify an individual as having schizophrenia or MDD.\nThe current study included 220 first-episode patients with schizophrenia, 110 patients with MDD and 240 demographically matched healthy controls (HC). All participants performed the short version of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised in China; the immediate and delayed logical memory of the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised in China; and seven tests from the computerized Cambridge Neurocognitive Test Automated Battery to evaluate neurocognitive performance. The three-class AdaBoost tree-based ensemble algorithm was employed to identify neurocognitive endophenotypes that may distinguish between subjects in the categories of schizophrenia, depression and HC. Hierarchical cluster analysis was applied to further explore the neurocognitive patterns in each group.\nThe AdaBoost algorithm identified individual's diagnostic class with an average accuracy of 77.73% (80.81% for schizophrenia, 53.49% for depression and 86.21% for HC). The average area under ROC curve was 0.92 (0.96 in schizophrenia, 0.86 in depression and 0.92 in HC). Hierarchical cluster analysis revealed for MDD and schizophrenia, convergent altered neurocognition patterns related to shifting, sustained attention, planning, working memory and visual memory. Divergent neurocognition patterns for MDD and schizophrenia related to motor speed, general intelligence, perceptual sensitivity and reversal learning were identified.\nNeurocognitive abnormalities could predict whether the individual has schizophrenia, depression or neither with relatively high accuracy. Additionally, the neurocognitive features showed promise as endophenotypes for discriminating between schizophrenia and depression.", "Since 2009, when Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionisation Mass Spectrometry Imaging (MALDI MSI) was firstly reported for the molecular mapping of latent fingermarks, the range of information and operational capabilities have steadily increased. Pioneering work from our Fingermark Research Group exploited different modalities, including Profiling (MALDI MSP), tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) and Ion Mobility MS/MS; a number of methodologies were also developed to conquer a main challenge, namely profiling the suspect and their actions prior to or whilst committing the crime. Suspect profiling here is no longer based on behavioural science but complements this discipline and the investigations by detecting and visualising the molecular make-up of fingermarks onto the identifying ridges. This forensic opportunity provides the link between the biometric information (ridge detail) and the corpus delicti or intelligence on the circumstances of the crime. In 2013, a review was published covering the research work and developments of four years supported by the Home Office, UK, and the local regional Police with some insights (and comparison) into similar research being reported employing other mass spectrometric techniques. The present review is an extensive update on the MALDI MS based methods' achievements, limitations and work in progress in fingermark analysis; it also offers an outlook on further necessary research into this subject. The main highlights are the increased number of possible information retrievable around a suspect and the more extended compatibility of this technology. The latter has allowed MALDI MS based methods to integrate well with current forensic fingerprinting, leading to the investigation of real police casework.", "Success at school determines future career opportunities. We described a time-of-day specific disparity in school performance between early and late chronotypes. Several studies showed that students with a late chronotype and short sleep duration obtain lower grades, suggesting that early school starting times handicap their performance. How chronotype, sleep duration, and time of day impact school performance is not clear. At a Dutch high school, we collected 40,890 grades obtained in a variety of school subjects over an entire school year. We found that the strength of the effect of chronotype on grades was similar to that of absenteeism, and that late chronotypes were more often absent. The difference in grades between the earliest 20% and the latest 20% of chronotypes corresponds to a drop from the 55th to 43rd percentile of grades. In academic subjects using mainly fluid cognition (scientific subjects), the correlation with grades and chronotype was significant while subjects relying on crystallised intelligence (humanistic/linguistic) showed no correlation with chronotype. Based on these and previous results, we can expand our earlier findings concerning exam times: students with a late chronotype are at a disadvantage in exams on scientific subjects, and when they are examined early in the day.", "Impairment in social functioning has been widely described in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). However, several aspects of social cognition, such as theory of mind (ToM), have not been substantially investigated in this context. This study examined cognitive and affective ToM in 40 OCD patients and 38 age-, sex-, and education-matched healthy controls (HCs) with the computerized Yoni task and a battery of neurocognitive tests. OCD symptom severity was assessed with the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS). Depressive and anxiety symptoms were also assessed. Compared to HCs, OCD patients performed worse on second-order affective condition trials, but not cognitive or physical condition trials, of the Yoni task; there were not group differences in any of the first-order condition domains. Second-order ToM performance of OCD patients was associated with estimated intelligence and working memory performance. After controlling for neurocognitive variables, the group difference in second-order affective condition performance remained significant. These findings indicate that the affective component of ToM may be selectively impaired in OCD patients and that the observed deficit is largely independent of other neurocognitive impairments and clinical characteristics.", "Emotional intelligence (EI) is a field of study that is receiving increasingly attention in the literature, due to its relevance to a series of aspects of human psychological and social functioning.\nThis study used archival data from an Italian sample encompassing 885 nonclinical adults, to contribute to the study of the validity and reliability of the Trait Meta Mood-Scale (TMMS), a widely used measure of self-perceived EI.\nStatistical analyses focused on internal consistency, factor structure and concurrent validity of an Italian TMMS version.\nResults confirmed previous international studies supporting the cross-cultural adaptability of the TMMS, showing adequate reliability and validity indexes for all TMMS scores.\nEI may be measured via self-report. Its relationship to psychopathology, however, deserves more research, as certain components of EI correlate positively with psychological suffering.", "Theory of mind (ToM) is an important social cognitive ability that has been investigated in BPD, with inconsistent findings indicating impaired, comparable, and enhanced ToM in BPD. This study aimed to clarify and extend previous findings by investigating affective and cognitive ToM abilities in youth early in the course of BPD, by including a clinical comparison group of youth with major depressive disorder (MDD).\nFemale participants aged 15-24 years diagnosed with BPD (n = 41) or MDD (n = 37) completed the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET) and Happ\u00e9's Cartoon Task, measures of affective and cognitive dimensions of ToM, respectively.\nThe BPD group performed significantly worse than the MDD group on the affective ToM task, even after controlling for age, intelligence and depressive symptoms. Results for cognitive ToM were not significantly different.\nFinding of poorer performance on a measure of affective ToM, in BPD youth, relative to youth with MDD early in the course of BPD suggest a developmental failure of sociocognitive abilities needed for mentalising and which are theorised as giving rise to core features of BPD. Future research should employ more naturalistic paradigms to study social cognition and should assess individuals even earlier in the course of BPD.", "The conventional methods to assess human gait are either expensive or complex to be applied regularly in clinical practice. To reduce the cost and simplify the evaluation, inertial sensors and adaptive algorithms have been utilized, respectively. This paper aims to summarize studies that applied adaptive also called artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to gait analysis based on inertial sensor data, verifying if they can support the clinical evaluation. Articles were identified through searches of the main databases, which were encompassed from 1968 to October 2016. We have identified 22 studies that met the inclusion criteria. The included papers were analyzed due to their data acquisition and processing methods with specific questionnaires. Concerning the data acquisition, the mean score is 6.1\u00b11.62, what implies that 13 of 22 papers failed to report relevant outcomes. The quality assessment of AI algorithms presents an above-average rating (8.2\u00b11.84). Therefore, AI algorithms seem to be able to support gait analysis based on inertial sensor data. Further research, however, is necessary to enhance and standardize the application in patients, since most of the studies used distinct methods to evaluate healthy subjects.", "Objectives\u00a0To examine the association between intelligence measured in childhood and leading causes of death in men and women over the life course.Design\u00a0Prospective cohort study based on a whole population of participants born in Scotland in 1936 and linked to mortality data across 68 years of follow-up.Setting\u00a0Scotland.Participants\u00a033\u2009536 men and 32\u2009229 women who were participants in the Scottish Mental Survey of 1947 (SMS1947) and who could be linked to cause of death data up to December 2015.Main outcome measures\u00a0Cause specific mortality, including from coronary heart disease, stroke, specific cancer types, respiratory disease, digestive disease, external causes, and dementia.Results\u00a0Childhood intelligence was inversely associated with all major causes of death. The age and sex adjusted hazard ratios (and 95% confidence intervals) per 1 SD (about 15 points) advantage in intelligence test score were strongest for respiratory disease (0.72, 0.70 to 0.74), coronary heart disease (0.75, 0.73 to 0.77), and stroke (0.76, 0.73 to 0.79). Other notable associations (all P<0.001) were observed for deaths from injury (0.81, 0.75 to 0.86), smoking related cancers (0.82, 0.80 to 0.84), digestive disease (0.82, 0.79 to 0.86), and dementia (0.84, 0.78 to 0.90). Weak associations were apparent for suicide (0.87, 0.74 to 1.02) and deaths from cancer not related to smoking (0.96, 0.93 to 1.00), and their confidence intervals included unity. There was a suggestion that childhood intelligence was somewhat more strongly related to coronary heart disease, smoking related cancers, respiratory disease, and dementia in women than men (P value for interactions <0.001, 0.02, <0.001, and 0.02, respectively).Childhood intelligence was related to selected cancer presentations, including lung (0.75, 0.72 to 0.77), stomach (0.77, 0.69 to 0.85), bladder (0.81, 0.71 to 0.91), oesophageal (0.85, 0.78 to 0.94), liver (0.85, 0.74 to 0.97), colorectal (0.89, 0.83 to 0.95), and haematopoietic (0.91, 0.83 to 0.98). Sensitivity analyses on a representative subsample of the cohort observed only small attenuation of the estimated effect of intelligence (by 10-26%) after adjustment for potential confounders, including three indicators of childhood socioeconomic status. In a replication sample from Scotland, in a similar birth year cohort and follow-up period, smoking and adult socioeconomic status partially attenuated (by 16-58%) the association of intelligence with outcome rates.Conclusions\u00a0In a whole national population year of birth cohort followed over the life course from age 11 to age 79, higher scores on a well validated childhood intelligence test were associated with lower risk of mortality ascribed to coronary heart disease and stroke, cancers related to smoking (particularly lung and stomach), respiratory diseases, digestive diseases, injury, and dementia.", "Prenatal bisphenol A (BPA) exposure has been associated with adverse neurodevelopment in epidemiological studies. However, prior studies had limited statistical power to examine sex-specific effects, and few examined child cognition.\nWe estimated the association between prenatal BPA exposure and child neurobehavior at 3 y of age in a prospective cohort of 812 mothers and their children.\nWe measured BPA concentration in urine samples collected at \u223c12 wk gestation among women enrolled in a 10-city Canadian cohort study. At approximately 3 y of age, we assessed children\u2019s cognitive abilities with the Wechsler Primary and Preschool Scale of IntelligenceTM\u2013III (WPPSI-III) and two scales of the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function\u2013Preschool (BRIEF-P). Parents reported children\u2019s behavior using the Behavior Assessment System for Children\u20132 (BASC-2) and the Social Responsiveness ScaleTM\u20132 (SRS-2). We estimated covariate-adjusted differences in neurobehavioral outcomes with a doubling in BPA concentration and sex-specific associations.\nBPA was not associated with WPPSI-III scores; child sex did not modify these associations. The association between BPA and BRIEF-P scores was modified by child sex (BPA\u00d7sex\u2002p-values\u22640.03). For example, a doubling of BPA concentration was associated with 1-point (95% CI: 0.3, 1.7) poorer working memory in boys and 0.5-point (95% CI: \u22121.1, 0.1) better scores in girls. BPA was not associated with most BASC-2 scales; however, it was associated with more internalizing and somatizing behaviors in boys, but not in girls (BPA\u00d7sex p&-values\u22640.08). A doubling of BPA concentration was associated with poorer SRS-2 scores [\u03b2=0.3 ( 95% CI: 0, 0.7)]; this association was not modified by sex.\nPrenatal urinary BPA concentration was associated with some aspects of child behavior in this cohort, and some associations were stronger among boys. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP984.", "Although recent developmental studies exploring the predictive power of intelligence and working memory (WM) for educational achievement in children have provided evidence for the importance of both variables, findings concerning the relative impact of IQ and WM on achievement have been inconsistent. Whereas IQ has been identified as the major predictor variable in a few studies, results from several other developmental investigations suggest that WM may be the stronger predictor of academic achievement. In the present study, data from the Munich Longitudinal Study on the Genesis of Individual Competencies (LOGIC) were used to explore this issue further. The secondary data analysis included data from about 200 participants whose IQ and WM was first assessed at the age of six and repeatedly measured until the ages of 18 and 23. Measures of reading, spelling, and math were also repeatedly assessed for this age range. Both regression analyses based on observed variables and latent variable structural equation modeling (SEM) were carried out to explore whether the predictive power of IQ and WM would differ as a function of time point of measurement (i.e., early vs. late assessment). As a main result of various regression analyses, IQ and WM turned out to be reliable predictors of academic achievement, both in early and later developmental stages, when previous domain knowledge was not included as additional predictor. The latter variable accounted for most of the variance in more comprehensive regression models, reducing the impact of both IQ and WM considerably. Findings from SEM analyses basically confirmed this outcome, indicating IQ impacts on educational achievement in the early phase, and illustrating the strong additional impact of previous domain knowledge on achievement at later stages of development.", "Dyslexia also known as specific reading disorder is a complex heritable disorder with unexpected difficulty in learning to read and spell despite adequate intelligence, education, environment, and normal senses. Over past decades, researchers have attempted to characterize dyslexia neurobiological and genetic levels and unfold its pathophysiology. The genetic research on dyslexia has received attention in Asia from the last decade. Though limited by different constraints the studies from Asia have been able to gather significant evidence in this field. We present a review of studies of genetics in Asian population and suggest future directions.", "In question answering (QA) system development, question classification is crucial for identifying information needs and improving the accuracy of returned answers. Although the questions are domain-specific, they are asked by non-professionals, making the question classification task more challenging.\nThis study aimed to classify health care-related questions posted by the general public (Chinese speakers) on the Internet.\nA topic-based classification schema for health-related questions was built by manually annotating randomly selected questions. The Kappa statistic was used to measure the interrater reliability of multiple annotation results. Using the above corpus, we developed a machine-learning method to automatically classify these questions into one of the following six classes: Condition Management, Healthy Lifestyle, Diagnosis, Health Provider Choice, Treatment, and Epidemiology.\nThe consumer health question schema was developed with a four-hierarchical-level of specificity, comprising 48 quaternary categories and 35 annotation rules. The 2000 sample questions were coded with 2000 major codes and 607 minor codes. Using natural language processing techniques, we expressed the Chinese questions as a set of lexical, grammatical, and semantic features. Furthermore, the effective features were selected to improve the question classification performance. From the 6-category classification results, we achieved an average precision of 91.41%, recall of 89.62%, and F1 score of 90.24%.\nIn this study, we developed an automatic method to classify questions related to Chinese health care posted by the general public. It enables Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents to understand Internet users' information needs on health care.", "This study investigated Emotional Intelligence (EI) as a moderator for the association between emotional expression and adaptive trauma processing, as measured by depressive symptoms. Using Pennebaker's written emotional expression paradigm, 105 participants were assigned to either a conventional trauma-writing or religious trauma-writing condition. Depressive symptoms were assessed at baseline and again at one-month post writing. No significant association between EI and religiousness was found at baseline. Results indicated a three-way interaction among EI, trauma severity, and writing condition on depressive symptoms at follow-up. For the religious trauma-writing condition only, there was a significant difference between high- versus low-EI participants who experienced more severe trauma in depressive symptoms at follow-up, such that low-EI participants registered less depressive symptoms than high-EI participants; while there was no significant difference between low versus high EI for participants with less severe trauma. These findings encourage further investigation of the conditions under which religion may be a beneficial factor in trauma adaptation.", "Learn how the Ministry of Public Health (MSP, the Spanish acronym) of Ecuador uses health technology assessment (HTA) in decision-making on the purchase of drugs that are not on the National List of Essential Medicines (NLEM).\nInformation from databases of the Health Intelligence Directorate (DIS, the Spanish acronym) and the National Directorate of Drugs and Medical Devices (DNMDM, the Spanish acronym), was used to compare decisions made by both entities, to learn about the use and consistency of HTA reports in decisions on purchasing drugs not included in the NLEM.\nFrom 2012 to 2015, 227 reports were issued, of which 87 cover drugs; 36, devices; 29: medical procedures; 34: health programs; and 41: other medical technologies. The DNMDM requested 59 of the reports on drugs. There was 80% agreement in decisions made by the two directorates that participate in the process.\nThe MSP, through the DIS, began using HTA in 2012. Given that the majority of reports evaluate drugs, it is essential that reports be prepared for other types of medical technologies and that they be prepared and used as widely as possible. Despite a high level of agreement in decisions, it is important to continue to improve the reports' scope and quality, and to monitor adoption and dissemination of authorized and funded technologies to learn the effectiveness and impact of HTA in Ecuador.\nConocer el uso de la evaluaci\u00f3n de tecnolog\u00edas sanitarias (ETS) en la toma de decisiones del Ministerio de Salud P\u00fablica (MSP) del Ecuador para la compra de medicamentos que no se encuentran en el Cuadro Nacional de Medicamentos B\u00e1sicos (CNMB).\nCon la informaci\u00f3n de las bases de datos de la Direcci\u00f3n de Inteligencia de la Salud (DIS) y la Direcci\u00f3n Nacional de Medicamentos y Dispositivos M\u00e9dicos (DNMDM), se compararon las decisiones tomadas por ambas instancias, para conocer el uso y la congruencia de los informes de ETS en las decisiones de compra de los medicamentos no incluidos en el CNMB.\nEntre 2012 y 2015, se han elaborado 227 informes, de los cuales 87 corresponden a medicamentos, 36 a dispositivos, 29 a procedimientos m\u00e9dicos, 34 a programas sanitarios, y 41 a otras tecnolog\u00edas m\u00e9dicas.

Inclusion criteria were checked in a first session. The CANTAB and additional pencil-and-paper tests were administered within 1 week. The participants (aged 69-96\u00a0years) were 137 Portuguese adults without neuropsychiatric diagnoses and 37 adults with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease dementia. Comparisons were made between the CANTAB tests and between these tests and the Rey Complex Figure Test (RCFT), Verbal Fluency (VF) test, and some Wechsler Memory Scale-III and Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-III subtests. Most intra-test correlations were stronger than the CANTAB inter-test correlations. The RVP correlated more with VF animals (.44), the PAL with RCFT immediate recall (-.52), the RTI with RVP mean latency (.42), and the SWM with Spatial Span backward (-.39).", "Mucopolysaccharidosis type II (MPS II - Hunter syndrome) is an X-linked lysosomal storage disorder caused by a deficiency in the enzyme iduronate-2 sulfatase (I2S), leading to the accumulation of the glycosaminoglycans, affecting multiple organs and systems. Enzyme replacement therapy does not cross the blood brain barrier, limiting results in neurological forms of the disease. Another option of treatment for severe MPS, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) has become the treatment of choice for the severe form of MPS type I, since it can preserve neurocognition when performed early in the course of the disease. To date, only few studies have examined the long-term outcomes of HSCT in patients with MPS II. We describe the seven-year follow-up of a prenatally diagnosed MPS II boy with positive family history of severe MPS form, submitted to HSCT with umbilical cord blood cells at 70\u00a0days of age. Engraftment after 30\u00a0days revealed mixed chimerism with 79% donor cells; after 7\u00a0years engraftment remains at 80%. I2S activity 30\u00a0days post-transplant was low in plasma and normal in leukocytes and the same pattern is observed to date. At age 7\u00a0years growth charts are normal and he is very healthy, although mild signs of dysostosis multiplex are present, as well as hearing loss. The neuropsychological evaluation (Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children - Fourth Edition - WISC-IV), disclosed an IQ of 47. Despite this low measured IQ, the patient continues to show improvements in cognitive, language and motor skills, being quite functional. We believe that HSCT is a therapeutic option for MPS II patients with the severe phenotype, as it could preserve neurocognition or even halt neurodegeneration, provided strict selection criteria are followed.", "Taking selfies is now becoming a standard human habit. However, as a social phenomenon, research is still in the fledgling stage and the scientific framework is sparse. Selfies allow us to share social information with others in a compact format. Furthermore, we are able to control important photographic and compositional aspects, such as perspective, which have a strong impact on the assessment of a face (e.g., demonstrated by the height-weight illusion, effects of gaze direction, faceism-index). In Study 1, we focused on the impact of perspective (left/right hemiface, above/below vs. frontal presentation) on higher cognitive variables and let 172 participants rate the perceived attractiveness, helpfulness, sympathy, dominance, distinctiveness, and intelligence, plus important information on health issues (e.g., body weight), on the basis of 14 3D faces. We could show that lateral snapshots yielded higher ratings for attractiveness compared to the classical frontal view. However, this effect was more pronounced for left hemifaces and especially female faces. Compared to the frontal condition, 30\u00b0 right hemifaces were rated as more helpful, but only for female faces while faces viewed from above were perceived as significant less helpful. Direct comparison between left vs. right hemifaces revealed no effect. Relating to sympathy, we only found a significant effect for 30\u00b0 right male hemifaces, but only in comparison to the frontal condition. Furthermore, female 30\u00b0 right hemifaces were perceived as more intelligent. Relating to body weight, we replicated the so-called \"height-weight illusion.\" Other variables remained unaffected. In Study 2, we investigated the impact of a typical selfie-style condition by presenting the respective faces from a lateral (left/right) and tilted (lower/higher) vantage point. Most importantly, depending on what persons wish to express with a selfie, a systematic change of perspective can strongly optimize their message; e.g., increasing their attractiveness by shooting from above left, and in contrast, decreasing their expressed helpfulness by shooting from below. We could further extent past findings relating to the height-weight illusion and showed that an additional rotation of the camera positively affected the perception of body weight (lower body weight). We discuss potential explanations for perspective-related effects, especially gender-related ones.", "The aim of this paper is to provide a parsimonious account of developmental and individual differences in intelligence (measured as g). The paper proposes a Differential-Developmental Model (DDM), which focuses on factors common to intelligence and cognitive development (e.g., mental speed and attention lapses). It also proposes a complementary method based on Jensen's box, a chronometric device. The device systematically varies task complexity, and separates two components of mental speed that differentially predict intelligence and cognitive development (reaction time and movement time). The paper reviews key assumptions of DDM, preliminary findings relevant to DDM, and future research on DDM.", "Neurofeedback (NF) is often criticized because of the lack of empirical evidence of its specificity. Our present study thus focused on the specificity of NF on three levels: band specificity, cognitive specificity, and baseline specificity. Ten healthy middle-aged individuals performed ten sessions of SMR (sensorimotor rhythm, 12-15Hz) NF training. A second group (N=10) received feedback of a narrow gamma band (40-43Hz). Effects of NF on EEG resting measurements (tonic EEG) and cognitive functions (memory, intelligence) were evaluated using a pre-post design. Both training groups were able to linearly increase the target training frequencies (either SMR or gamma), indicating the trainability of these EEG frequencies. Both NF training protocols led to nonspecific changes in other frequency bands during NF training. While SMR NF only led to concomitant changes in slower frequencies, gamma training affected nearly the whole power spectrum. SMR NF specifically improved memory functions. Gamma training showed only marginal effects on cognitive functions. SMR power assessed during resting measurements significantly increased after SMR NF training compared to a pre-assessment, indicating specific effects of SMR NF on baseline/tonic EEG. The gamma group did not show any pre-post changes in their EEG resting activity. In conclusion, SMR NF specifically affects cognitive functions (cognitive specificity) and tonic EEG (baseline specificity), while increasing SMR during NF training nonspecifically affects slower EEG frequencies as well (band non-specificity). Gamma NF was associated with nonspecific effects on the EEG power spectrum during training, which did not lead to considerable changes in cognitive functions or baseline EEG activity.", "The Nuremberg Trials raised insightful issues on how and why doctors who were trained in the Hippocratic tradition were able to commit such egregious and heinous medical crimes. The vulnerable were considered to be subhuman, of decreased intelligence, of no moral status and lacking human dignity. The reputation of the medical profession had been undermined, professionalism questioned and the doctor-patient relationship damaged as a result of the Nazi medical experiments. The World Medical Association's Declaration of Helsinki has been hailed as one of the most successful efforts in rescuing medical research from the darkness of the scandals and tragedies in health research. The first Research Ethics Committee in South Africa was established in 1966 at the University of the Witwatersrand. From the mid-1970s other institutions followed suit. The promulgation of the National Health Act No. 61 of 2003, in 2004, resulted in strong protectionism for research participants in the country.", "There has been a surge of interest in using 1 type of risk assessment instrument to tailor treatment to juveniles to reduce recidivism. Unlike prediction-oriented instruments, these reduction-oriented instruments explicitly measure variable risk factors as \"needs\" to be addressed in treatment. There is little evidence, however, that the instruments accurately measure specific risk factors. Based on a sample of 237 serious juvenile offenders (Mage = 18, SD = 1.6), we tested whether California Youth Assessment Inventory (CA-YASI) scores validly assess the risk factors they purport to assess. Youth were assessed by practitioners with good interrater reliability on the CA-YASI, and by research staff on a battery of validated, multimethod criterion measures of target constructs. We meta-analytically tested whether each CA-YASI risk domain score (e.g., Attitudes) related more strongly to scores on convergent measures of theoretically similar constructs (e.g., criminal thinking styles) than to scores on discriminant measures of theoretically distinct constructs (e.g., intelligence, somatization, and pubertal status). CA-YASI risk domain scores with the strongest validity support were those that assess criminal history. The only variable CA-YASI risk domain score that correlated more strongly with convergent (Zr = .35) than discriminant (Zr = .07) measures was Substance Use. There was little support for the construct validity of the remaining 6 variable CA-YASI risk domains-including those that ostensibly assess strong risk factors (e.g., \"Attitudes,\" \"Social Influence\"). Our findings emphasize the need to test the construct validity of reduction-oriented instruments-and refine instruments to precisely measure their targets so they can truly inform risk reduction. (PsycINFO Database Record", "Many studies have described impaired intelligence, attention, memory and executive function in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) dialyzed and non-dialyzed, but there is still a lack of sensitive and early methods of detection of these deficits. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between brain metabolic alteration [measured by magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS)] and cognitive dysfunction in CKD children (detected by psychometric analysis).\nOne hundred and forty patients with CKD were included (40 patients with stage 5 CKD on dialysis, 30 patients with stage 4 to 5 CKD without dialysis, and 70 patients with stage 1 to 3 CKD). All patients with previous neurological disorders were excluded. Conventional MRI, MRS and psychometric assessment using Wechsler intelligence scale for children third edition was done in all participants.\nWe found a significant negative correlation between MRS abnormalities and Wechsler IQ Test scores. But there was a significantly positive correlation between the CKD stages and MRS abnormalities in patients with CKD and negative significant correlation between CKD stages and Wechsler IQ test scores in patients with CKD. There were correlations between \"the electrolyte disturbance, blood haemoglobin and hypertension\" and \"the CKD staging, cognitive functions IQ scores and MRS parameter changes\".\nIt was concluded that both MRS and psychometric tests are sensitive methods for detection of impaired cognitive function in CKD children, particularly in the dialyzed group, and these findings appear before a clinical diagnosis.", "As machine learning/artificial intelligence algorithms are defeating chess masters and, most recently, GO champions, there is interest - and hope - that they will prove equally useful in assisting chemists in predicting outcomes of organic reactions. This paper demonstrates, however, that the applicability of machine learning to the problems of chemical reactivity over diverse types of chemistries remains limited - in particular, with the currently available chemical descriptors, fundamental mathematical theorems impose upper bounds on the accuracy with which raction yields and times can be predicted. Improving the performance of machine-learning methods calls for the development of fundamentally new chemical descriptors.", "There is conflicting evidence regarding the association between adolescent marijuana use and adult intelligence, with some studies suggesting adolescent marijuana use can lead to declines in intelligence. The purpose of this study is to shed additional light on the potential link between marijuana use and changes in intelligence.\nWe employed change scores and ordinary least squares (OLS) analysis to test for associations between marijuana use and changes in intelligence scores from adolescence (ages 12-21) to adulthood (ages 18-26) using data drawn from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health.\nThe findings revealed that while a binary measure of marijuana use (ever/never) maintains a statistically significant association with changes in intelligence scores, the effect sizes are relatively small (\u03b2=0.043-0.051). Additionally, our findings did not reveal a significant association between cumulative marijuana use and changes in intelligence scores.\nTaken together, the results suggest that while the binary measure of marijuana use (ever/never) has a statistically significant association with changes in intelligence scores, the binary measure accounts for at most a 1-2 point change in intelligence scores.", "Benign epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (BECTS) is the most common idiopathic focal childhood epilepsy associated with either unilateral or bilateral epileptic discharge. Asymmetry as an important characteristic of the human brain is beneficial for brain functions. However, little is known about on asymmetry of BECTS patients with different epileptic spikes pattern. In the present study, we investigated functional and structural asymmetries in unilateral spikes BECTS (U_BECTS) patients and bilateral spikes BECTS (B_BECTS) patients using resting state functional magnetic resonance images and diffusion tensor imaging. Compared with the controls, we observed a decreased voxel-mirrored interhemispheric functional connectivity (FC) in primary sensorimotor cortex (SM1) in U_BECTS and B_BECTS groups, and reduced fractional anisotropy (FA) values of the corpus callosum (CC) connecting bilateral SM1 were also observed in B_BECTS group. Further region-based FC map analysis of SM1 demonstrated increased functional asymmetry with ipsilateral hemisphere, contralateral hemisphere and the whole brain in U_BECTS and increased functional asymmetry with the contralateral hemisphere and the whole brain in B_BECTS groups. The correlation between functional asymmetry of SM1 and intelligence quotient scores was found in the U_BECTS group. The altered asymmetries of the SM1 further indicated the important role of SM1 in the pathophysiology of the BECTS. Furthermore, the B_BECTS group also showed abnormal voxel-mirrored interhemispheric FC in the temporal pole, the lobule IX of the cerebellum, the caudate and the occipital cortex relative to the controls. Altogether, our findings provide additional insight into the neuronal mechanism of BECTS with different epileptic spikes pattern and cognitive impairments with BECTS patients.", "Universally, nurses have been reported to be a group at high risk of workplace stress. However, nurses' responses to stressful situations at work could be the outcomes of individual differences and organisational factors.\nWe examined the independent and joint contributions of four dimensions of emotional intelligence and perceived organisational support in work stress of nurses in a teaching hospital in Nigeria.\nThe study was a cross-sectional survey research design, which selected 228 (41 male and 187 female nurses) nurses through the use of convenience sampling. Questionnaires comprising demographics with work stress, organisational support and emotional intelligence scales were administered to the sampled 228 nurses in the study. Data were analysed with the use of correlational matrix and hierarchical multiple regression.\nSelf-emotion appraisal, others' emotion appraisal, use of emotion, regulation of emotion and perceived organisational support were found to have joint contributions to explaining work stress among nurses. Others' emotion appraisal, use of emotion and perceived organisational support were found to have independent relationships with work stress.\nOur findings stress that judgement of others' emotions, accurate use of emotion by nurses and support from management of the hospital are most important in explaining their reactions towards work-related stress.", "Dyskinetic cerebral palsy (CP) has long been associated with basal ganglia and thalamus lesions. Recent evidence further points at white matter (WM) damage. This study aims to identify altered WM pathways in dyskinetic CP from a standardized, connectome-based approach, and to assess structure-function relationship in WM pathways for clinical outcomes. Individual connectome maps of 25 subjects with dyskinetic CP and 24 healthy controls were obtained combining a structural parcellation scheme with whole-brain deterministic tractography. Graph theoretical metrics and the network-based statistic were applied to compare groups and to correlate WM state with motor and cognitive performance. Results showed a widespread reduction of WM volume in CP subjects compared to controls and a more localized decrease in degree (number of links per node) and fractional anisotropy (FA), comprising parieto-occipital regions and the hippocampus. However, supramarginal gyrus showed a significantly higher degree. At the network level, CP subjects showed a bilateral pathway with reduced FA, comprising sensorimotor, intraparietal and fronto-parietal connections. Gross and fine motor functions correlated with FA in a pathway comprising the sensorimotor system, but gross motor also correlated with prefrontal, temporal and occipital connections. Intelligence correlated with FA in a network with fronto-striatal and parieto-frontal connections, and visuoperception was related to right occipital connections. These findings demonstrate a disruption in structural brain connectivity in dyskinetic CP, revealing general involvement of posterior brain regions with relative preservation of prefrontal areas. We identified pathways in which WM integrity is related to clinical features, including but not limited to the sensorimotor system.

The goal of this research is to propose the use of video records as alternative diagnostics of breathing disorders allowing their analysis in the home environment as well. The methods proposed include (i) specific image processing algorithms for detecting facial parts with periodic temperature changes; (ii) computational intelligence tools for analysing the associated videosequences; and (iii) digital filters and spectral estimation tools for processing the depth matrices. Machine learning applied to thermal imaging camera calibration allowed the recognition of its digital information with an accuracy close to 100% for the classification of individual temperature values. The proposed detection of breathing features was used for monitoring of physical activities by the home exercise bike. The results include a decrease of breathing temperature and its frequency after a load, with mean values -0.16 \u00b0C/min and -0.72 bpm respectively, for the given set of experiments. The proposed methods verify that thermal and depth cameras can be used as additional tools for multimodal detection of breathing patterns.", "Executive functions are frequently a weakness in children born preterm. We examined associations of executive functions and general cognitive abilities with brain structure in preterm born adolescents who were born with appropriate weight for gestational age and who have no radiological signs of preterm brain injury on neuroimaging.\nThe Stockholm Neonatal Project (SNP) is a longitudinal, population-based study of children born preterm (<36 weeks of gestation) with very low birth weight (<1501g) between 1988-1993. At age 18 years (mean 18 years, SD 2 weeks) 134 preterm born and 94 full term participants underwent psychological assessment (general intelligence, executive function measures). Of these, 71 preterm and 63 full term participants underwent Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) at mean 15.2 years (range 12-18 years), including 3D T1-weighted images for volumetric analyses and Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) for assessment of white matter microstructure. Group comparisons of regional grey and white matter volumes and fractional anisotropy (FA, as a measure of white matter microstructure) and, within each group, correlation analyses of cognitive measures with MRI metrics were carried out.\nSignificant differences in grey and white matter regional volumes and widespread differences in FA were seen between the two groups. No significant correlations were found between cognitive measures and brain volumes in any group after correction for multiple comparisons. However, there were significant correlations between FA in projection fibres and long association fibres, linking frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital lobes, and measures of executive function and general cognitive abilities in the preterm born adolescents, but not in the term born adolescents.\nIn persons born preterm, in the absence of perinatal brain injury on visual inspection of MRI, widespread alterations in regional brain tissue volumes and microstructure are present in adolescence/young adulthood. Importantly, these alterations in WM tracts are correlated with measures of executive function and general cognitive abilities. Our findings suggest that disturbance of neural pathways, rather than changes in regional brain volumes, are involved in the impaired cognitive functions.", "Williams syndrome (WS) phenotype is described as unique and intriguing. The aim of this study was to investigate the associations between speech-language abilities, general cognitive functioning and behavioural problems in individuals with WS, considering age effects and speech-language characteristics of WS sub-groups.\nThe study's participants were 26 individuals with WS and their parents. General cognitive functioning was assessed with the Wechsler Intelligence Scale. Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test, Token Test and the Cookie Theft Picture test were used as speech-language measures. Five speech-language characteristics were evaluated from a 30-min conversation (clich\u00e9s, echolalia, perseverative speech, exaggerated prosody and monotone intonation). The Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL 6-18) was used to assess behavioural problems.\nHigher single-word receptive vocabulary and narrative vocabulary were negatively associated with CBCL T-scores for Social Problems, Aggressive Behaviour and Total Problems. Speech rate was negatively associated with the CBCL Withdrawn/Depressed T-score. Monotone intonation was associated with shy behaviour, as well as exaggerated prosody with talkative behaviour. WS with perseverative speech and exaggerated prosody presented higher scores on Thought Problems. Echolalia was significantly associated with lower Verbal IQ. No significant association was found between IQ and behaviour problems. Age-associated effects were observed only for the Aggressive Behaviour scale.\nAssociations reported in the present study may represent an insightful background for future predictive studies of speech-language, cognition and behaviour problems in WS.", "In April 2015, Finnish public health authorities alerted European Union member states of a possible multi-country Salmonella enteritidis outbreak linked to an international youth ice-hockey tournament in Latvia. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), Finnish and Latvian authorities initiated an outbreak investigation to identify the source. The investigation included a description of the outbreak, retrospective cohort study, microbiological investigation and trace-back. We identified 154 suspected and 96 confirmed cases from seven countries. Consuming Bolognese sauce and salad at a specific event arena significantly increased the risk of illness. Isolates from Finnish, Swedish and Norwegian cases had an identical multiple-locus variable-number of tandem repeats analysis-profile (3-10-6-4-1). Breaches in hygiene and food storing practices in the specific arena's kitchen allowing for cross-contamination were identified. Riga Cup participants were recommended to follow good hand hygiene and consume only freshly cooked foods. This investigation demonstrated that the use of ECDC's Epidemic Intelligence Information System for Food- and Waterborne Diseases and Zoonoses platform was essential to progress the investigation by facilitating information exchange between countries. Cross-border data sharing to perform whole genome sequencing gave relevant information regarding the source of the outbreak.", "Police detectives come into contact with a community's most dangerous violent offenders, but there is little empirical research concerning detectives' beliefs about their characteristics. Twenty experienced detectives compared the characteristics and attributes of two offenders they believed to be the most dangerous repeat violent offenders in their community with two violent offenders who they believed to be less dangerous. Eighty offenders were identified in total. Thirteen bipolar dangerous-less dangerous constructs that differentiate the most dangerous violent offenders from other violent offenders were identified. The most frequently identified themes, mentioned by three quarters or more of the detectives, are being a heavy drug user (particularly amphetamines), being impulsive, and not thinking of the consequences of one's actions. The next three themes, mentioned by half of the detectives are extensive and regular offending, breadth of offending, and wishing to portray oneself as a 'tough guy'. One theme detectives did not mention frequently is mental illness as being associated with the most violent offenders, suggesting that detectives may miss mental illness in their interactions with offenders. Detectives suggested responding to the most dangerous violent offenders with longer sentences, extensive monitoring and better intelligence.", "Section 7.3 of the Principles of Medical Ethics With Annotations Especially Applicable to Psychiatry (the so-called Goldwater Rule) provides guidance on the ethics of making psychiatric comments about public figures who have not been interviewed and have not given consent. I argue that the wording of Section 7.3 is ambiguous, and I document disagreement over the scope of the rule and consider the implications of this disagreement. If one reads Section 7.3 narrowly, as banning media comments without interview and consent, but allowing such comments in institutional settings, then the general principle articulated in the text and often repeated in the media begins to appear insubstantial. If one reads Section 7.3 broadly, then the work of psychiatrists in the courts, in government agencies such as the Central Intelligence Agency, in insurance companies, and in the academy becomes ethically problematic. I trace the American Psychiatric Association's own interpretation of Section 7.3 and conclude that the APA has advocated a narrow reading. I assert the need for an integrated theory of psychiatric ethics for settings where interview and consent are absent. Such a theory, articulating why comments in institutional settings are ethical, but comments to media are not, may reduce public confusion and provide a basis for revising Section 7.3.", "Forty-two years ago, Capra published \"The Tao of Physics\" (Capra, 1975). In this book (page 17) he writes: \"The exploration of the atomic and subatomic world in the twentieth century has \u2026. necessitated a radical revision of many of our basic concepts\" and that, unlike 'classical' physics, the sub-atomic and quantum \"modern physics\" shows resonances with Eastern thoughts and \"leads us to a view of the world which is very similar to the views held by mystics of all ages and traditions.\" This article stresses an analogous situation in biology with respect to a new theoretical approach for studying living systems, Integral Biomathics (IB), which also exhibits some resonances with Eastern thought. Stepping on earlier research in cybernetics1 and theoretical biology,2 IB has been developed since 2011 by over 100 scientists from a number of disciplines who have been exploring a substantial set of theoretical frameworks. From that effort, the need for a robust core model utilizing advanced mathematics and computation adequate for understanding the behavior of organisms as dynamic wholes was identified. At this end, the authors of this article have proposed WLIMES (Ehresmann and Simeonov, 2012), a formal theory for modeling living systems integrating both the Memory Evolutive Systems (Ehresmann and Vanbremeersch, 2007) and the Wandering Logic Intelligence (Simeonov, 2002b). Its principles will be recalled here with respect to their resonances to Eastern thought.", "The aim of this review is to investigate barriers and challenges of wearable patient monitoring (WPM) solutions adopted by clinicians in acute, as well as in community, care settings. Currently, healthcare providers are coping with ever-growing healthcare challenges including an ageing population, chronic diseases, the cost of hospitalization, and the risk of medical errors. WPM systems are a potential solution for addressing some of these challenges by enabling advanced sensors, wearable technology, and secure and effective communication platforms between the clinicians and patients. A total of 791 articles were screened and 20 were selected for this review. The most common publication venue was conference proceedings (13, 54%). This review only considered recent studies published between 2015 and 2017. The identified studies involved chronic conditions (6, 30%), rehabilitation (7, 35%), cardiovascular diseases (4, 20%), falls (2, 10%) and mental health (1, 5%). Most studies focussed on the system aspects of WPM solutions including advanced sensors, wireless data collection, communication platform and clinical usability based on a specific area or disease. The current studies are progressing with localized sensor-software integration to solve a specific use-case/health area using non-scalable and 'silo' solutions. There is further work required regarding interoperability and clinical acceptance challenges. The advancement of wearable technology and possibilities of using machine learning and artificial intelligence in healthcare is a concept that has been investigated by many studies. We believe future patient monitoring and medical treatments will build upon efficient and affordable solutions of wearable technology.", "The goal for this study was to evaluate several visual search training techniques in an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) simulated task environment.\nOperators controlling remote unmanned vehicles often must perform complex visual search tasks (e.g., target search). These tasks may pose substantial demands on the operator due to various environmental factors. Visual search training may reduce errors and mitigate stress, but the most effective form of training has not been determined.\nParticipants were assigned to one of four training conditions: target, cue, visual scanning, or control. After the training, the effectiveness of the training techniques was tested during a 30-minute simulated UAV flight. A secondary task manipulation was included to further simulate the demands of a realistic UAV control and target search task. Subjective stress and fatigue were also assessed.\nTarget training produced superior target search performances in more hits and fewer false alarms (FAs) when compared to the control condition. The visual scanning and cue trainings were moderately effective. Only target training performance was vulnerable to the secondary task load. The task was stressful, but training did not mitigate stress response.\nTraining participants on the target and the cue appearance as well as active scanning of the visual field is promising for promoting effective target search for this simulated UAV environment.\nThese training techniques could be used in preparation for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) missions that involve target search, especially where target appearance change is likely.", "Social cognitive deficits have been discussed to be endophenotypes for schizophrenia and other serious mental illnesses. The current study aimed to assess emotional intelligence (EI) in unaffected siblings of schizophrenia patients to investigate its potential role as endophenotype for schizophrenia.\nEI was measured in 56 schizophrenia patients, 57 unaffected siblings, and 127 healthy control subjects by using the Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test (MSCEIT). In addition, non-social cognition was assessed with the Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia (BACS). Linear mixed models with compound symmetric correlation structure were used for of the three groups with respect to EI and non-social cognition.\nSchizophrenia patients showed significantly lower overall EI and performed significantly worse in three out of four MSCEIT branches compared to unaffected siblings and control subjects, whereas the two latter groups had comparable EI levels. Similar performance patterns (patients<unaffected siblings=control subjects) were found with respect to non-social cognition. Solely in the \"Tower of London\" test, siblings achieved significantly lower task scores compared to control subjects.\nBased on our results, EI as measured with the MSCEIT does not seem to represent a marker of risk for schizophrenia. Further investigations should concentrate on other EI measures to reassess this finding. (JINS, 2017, 23, 577-583).", "High neuroticism and low agreeableness have been found to predict higher levels of aggression through an increase of negative emotions such as anger. However, previous research has only investigated these indirect associations for physical aggression, whereas evidence for such indirect effects on other types of aggression (i.e., verbal or indirect aggression) is currently lacking. Moreover, no previous work has investigated the moderating role of Ability Emotional Intelligence (AEI), which may buffer against the effects of anger on aggression. The present study (N = 665) directly addresses these gaps in the literature. The results demonstrate that high neuroticism and low agreeableness were indirectly related to higher levels of physical, verbal, and indirect aggression via increased chronic accessibility to anger. Importantly however, the associations with physical aggression were significantly weaker for those higher (vs. lower) on AEI, confirming the buffering role of AEI. We discuss the implications of our findings for theoretical frameworks aiming to understand and reduce aggression and violent behavior.", "Introduction: Benefits from mental health early interventions may not be sustained over time, and longer-term intervention programs may be required to maintain early clinical gains. However, due to the high intensity of face-to-face early intervention treatments, this may not be feasible. Adjunctive internet-based interventions specifically designed for youth may provide a cost-effective and engaging alternative to prevent loss of intervention benefits. However, until now online interventions have relied on human moderators to deliver therapeutic content. More sophisticated models responsive to user data are critical to inform tailored online therapy. Thus, integration of user experience with a sophisticated and cutting-edge technology to deliver content is necessary to redefine online interventions in youth mental health. This paper discusses the development of the moderated online social therapy (MOST) web application, which provides an interactive social media-based platform for recovery in mental health. We provide an overview of the system's main features and discus our current work regarding the incorporation of advanced computational and artificial intelligence methods to enhance user engagement and improve the discovery and delivery of therapy content. Methods: Our case study is the ongoing Horyzons site (5-year randomized controlled trial for youth recovering from early psychosis), which is powered by MOST. We outline the motivation underlying the project and the web application's foundational features and interface. We discuss system innovations, including the incorporation of pertinent usage patterns as well as identifying certain limitations of the system. This leads to our current motivations and focus on using computational and artificial intelligence methods to enhance user engagement, and to further improve the system with novel mechanisms for the delivery of therapy content to users. In particular, we cover our usage of natural language analysis and chatbot technologies as strategies to tailor interventions and scale up the system. Conclusions: To date, the innovative MOST system has demonstrated viability in a series of clinical research trials. Given the data-driven opportunities afforded by the software system, observed usage patterns, and the aim to deploy it on a greater scale, an important next step in its evolution is the incorporation of advanced and automated content delivery mechanisms.", "In the face of shifting demographics and an increase in human longevity, it is important to examine carefully what is known about cognitive ageing, and to identify and promote possibly malleable lifestyle and health-related factors that might mitigate age-associated cognitive decline. The Lothian Birth Cohorts of 1921 (LBC1921, n = 550) and 1936 (LBC1936, n = 1091) are longitudinal studies of cognitive and brain ageing based in Scotland. Childhood IQ data are available for these participants, who were recruited in later life and then followed up regularly. This overview summarises some of the main LBC findings to date, illustrating the possible genetic and environmental contributions to cognitive function (level and change) and brain imaging biomarkers in later life. Key associations include genetic variation, health and fitness, psychosocial and lifestyle factors, and aspects of the brain's structure. It addresses some key methodological issues such as confounding by early-life intelligence and social factors and emphasises areas requiring further investigation. Overall, the findings that have emerged from the LBC studies highlight that there are multiple correlates of cognitive ability level in later life, many of which have small effects, that there are as yet few reliable predictors of cognitive change, and that not all of the correlates have independent additive associations. The concept of marginal gains, whereby there might be a cumulative effect of small incremental improvements across a wide range of lifestyle and health-related factors, may offer a useful way to think about and promote a multivariate recipe for healthy cognitive and brain ageing.", "Cortisol homeostasis is important for healthy brain and cognitive aging. The aim of the current study is to investigate the role of serum cortisol levels in the relationship between regional brain volumes and cognitive processing speed in a group of cognitively normal elderly subjects. Forty-one healthy elderly participants were from a parallel longitudinal study. The reported data in this study reflects baseline measurements. Whole-brain anatomical scanning was performed using a 3.0 Tesla Philips Medical Systems Achieva scanner. Cognitive processing speed was assessed by the digit-symbol and symbol search tests, from the Chinese version of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-third edition (WAIS-III). Serum cortisol levels (sampled in the late morning) were measured by ELISA kits. Whole-brain regression analysis revealed that serum cortisol levels positively predicted the white matter volumes (WMV) of the right thalamus, the gray matter volumes (GMV) of the left thalamus and right cerebellar tonsil, and negatively predicted the WMV and GMV of the left middle temporal gyrus (MTG) in 41 healthy elderly participants. Furthermore, serum cortisol significantly moderated the relationship between the GMV of the left MTG and processing speed, as well as the GMV of the left thalamus and processing speed. This study provided the first piece of evidence supporting serum cortisol levels in moderating the relationship between regional brain volumes and processing speed in healthy elderly subjects. This observation enriches our understanding of the role of cortisol in brain morphology and cognitive functioning.", "Chronotype or morningness-eveningness (M/E) is an individual trait with a biological basis. In this study, I analysed the relationship between M/E and nationwide available data, such as economic variables, school achievement, intelligence and conscientiousness, which is a personality trait. These variables have been chosen because, first, they are linked on the individual level with circadian preference, and, second these associations have been found based on meta-analyses, which gives these findings a high plausibility. In addition, economic status has also been proposed to be related to M/E. Higher developed countries showed a lower morningness, based on both, the ranking of countries as well as on the HDI value. Similarly, GNI was related to morningness, while higher intelligence and performance in PISA were related to eveningness. Conscientiousness was related to morningness, although the results failed the significance level marginally. When using IQ as a control variable in partial correlations, the relationship between GNI and morningness disappeared, as did the correlation between eveningness and PISA results.", "Many patients with epilepsy caused by hypothalamic hamartomas (HHs) have cognitive impairments during the course of the disease or following neurosurgical treatment. The purpose of this study was to assess cognitive function in these patients, as well as factors influencing preoperative cognitive performance and cognitive outcome after neurosurgical treatment. Using the two largest and most detailed neuropsychology datasets on HH and epilepsy from two centers, we retrospectively report on cognitive functions in 48 patients with structural epilepsy due to HH (mean age \u00b1 standard deviation [SD] 20\u00a0\u00b1\u00a012 years, range 5-53 years, median 16\u00a0years; disease duration mean 17\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011\u00a0years). Intelligence, verbal learning and recall, and speed and executive functions (processing speed and cognitive flexibility) were assessed before and on average 19 (\u00b111) months after surgery (interstitial radiosurgery: N\u00a0=\u00a022; neurosurgical resection/disconnection: N\u00a0=\u00a026). Prior to neurosurgical treatment, 52% of patients showed impaired executive and 62% showed reduced verbal memory functions. A trend for a detrimental effect of higher drug load on cognitive functioning was found. After neurosurgical treatment, intellectual functions for the entire cohort tended to increase. This correlated with improved seizure frequency and decreased number of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). However, postoperative outcomes for individual patients were highly variable, with significant deteriorations in 17% (processing speed) to 34% (cognitive flexibility and verbal learning), and performance increases in 17% (intellectual functioning) up to 39% (processing speed) of the patients. Higher levels of presurgical performance were significant predictors of cognitive decline after surgery. These results are highly relevant for patient consultation and may help with therapeutic decisions.", "To evaluate the impact of iron chelating drugs and serum ferritin on the neurocognitive functions of patients with \u03b2 thalassemia major (\u03b2-TM), using psychometric, neurophysiologic and radiologic tests.\nEighty children with \u03b2-TM were enrolled into the study and were compared to 40 healthy controls. All participants were evaluated by measuring serum ferritin, neurocognitive assessment by Benton Visual Retention Test, Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, Wisconsin Card Sort Test, P300 and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS).\nWISC in our study showed that 40% of cases were borderline mental function as regards total IQ. Neurophysiologic tests were significantly impaired in patients compared to control group, with significant impairment in those receiving desferrioxamine (DFO). P300 amplitude was significantly lower in cases compared to controls (2.24 and 4.66\u2005uv, respectively), recording the shortest amplitude in patients receiving DFO. Altered metabolic markers in the brain were detected by MRS in the form of reduced N-acetylaspartate to creatine ratio in 78.3% of our cases. There were significant correlations between psychometric tests and both neurophysiologic (P300) and radiologic (MRS) tests.\n\u03b2-TM is associated with neurocognitive impairment that can be assessed by psychometric, neurophysiologic and radiologic tests. The role of hemosiderosis and iron chelation therapy on cognitive functioning still need more research.\n\u03b2-TM: beta thalassemia major; DFO: Dysferal; DFP: Deferiprone; DFX: Deferasirox; WISC: Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children; VIQ: verbal IQ; PIQ: performance IQ; TIQ: total IQ; BVRT: Benton Visual Retention Test; WCST: Wisconsin Card Sort Test; MRS: Magnetic resonant spectroscopy; NAA/Cr ratio: N-acetylaspartate to creatine ratio.", "Hunting for meat was a critical step in all animal and human evolution. A key brain-trophic element in meat is vitamin B3 / nicotinamide. The supply of meat and nicotinamide steadily increased from the Cambrian origin of animal predators ratcheting ever larger brains. This culminated in the 3-million-year evolution of Homo sapiens and our overall demographic success. We view human evolution, recent history, and agricultural and demographic transitions in the light of meat and nicotinamide intake. A biochemical and immunological switch is highlighted that affects fertility in the 'de novo' tryptophan-to-kynurenine-nicotinamide 'immune tolerance' pathway. Longevity relates to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide consumer pathways. High meat intake correlates with moderate fertility, high intelligence, good health, and longevity with consequent population stability, whereas low meat/high cereal intake (short of starvation) correlates with high fertility, disease, and population booms and busts. Too high a meat intake and fertility falls below replacement levels. Reducing variances in meat consumption might help stabilise population growth and improve human capital.", "With increasing numbers of people surviving beyond eighty years, this section of the population demands attention to reduce the impact of dementia. In order to develop effective preventative strategies, it is essential to understand age-specific risk factor profiles for dementia: do risk factors for dementia in those in their sixties and seventies persist into oldest age? The aims of this study were to determine incident dementia and to investigate the risk profile for dementia from age 79 to 95\u00a0years in a well-characterised cohort.\nParticipants underwent intelligence testing at age 11 and were followed-up from at 79\u00a0years of age. Variables included: age, sex, age 11 IQ, APOE \u025b4, education, diabetes, hypertension, statin use, physical activity at leisure and in occupation, symptoms of depression, height, number of teeth, body mass index, blood pressure, cholesterol and HbA1c. Dementia cases were ascertained from death certificates, electronic patient records and clinical reviews. Logistic regression analysis determined the degree of risk for dementia associated with each variable. Analyses were completed both with and without the physical activity variables due to the significant number of missing data for these variables.\nOf the eligible cohort, n\u00a0=\u00a0410 participants remained dementia-free and n\u00a0=\u00a0110 had developed probable dementia. When logistic regression analyses contained all variables, complete data was available for n\u00a0=\u00a0234 (n\u00a0=\u00a048 with dementia). Results demonstrated that positive APOE \u025b4 carrier status (OR: 2.15, 95% CI: 1.04, 4.42) and greater lifetime physical activity (OR: 1.14, 95% CI: 1.02, 1.28) increased the risk for dementia. A reduction in risk for dementia was seen for hypertension (OR: 0.47, 95% CI: 0.23, 0.98). When physical activity variables were excluded, the number with complete data increased to n\u00a0=\u00a0377 (n\u00a0=\u00a080 with dementia). APOE \u025b4 remained significant (OR: 2.37; 95% CI: 1.37, 4.07), as did hypertension (OR: 0.55; 95% CI: 0.32, 0.93).\nDementia incidence was consistent with expected rates. The risk profile for dementia in this cohort of participants aged 79-95 confirmed previous findings that risk factors differ for those over 79\u00a0years. Further evidence is recommended in order that the risk profile for this age group can be accurately determined.", "Over the course of human history, it has been common to use plants for medicinal purposes, such as for providing relief from particular maladies and self-medication. Opium represents one longstanding remedy that has been used to address a range of medical conditions, alleviating discomfort often in ways that have proven pleasurable. Opium is a combination of compounds obtained from the mature fruit of opium poppy, papaver somniferum. Morphine and its biosynthetic precursors thebaine and codeine constitute the main bioactive opiate alkaloids contained in opium. Opium usage in ancient cultures is well documented, as is its major extract morphine. The presence of endogenous opiate alkaloids and opioid peptides in animals owe their discovery to their consistent actions at particular concentrations via stereo select receptors. In vitro expression of morphine within a microbiological industrial setting underscores the role it plays as a multi-purpose pharmacological agent, as well as reinforcing why it can also lead to long-term social dependence. Furthermore, it clearly establishes a reciprocal effect of human intelligence on modifying evolutionary processes in papaver somniferum and related plant species.", "The purpose of this study is to analyze the combined effects of trait emotional intelligence (EI) and feelings on healthy adolescents' stress. Identifying the extent to which adolescent stress varies with trait emotional differences and the feelings of adolescents is of considerable interest in the development of intervention programs for fostering youth well-being. To attain this goal, self-reported questionnaires (perceived stress, trait EI, and positive/negative feelings) and biological measures of stress (hair cortisol concentrations, HCC) were collected from 170 adolescents (12-14\u2009years old). Two different methodologies were conducted, which included hierarchical regression models and a fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA). The results support trait EI as a protective factor against stress in healthy adolescents and suggest that feelings reinforce this relation. However, the debate continues regarding the possibility of optimal levels of trait EI for effective and adaptive emotional management, particularly in the emotional attention and clarity dimensions and for female adolescents.", "Training of working memory as a method of increasing working memory capacity and fluid intelligence has received much attention in recent years. This burgeoning field remains highly controversial with empirically-backed disagreements at all levels of evidence, including individual studies, systematic reviews, and even meta-analyses. The current study investigated the effect of a randomized six week online working memory intervention on untrained cognitive abilities in a community-recruited sample of healthy young adults, in relation to both a processing speed training active control condition, as well as a no-contact control condition. Results of traditional null hypothesis significance testing, as well as Bayesian factor analyses, revealed support for the null hypothesis across all cognitive tests administered before and after training. Importantly, all three groups were similar at pre-training for a variety of individual variables purported to moderate transfer of training to fluid intelligence, including personality traits, motivation to train, and expectations of cognitive improvement from training. Because these results are consistent with experimental trials of equal or greater methodological rigor, we suggest that future research re-focus on: 1) other promising interventions known to increase memory performance in healthy young adults, and; 2) examining sub-populations or alternative populations in which working memory training may be efficacious.", "Hospital-wide engagement is required to alleviate the problem of ED crowding and its associated adverse effects. To this end, the article describes a novel visualisation termed 'the ED Capacity Clock', which can be formatted using business intelligence software. This radial diagram represents ED capacity and its consumption in a format that can be understood intuitively and at a glance. The ED Capacity Clock is designed to promote common understanding and discussion between relevant hospital services and also acts as an auditing tool to monitor processes implemented to alleviate ED crowding.", "We sought to derive a 'neuropsychological intelligence quotient' (NIQ) to replace IQ testing in some routine assessments.\nWe administered neuropsychological testing and a seven-subtest short form of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale to a community sample of 394 adults aged 18-96\u00a0years. We regressed Wechsler Full Scale IQs (W-FSIQ) on 23 neuropsychological scores and derived an NIQ from 9 measures that explained significant variance in W-FSIQ. We then compared subgroups of 284 healthy and 108 unhealthy participants in NIQ and W-FSIQ to assess criterion validity, correlated NIQ and W-FSIQ scores with education level and independence for activities of daily living to assess convergent validity, and compared validity coefficients for the NIQ with those of 'hold' and 'no-hold' indices.\nBy design, NIQ and W-FSIQ scores correlated highly (r\u00a0=\u00a0.84), and both were higher in healthy participants. The difference was larger for NIQ, which accounted for more variability in activities of daily living. The NIQ and 'no-hold' index were better predicted by health status and less predicted by educational status than the 'hold' index.\nWe constructed an NIQ that correlates highly with Wechsler FSIQ. Tests required to obtain NIQ are commonly used and can be administered in about 45 min. Validity properties of NIQ and W-FSIQ are similar. The NIQ bore greater resemblance to a 'no-hold' than 'hold' index. One can obtain a reasonably accurate estimate of current Full Scale IQ without formal intelligence testing from a brief neuropsychological battery.", "The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship among emotional clarity in emotional intelligence, maternal identity, and fetal attachment to measure how emotional clarity and maternal identity impact on fetal attachment and to determine mediating effects of maternal identity in pregnant women at the time of diagnosis with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM).\nThis study used a correlational survey design. 88 pregnant women with GDM completed a study questionnaire of emotional clarity, maternal identity, and fetal attachment immediately after the diagnosis of GDM. Data were analyzed Mann-Whitney U test, and ANOVA with Duncan test, Pearson correlation, three-step regressions to test mediating effect, and Sobel test.\nThe emotional clarity was positively related with maternal identity and fetal attachment. It affected maternal identity with 21.9% of explained variance. The emotional clarity and the maternal identity were significant predictors of fetal attachment by 57.7% of explained variance. The maternal identity mediated the relationship between emotional clarity and fetal attachment.\nThe results suggest that a nursing program to enhance the emotional clarity and the maternal identity needs to be developed as an effective strategy to improve fetal attachment.", "Drawing upon a sample of 400 female high school students in Tehran, Iran, the present study examines the mediating role of social skills and sensation seeking in the relationship between trait emotional intelligence and school adjustment in adolescent girls. Statistical analysis revealed positive correlations between trait emotional intelligence and school adjustment; trait emotional intelligence and social skills; and social skills and school adjustment. The study also revealed a negative correlation between trait emotional intelligence and sensation seeking, as well as sensation seeking and school adjustment. In addition, the data provided a good fit to the hypothesized model of the mediating role of social skills and sensation seeking in the relationship between trait emotional intelligence and school adjustment.", "Evidence for application of stereotactic and other conformal radiotherapy techniques in treating brain tumors is largely based on data derived from dosimetric, retrospective, or small prospective studies. Therefore, we conducted a randomized clinical trial of stereotactic conformal radiotherapy (SCRT) compared with conventional radiotherapy (ConvRT) evaluating clinically meaningful end points.\nTo compare neurocognitive and endocrine functional outcomes and survival at 5 years in young patients with residual and/or progressive benign or low-grade brain tumors treated with SCRT and ConvRT techniques.\nThis phase 3 randomized clinical trial enrolled 200 young patients (ages 3-25 years) with residual or progressive benign or low-grade brain tumors at a single center between April 2001 to March 2012. Patients were randomly allocated (1:1) to either SCRT (n\u2009=\u2009104) or ConvRT (n\u2009=\u200996) arms.\nPatients were randomly assigned to either high-precision SCRT or ConvRT to a dose of 54 Gy in 30 fractions over 6 weeks.\nDetailed neuropsychological and neuroendocrine assessments were performed at preradiotherapy baseline, at 6 months, and annually thereafter until 5 years on longitudinal follow-up. Change in these functional parameters was compared between the 2 arms as the primary end point and overall survival (OS) as the secondary end point.\nIn total, 200 young patients (median [interquartile range] age, 13 [9-17] years; 133 males and 67 females) were enrolled. Mean full-scale or global intelligence quotient (IQ) and performance IQ scores over a period of 5 years were significantly superior in patients treated with SCRT compared with those treated with ConvRT (difference in slope\u2009=\u20091.48; P\u2009=\u2009.04 vs difference in slope\u2009=\u20091.64; P\u2009=\u2009.046, respectively). Cumulative incidence of developing new neuroendocrine dysfunction at 5 years was significantly lower in patients treated with SCRT compared with ConvRT (31% vs 51%; P\u2009=\u2009.01) while developing a new neuroendocrine axis dysfunction in patients with preexisting dysfunction in at least 1 axis at baseline was also significantly lower in the SCRT arm compared with the ConvRT arm (29% vs 52%; P\u2009=\u2009.02). Five-year OS in SCRT and ConvRT arms was 86% and 91%, respectively (P\u2009=\u2009.54).\nIn young patients with residual and/or progressive benign or low-grade brain tumors requiring radiotherapy for long-term tumor control, SCRT compared with ConvRT achieves superior neurocognitive and neuroendocrine functional outcomes over 5 years without compromising survival.\nclinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00517959.", "Cerebral grey and white matter MRI parameters are related to general intelligence and some specific cognitive abilities. Less is known about how structural brain measures relate specifically to verbal processing abilities. We used multi-modal structural MRI to investigate the grey matter (GM) and white matter (WM) correlates of verbal ability in 556 healthy older adults (mean age = 72.68 years, s.d. = .72 years). Structural equation modelling was used to decompose verbal performance into two latent factors: a storage factor that indexed participants' ability to store representations of verbal knowledge and an executive factor that measured their ability to regulate their access to this information in a flexible and task-appropriate manner. GM volumes and WM fractional anisotropy (FA) for components of the language/semantic network were used as predictors of these verbal ability factors. Volume of the ventral temporal cortices predicted participants' storage scores (\u03b2 = .12, FDR-adjusted p = .04), consistent with the theory that this region acts as a key substrate of semantic knowledge. This effect was mediated by childhood IQ, suggesting a lifelong association between ventral temporal volume and verbal knowledge, rather than an effect of cognitive decline in later life. Executive ability was predicted by FA fractional anisotropy of the arcuate fasciculus (\u03b2 = .19, FDR-adjusted p = .001), a major language-related tract implicated in speech production. This result suggests that this tract plays a role in the controlled retrieval of word knowledge during speech. At a more general level, these data highlight a basic distinction between information representation, which relies on the accumulation of tissue in specialised GM regions, and executive control, which depends on long-range WM pathways for efficient communication across distributed cortical networks.", "The management of thyroid nodules, one of the main clinical challenges in endocrine clinical practice, is usually straightforward. Although the most important concern is ruling out malignancy, there are grey areas where uncertainty is frequently present: the nodules labelled as indeterminate by cytology and the extent of therapy when thyroid cancer is diagnosed pathologically. There is evidence that the current available precision medicine tools (from all the \"-omics\" to molecular analysis, fine-tuning imaging or artificial intelligence) may help to fill present gaps in the future. We present here a commentary on some of the current challenges faced by endocrinologists in the field of thyroid nodules and cancer, and illustrate how precision medicine may improve their diagnostic and therapeutic capabilities in the future.", "To analyze the determinants of cognitive outcome two years after surgery for drug-resistant epilepsy in a cohort of 31 children when compared to a control group of 14 surgical candidates who had yet to undergo surgery two years after the first neuropsychological assessment.\nControlled longitudinal study including three evaluations of IQ (Intelligence Quotient) scores or GDQ (General Developmental Quotient) for each group depending on the patient's age: prior to surgery (T0), one year (T1) and two years (T2) after surgery for the surgical group; baseline (T0) and one year (T1) and 2years (T2) after the first evaluation for the control-group. At follow-up, 25 children (80%) of the surgical group were seizure free, while seizure outcome was unsatisfactory in the remaining six (20%). To analyze language, visuomotor skills, memory, reading, visual attention, and behavior, we selected 11 school age children in the surgical group and nine controls. We reported performance prior to (T0) and one year after surgery (T1).\nThere was a significant correlation between earlier age at seizure onset and lower IQ/GDQ at T0 (r=0.39; p=0.03) in the overall cohort. IQ/GDQ scores did not significantly differ between the surgical and control groups when analyzed at T0 and T2. However, they evolved differently with an improved developmental trajectory becoming identifiable only in the surgical group (F1,31=5.33 p=0.028; \u03b72=0.15). There was also a significant increase of forward digit span (Z=2.33; p=0.02) and Rey recall scores (Z=1.97; p=0.049) in the surgical school age subgroup at T1 versus T0.\nWe identified significantly different developmental trajectories in operated versus non- operated children with improved IQ/GDQ scores in operated children only. We also observed a significant increase of digit span scores and Rey recall scores a year after surgery. Further studies including larger samples with longer follow-ups are needed to confirm these preliminary findings.", "In the 24-month MS-STAT phase 2 trial, we showed that high-dose simvastatin significantly reduced the annualised rate of whole brain atrophy in patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS). We now describe the results of the MS-STAT cognitive substudy, in which we investigated the treatment effect on cognitive, neuropsychiatric, and health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL) outcome measures.\nWe did a secondary analysis of MS-STAT, a 24-month, double-blind, controlled trial of patients with SPMS done at three neuroscience centres in the UK between Jan 28, 2008, and Nov 4, 2011. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to either 80 mg simvastatin (n=70) or placebo (n=70). The cognitive assessments done were the National Adult Reading Test, Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence, Graded Naming Test, Birt Memory and Information Processing Battery (BMIPB), Visual Object and Space Perception battery (cube analysis), Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB), and Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test. Neuropsychiatric status was assessed using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and the Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire. HRQoL was assessed using the self-reported 36-Item Short Form Survey (SF-36) version 2. Assessments were done at study entry, 12 months, and 24 months. Patients, treating physicians, and outcome assessors were masked to treatment allocation. Analyses were by intention to treat. MS-STAT is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00647348.\nBaseline assessment revealed impairments in 60 (45%) of 133 patients on the test of frontal lobe function (FAB), and in between 13 (10%) and 43 (33%) of 130 patients in tests of non-verbal and verbal memory (BMIPB). Over the entire trial, we noted significant worsening on tests of verbal memory (T score decline of 5\u00b77 points, 95% CI 3\u00b76-7\u00b78; p<0\u00b70001) and non-verbal memory (decline of 6\u00b78 points, 4\u00b78-8\u00b77; p<0\u00b70001). At 24 months, the FAB score was 1\u00b72 points higher in the simvastatin-treated group than in the placebo group (95% CI 0\u00b72-2\u00b73). The simvastatin group also had a 2\u00b75 points better mean physical component score of the SF-36 (95% CI 0\u00b73-4\u00b78; p=0\u00b7028). A treatment effect was not noted for any other outcomes.\nTo our knowledge, this SPMS cohort is the largest studied to date with comprehensive longitudinal cognitive, neuropsychiatric, and HRQoL assessments. We found evidence of a positive effect of simvastatin on frontal lobe function and a physical quality-of-life measure. Although we found no effect of simvastatin on the other outcome measures, these potential effects warrant confirmation and underline the importance of fully assessing cognition and quality of life in progressive multiple sclerosis treatment trials.\nThe Moulton Foundation, the Berkeley Foundation, the Multiple Sclerosis Trials Collaboration, the Rosetrees Trust, a personal contribution from A W Pidgley CBE, and the National Institute for Health Research University College London Hospitals Biomedical Research Centre and University College London.", "Cross-sectional studies have indicated impaired neurodevelopment with elevated drinking water manganese concentrations (W-Mn), but potential susceptible exposure windows are unknown.\nWe prospectively evaluated the effects of W-Mn, from fetal life to school age, on children's cognitive abilities and behavior.\nWe assessed cognitive abilities and behavior in 1,265 ten-year-old children in rural Bangladesh using the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC-IV) and the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), respectively. Manganese in drinking water used during pregnancy and by the children at 5 y and 10 y was measured using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry.\nThe median W-Mn was 0.20 mg/L (range 0.001\u20136.6) during pregnancy and 0.34mg/L (<0.001\u20138.7) at 10 y. In multivariable-adjusted linear regression analyses, restricted to children with low arsenic (As) exposure, none of the W-Mn exposures was associated with the children\u2019s cognitive abilities. Stratifying by gender (p for interaction in general <0.081) showed that prenatal W-Mn (3 mg/L) was positively associated with cognitive ability measures in girls but not in boys. W-Mn at all time points was associated with an increased risk of conduct problems, particularly in boys (range 24\u201343% per mg/L). At the same time, the prenatal W-Mn was associated with a decreased risk of emotional problems [odds ratio (OR)=0.39 (95% CI: 0.19, 0.82)] in boys. In girls, W-Mn was mainly associated with low prosocial scores [prenatal W-Mn: OR=1.48 (95% CI: 1.06, 1.88)].\nElevated prenatal W-Mn exposure was positively associated with cognitive function in girls, whereas boys appeared to be unaffected. Early life W-Mn exposure appeared to adversely affect children's behavior. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP631.", "Negative social evaluation is associated with psychopathology. Given the frequency of evaluation through increasingly prevalent virtual social networks, increased understanding of the effects of this social evaluation is urgently required.\nA new digital social peer evaluation experiment (digi-SPEE) was developed to mimic everyday online social interactions between peers. Participants received mildly negative feedback on their appearance, intelligence, and congeniality. Two hundred and forty-one young people [58.9% female, aged 18.9 years (15 to 34)] from an ongoing novel general population twin study participated in this study. Positive affect (PA), negative affect (NA), implicit self-esteem, and cortisol were assessed before and after exposure to the social evaluation experiment.\nThe social evaluation experiment decreased PA (B=-5.25, p<.001) and implicit self-esteem (B=-.19; p<.001), whereas it increased NA (B=5.99; p<.001) and cortisol levels (B=.07; p<.001). Females (PA: B=-7.62; p<.001; NA: B=8.28; p<.001) and participants with higher levels of general psychological distress (PA: B=-.04, p=.035; NA: B=.06; p=.028) showed stronger affective responses. Stressor-induced cortisol increase was stronger in adolescents under the age of 18 than in participants 18 years and older (B=-.06, p=.002).\nThe digi-SPEE represents a social evaluation stressor that elicits biological and implicit and explicit mental changes that are relevant to mechanisms of psychopathology.", "The present study aimed to investigate the efficacy of adenotonsillectomy (AT) for children with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) and the improvement of their cognitive function. Studies on cognitive performance of OSAS children treated with or without AT were identified by searching the Pubmed, EMBASE and Cochrane library. A meta-analysis was conducted to analyze the literature. The random-effects model was used to evaluate 11 eligible studies using an inverse- variance method. The neuropsychological test results of 4 cognitive domains (general intelligence, memory, attention-executive function and verbal ability) were obtained and analyzed. By comparison of cognitive function between OSAS children and healthy controls, the effect sizes of each domain were achieved as follows: general intelligence,-0.5 (P<0.0001); memory,-0.18 (P=0.02); attention-executive function,-0.21 (P=0.002); and verbal ability,-0.48 (P=0.0006). The effect sizes of general intelligence, memory, attention-executive function, and verbal ability after AT compared to baseline level were-0.37 (P=0.008),-0.36 (P=0.0005),-0.02 (P=0.88), and-0.45 (P=0.009), respectively. Comparing the cognitive ability between OSAS children after AT and healthy controls showed that the effect sizes were-0.54 (P=0.0009),-0.24 (P=0.12),-0.17 (P=0.35), and-0.45 (P=0.009) in general intelligence, memory, attention-executive function, and verbal ability, respectively. Our results confirmed that OSAS children performed worse than healthy children in terms of the 4 cognitive domains investigated. After 6-12 months of observation, significant improvement in attention-executive function and verbal ability were found in OSAS children treated with AT compared to their baseline level; restoration of attention-executive function and memory were observed in OSAS children after AT in comparison to healthy controls. Further rigorous randomized controlled trials should be conducted to obtain definitive conclusions.", "In common with most, if not all, papers in this special issue, I will argue that understanding the nature of developmental change and individual differences in intelligence requires a theory of the mechanisms underlying both factors. Insofar as these mechanisms constitute part of the fundamental architecture of cognition, this is also an exercise in unifying the discipline and research on intelligence in both children and adults. However, I argue that a variety of data support a theory suggesting that developmental change is the province of mechanisms commonly regarded as components of executive functioning or cognitive control, whereas individual differences are constrained by the speed of information processing. Perhaps paradoxically, this leads to the conclusion that Binet's fundamental insight-that children's increasing ability to solve problems of increasing difficulty could generate a single scale of intelligence-is wrong. Compounding the paradox, this means that mental age and IQ are not simply two different ways of expressing the same thing, but are related to two different dimensions of g itself.", "The cochlear implant (CI) has been shown to be associated with better hearing, cognitive abilities, and functional independence. There is variability however in how much benefit each recipient derives from his or her CI. This study's primary objective is to determine the effects of individual and environmental characteristics on CI outcomes.\nSeventy-six adults who developed postlingual severe to profound hearing loss and received their first unilateral CI at 65 years and older were eligible for the study. Fifty-five patients were asked to participate and the 33 (60%) with complete data were classified as \"group 1.\" The remaining patients were placed in \"group 2.\" Primary outcomes included changes in quality of life and open-set speech perception scores. Independent variables included age, health status, trait emotional intelligence (EI), comfort with technology, and living arrangements. Survey outcomes and audiological measurements were collected prospectively at 12 months after surgery, whereas preoperative data were collected retrospectively. Comparisons between groups 1 and 2 were made. Wilcoxon signed rank test, Spearman correlations, Mann-Whitney tests, Chi-square tests, and linear regressions were performed only on group 1 data.\nHaving a CI was associated with improved quality of life and speech perception. Familiarity with electronic tablets was associated with increased 12-month postoperative AzBio gains when adjusted for preoperative AzBio scores (adjusted p = 0.019), but only marginally significant when a family-wise error correction was applied (p = 0.057). Furthermore, patients who lived with other people scored at least 20 points higher on the AzBio sentences than those who lived alone (adjusted p = 0.046). Finally, consultation with an auditory rehabilitation therapist was associated with higher self-reported quality of life (p = 0.035).\nThis study suggests that in a cohort of older patients cochlear implantation is associated with a meaningful increase in both quality of life and speech perception. Furthermore, it suggests the potential importance of adjunct support and services, including the tailoring of CI rehabilitation sessions depending on the patient's familiarity with technology and living situation. Investment in rehabilitation and other services is associated with improvements in quality of life and may mitigate clinical, individual and social risk factors for poor communication outcome.", "In addition to determining sex, the X chromosome has long been considered to play a crucial role in brain development and intelligence. Turner syndrome (TS) is caused by the congenital absence of all or part of one of the X chromosomes in females. Thus, Turner syndrome provides a unique \"knock-out model\" for investigating how the X chromosome influences the human brain in vivo. Numerous cutting-edge neuroimaging techniques and analyses have been applied to investigate various brain phenotypes in women with TS, which have yielded valuable evidence toward elucidating the causal relationship between the X chromosome and human brain structure and function. In this review, we comprehensively summarize the recent progress made in TS-related neuroimaging studies and emphasize how these findings have enhanced our understanding of X chromosome function with respect to the human brain. Future investigations are encouraged to address the issues of previous TS neuroimaging studies and to further identify the biological mechanisms that underlie the function of specific X-linked genes in the human brain.", "Much has been written about the benefits that mathematics can bring to the UK economy and the manufacturing sector in particular, but less on the value of mathematicians and a mathematical training. This article, written from an industry perspective, considers the value of mathematicians to the UK's industrial base and the importance to the UK economy of encouraging young people in the UK to choose to study mathematics at school as a gateway to a wide range of careers. The points are illustrated using examples from the author's 20 years' experience in the security and intelligence and manufacturing sectors.", "Both prenatal testosterone (T) exposure and postnatal T levels have been associated with developing neural circuitry and behavioral systems. This study examined the potential correlation between pre- and postnatal T levels and behavioral and neurocognitive profiles of children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).\nTwo hundred ADHD patients with a mean age of 8.7\u00b12.0 years (158 boys and 42 girls) were recruited. The ratio of the length of the right index finger (2D) to that of the right ring finger (4D) (2D/4D ratio) served as a surrogate of prenatal T exposure, and postnatal T was determined using salivary T concentration. Behavioral symptoms were evaluated using the Swanson, Nolan, and Pelham - Version IV Scale for ADHD (SNAP-IV). Neurocognitive function was assessed using the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children - Fourth Edition (WISC-IV) and Conners' Continuous Performance Test (CPT).\nLower 2D/4D ratios were associated with comorbid disruptive behavior disorders (t=2.15, P=0.033) in all participants. Among the boys with ADHD, neither 2D/4D ratios nor salivary T levels were associated with behavioral symptoms or neurocognitive function. Among the girls with ADHD, the salivary T level was positively correlated with the Perceptual Reasoning Index of the WISC-IV (r=0.48, P=0.001) and the Confidence Index (r=0.37, P=0.017) and Omission Errors of the CPT (r=0.62, P<0.001).\nFindings suggest that a higher prenatal T exposure is associated with a greater risk of developing disruptive behavior disorders, and T may exert differential neurocognitive effects between boys and girls with ADHD. However, the neurobiological mechanisms of T involved in the pathogenesis of ADHD warrant further investigation.", "Human intellect is characterized by intercorrelated psychological domains, including intelligence, academic performance and personality. Higher openness is associated with higher intelligence and better academic performance, yet high performance among individuals is itself attributable to intelligence, not openness. High conscientiousness individuals, although not necessarily more intelligent, are better performers. Work with other species is not as extensive, yet animals display similar relationships between exploration- and persistence-related personality traits and performance on cognitive tasks. However, previous studies linking cognition and personality have not tracked learning, performance and dropout over time-three crucial elements of cognitive performance. We conducted three participatory experiments with touchscreen cognitive tasks among 19 zoo-housed chimpanzees, whose personalities were assessed 3 years prior to the study. Performance and participation were recorded across experiments. High conscientiousness chimpanzees participated more, dropped out less and performed better, but their performance could be explained by their experience with the task. High openness chimpanzees tended to be more interested, perform better and continue to participate when not rewarded with food. Our results demonstrate that chimpanzees, like humans, possess broad intellectual capacities that are affected by their personalities.", "Traditionally, research in anti-doping has been stimulated by the need for technological improvements to accommodate the expansion of the list of prohibited substances and methods. Nevertheless, in recent years, anti-doping found itself at a crossroads due to the increasing complexity and constant refinement of doping methods. As illustrated by the 2012 USADA (United States Anti-Doping Agency) versus Lance Armstrong case, a change in paradigm was necessary. The exploration of new scientific avenues to understand the mechanisms of doping and pinpoint its practice was most needed to allow designing more efficient preventive or disruptive strategies. In this context, and at the time of writing in 2017, transposing the concept of forensic intelligence to anti-doping was identified as a promising approach to address the different aspects of doping, from the individual athlete to organized doping and trafficking of substances in a proactive rather than a reactive way. Indeed, collection, structuring, and logical processing of multiple sources of information, and not strictly results of bioanalytical testing of urinary and blood samples, can bring additional value to detect and describe potential, emerging, or existing doping issues. This anti-doping intelligence can provide anti-doping authorities and relevant stakeholders with timely, accurate, and usable information for decision making to solve, reduce, and/or prevent doping-related activities. The integration of intelligence to complement other anti-doping approaches is a potentially major step forward in the development of more effective and robust anti-doping strategies.", "In tests of object recognition, individual differences typically correlate modestly but nontrivially across familiar categories (e.g. cars, faces, shoes, birds, mushrooms). In theory, these correlations could reflect either global, non-specific mechanisms, such as general intelligence (IQ), or more specific mechanisms. Here, we introduce two separate methods for effectively capturing category-general performance variation, one that uses novel objects and one that uses familiar objects. In each case, we show that category-general performance variance is unrelated to IQ, thereby implicating more specific mechanisms. The first approach examines three newly developed novel object memory tests (NOMTs). We predicted that NOMTs would exhibit more shared, category-general variance than familiar object memory tests (FOMTs) because novel objects, unlike familiar objects, lack category-specific environmental influences (e.g. exposure to car magazines or botany classes). This prediction held, and remarkably, virtually none of the substantial shared variance among NOMTs was explained by IQ. Also, while NOMTs correlated nontrivially with two FOMTs (faces, cars), these correlations were smaller than among NOMTs and no larger than between the face and car tests themselves, suggesting that the category-general variance captured by NOMTs is specific not only relative to IQ, but also, to some degree, relative to both face and car recognition. The second approach averaged performance across multiple FOMTs, which we predicted would increase category-general variance by averaging out category-specific factors. This prediction held, and as with NOMTs, virtually none of the shared variance among FOMTs was explained by IQ. Overall, these results support the existence of object recognition mechanisms that, though category-general, are specific relative to IQ and substantially separable from face and car recognition. They also add sensitive, well-normed NOMTs to the tools available to study object recognition.", "The present study aimed to assess the effects of an early childhood nutrition counselling intervention on intelligence (as measured by the intelligence quotient (IQ)) at age 15-16 years.\nA single-blind, cluster-randomised trial.\nIn 1998, in Southern Brazil, mothers of children aged 18 months or younger were enrolled in a nutrition counselling intervention (n 424). Counselling included encouragement and promotion of exclusive breast-feeding until 6 months of age and continued breast-feeding supplemented by protein-, lipid- and carbohydrate-rich foods after age 6 months up to age 2 years. The control group received routine feeding advice. In 2013, the fourth round of follow-up of these individuals, at the age of 15-16 years, was undertaken. IQ was assessed using the short form of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS-III). Mental disorders (evaluated using the Development and Well-Being Assessment (DAWBA)) and self-reported school failure, smoking and alcohol use were also investigated. Adjusted analyses were conducted using a multilevel model in accordance with the sampling process.\nAdolescents, mean (sd) age of 15\u00b74 (0\u00b75) years (n 339).\nMean (sd) total IQ score was lower in the intervention group than the control group (93\u00b74 (11\u00b74) and 95\u00b78 (11\u00b72), respectively) but the association did not persist after adjustment. The prevalence of any mental disorders was similar between intervention and control groups (23\u00b71 and 23\u00b75 %, respectively). There were no differences between groups regarding school failure, smoking and alcohol use.\nNutrition counselling intervention in early childhood had no effect on intelligence measured during adolescence.", "Social and emotional problems are commonly reported after moderate to severe acquired brain injury (ABI) and pose a significant barrier to rehabilitation. However, progress in assessment of emotional skills has been limited by a lack of validated measurement approaches. This study represents the first formal psychometric evaluation of the use of the Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test (MSCEIT) V2.0 as a tool for assessing skills in perceiving, using, understanding and managing emotions following ABI. The sample consisted of 82 participants aged 18-80 years in the postacute phase of recovery (2 months-7 years) after moderate to severe ABI. Participants completed the MSCEIT V2.0 and measures of cognition and mood. Sociodemographic and clinical variables were collated from participant interview and medical files. Results revealed deficits across all MSCEIT subscales (approximately 1 SD below the normative mean). Internal consistency was adequate at overall, area, and branch levels, and MSCEIT scores correlated in expected ways with key demographic, clinical, cognitive, and mood variables. MSCEIT performance was related to injury severity and clinician-rated functioning after ABI. Confirmatory factor analysis favored a 3-factor model of EI due to statistical redundancy of the Using Emotions branch. Overall, these findings suggest that the MSCEIT V2.0 is sensitive to emotion processing deficits after moderate to severe ABI, and can yield valid and reliable scores in an ABI sample. In terms of theoretical contributions, our findings support a domain-based, 3-factor approach for characterizing emotion-related abilities in brain-injured individuals. (PsycINFO Database Record", "Intelligent agents such as robots can form ad hoc networks and replace human being in many dangerous scenarios such as a complicated disaster relief site. This project prototypes and builds a computer simulator to simulate robot kinetics, unsupervised learning using Kohonen networks, as well as group intelligence when an ad hoc network is formed. Each robot is modeled using an object with a simple set of attributes and methods that define its internal states and possible actions it may take under certain circumstances. As the result, simple, reliable, and affordable robots can be deployed to form the network. The simulator simulates a group of robots as an unsupervised learning unit and tests the learning results under scenarios with different complexities. The simulation results show that a group of robots could demonstrate highly collaborative behavior on a complex terrain. This study could potentially provide a software simulation platform for testing individual and group capability of robots before the design process and manufacturing of robots. Therefore, results of the project have the potential to reduce the cost and improve the efficiency of robot design and building.", "A comprehensive approach is needed for diagnosing disordered attachment behavior due to the multifaceted nature of attachment. Differences between various indicators can pose a challenge for deciding on the proper diagnosis. This study assessed the convergence between clinical interview assessment and observation-based clinical diagnosis, and their linkages with inadequate care.\nParticipating children ( N\u2009=\u200955) had intelligence quotients (IQs) between 50 and 85 and were referred for psychiatric consultation. Data were obtained by structured review of medical records, the Disturbances of Attachment Interview (DAI), and the Clinical Observation of Attachment (COA) procedure.\nOf the 18 children identified using the DAI with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-Fifth Edition (DSM-5) diagnosis of reactive attachment disorder (RAD) and/or disinhibited social engagement disorder (DSED), only 7 received a clinical DSM-5 diagnosis of RAD and/or DSED. Observed maladaptive attachment behavior in the COA was strongly associated with DAI scores and with clinical diagnosis of DSM-5 RAD and/or DSED. There was a significantly higher prevalence of extremes of insufficient care in children who were classified with RAD by DAI or DSM-5 and/or with DSED by DSM-5 compared to those with no attachment disorder.\nUsing structured observation and record assessment leads to more conservative identification of RAD or DSED than using the DAI.", "Trajectory approaches are a popular way of identifying subgroups of children and adolescents at high risk for developing alcohol use problems. However, mounting evidence challenges the meaning and utility of these putatively discrete alcohol trajectories, which can be analytically derived even in the absence of real subgroups. This study tests the hypothesis that alcohol trajectories may not reflect discrete groups-that the development of alcohol use is continuous rather than categorical.\nA multiwave longitudinal-epidemiologic twin study was conducted using 3,762 twins (1,808 male and 1,954 female) aged 11 to 29 years from the Minnesota Center for Twin and Family Research (MCTFR). The main outcome measures included various assessments of substance use, psychopathology, personality, and cognitive ability.\nAlthough multiple trajectories are derived from growth mixture modeling techniques, these trajectories are arrayed in a tiered spectrum of severity, from lower levels of use to higher levels of use. Trajectories show perfect rank-order stability throughout development, monotonic increases in heritability, and perfect rank-order correlations with established correlates of alcohol use, including other substance use behaviors, psychiatric disorders, personality traits, intelligence, and achievement.\nAlcohol trajectories may represent continuous gradations rather than qualitatively distinct subgroups. If so, early detection and interventions for youth based on trajectory subtyping will be less useful than continuous liability assessments. Furthermore, a continuous account of development counters the notion that individuals are predestined to follow one of a few categorically distinct pathways and promotes the opposite idea-that development is mutable, and its continuous terrain can be traversed in many directions.", "There are manifold intriguing issues located within largely unexplored borderlands of bioethics, future studies (including global risk analysis), and astrobiology. Human enhancement has for quite some time been among the foci of bioethical debates, but the same cannot be said about its global, transgenerational, and even cosmological consequences. In recent years, discussions of posthuman and, in general terms, postbiological civilization(s) have slowly gained a measure of academic respect, in parallel with the renewed interest in the entire field of future studies and the great strides made in understanding of the origin and evolution of life and intelligence in their widest, cosmic context. These developments promise much deeper synergic answers to questions regarding the long-term future of enhancement: how far can it go? Is human enhancement a further step toward building a true postbiological civilization? Should we actively participate and help shape this process? Is the future of humanity \"typical\" in the same Copernican sense as our location in space and time is typical in the galaxy, and if so, can we derive important insights about the evolutionary pathways of postbiological evolution from astrobiological and Search for ExtraTerrestrial Intelligence (SETI) studies? These and similar questions could be understood as parts of a possible unifying research program attempting to connect cultural and moral evolution with what we know and understand about their cosmological and biological counterparts.", "The Fagan Test of Infant Intelligence (FTII) uses longer gaze length for unfamiliar versus familiar human faces to gauge visual-spatial encoding, attention, and working memory in infants. Our objective was to establish the feasibility of automated eye tracking with the FTII in HIV-exposed Ugandan infants.\nThe FTII was administered to 31 perinatally HIV-exposed noninfected (HEU) Ugandan children 6-12\u00a0months of age (11 boys; M\u00a0=\u00a00.69\u00a0years, SD\u00a0=\u00a00.14; 19 girls; M\u00a0=\u00a00.79, SD\u00a0=\u00a00.15). A series of 10 different faces were presented (familiar face exposure for 25\u00a0s followed by a gaze preference trial of 15\u00a0s with both the familiar and unfamiliar faces). Tobii X2-30 infrared camera for pupil detection provided automated eye-tracking measures of gaze location and length during presentation of Ugandan faces selected to correspond to the gender, age (adult, child), face expression, and orientation of the original FTII. Eye-tracking gaze length for unfamiliar faces was correlated with performance on the Mullen Scales of Early Learning (MSEL).\nInfants gazed longer at the novel picture compared to familiar across 10 novelty preference trials. Better MSEL cognitive development was correlated with proportionately longer time spent looking at the novel faces (r(30)\u00a0=\u00a00.52, p\u00a0=\u00a0.004); especially for the Fine Motor Cognitive Sub-scale (r(30)\u00a0=\u00a00.54, p\u00a0=\u00a0.002).\nAutomated eye tracking in a human face recognition test proved feasible and corresponded to the MSEL composite cognitive development in HEU infants in a resource-constrained clinical setting. Eye tracking may be a viable means of enhancing the validity and accuracy of other neurodevelopmental measures in at-risk children in sub-Saharan Africa.", "Childhood cognitive ability is associated with lifestyle in adulthood, including self-reported physical activity (PA). We examined whether childhood cognitive ability is associated with objectively measured PA and sedentary time (ST) in young adulthood.\nParticipants of the Arvo Ylpp\u00f6 Longitudinal Study (n = 500) underwent tests of general reasoning, visuomotor integration, verbal competence, and language comprehension at the age of 56 months yielding a general intelligence factor score; at the age of 25 years they wore omnidirectional accelerometers for 9 days (range = 4-10 days) measuring overall daily PA (counts per minute, cpm), ST, and light and moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) (minutes), and completed a questionnaire on occupational, commuting, leisure-time conditioning and nonconditioning PA.\nAfter adjustment for sex, age, BMI-for-age SD score at 56 months. and mean of valid minutes of measurement period for PA, per each 1 SD increase in the childhood general intelligence factor score, overall daily PA decreased by -8.99 cpm/day, ST increased by 14.93 min/day, time spent in light PA decreased by -14.39 min/day, and the odds per each level increase in physical demandingness of the work and in time spent in nonconditioning leisure-time PA decreased by 38% and 31%, respectively (p values < 0.04). These associations were mediated via higher young adulthood level of education.\nIn contrast to expected, in this cohort of young adults with high variability in PA, of whom many were still studying, higher childhood cognitive ability was associated with more objectively measured and self-reported physical inactivity. Whether these findings persist beyond young adulthood is a subject of further studies. (PsycINFO Database Record", "Personalized medicine is not a new concept. The renaissance of the term is due to the enormous progress in gene sequencing technology and functional imaging, as well as the development of targeted therapies. Application of these technologies in clinical medicine will necessitate infrastructural as well as organizational and educational changes in the healthcare system. An important change required already in the short-term is the introduction of centralized structures, preferably in university clinics, which adopt these innovations and incorporate them into clinical care. Simultaneously, the collation and use of large quantities of relevant data from highly variable sources must be successfully mastered, in order to pave the way for disruptive technologies such as artificial intelligence.", "Electronic sensors capable of capturing mechanical deformation are highly desirable for the next generation of artificial intelligence products. However, it remains a challenge to prepare self-healing, highly sensitive, and cost-efficient sensors for both tiny and large human motion monitoring. Here, a new kind of self-healing, sensitive, and versatile strain sensors has been developed by combining metal-ligand chemistry with hierarchical structure design. Specifically, a self-healing and nanostructured conductive layer is deposited onto a self-healing elastomer substrate cross-linked by metal-ligand coordinate bonds, forming a hierarchically structured sensor. The resultant sensors exhibit high sensitivity, low detection limit (0.05% strain), remarkable self-healing capability, as well as excellent reproducibility. Notably, the self-healed sensors are still capable to precisely capture not only tiny physiological activities (such as speech, swallowing, and coughing) but also large human motions (finger and neck bending, touching). Moreover, harsh treatments, including bending over 50000 times and mechanical washing, could not influence the sensitivity and stability of the self-healed sensors in human motion monitoring. This proposed strategy via alliance of metal-ligand chemistry and hierarchical structure design represents a general approach to manufacturing self-healing, robust sensors, and other electronic devices.", "To determine the relationship between brain abnormalities on newborn magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and neurodevelopmental impairment at 7 years of age in very preterm children.\nA total of 223 very preterm infants (<30 weeks of gestation or <1250\u2009g) born at Melbourne's Royal Women's Hospital had a brain MRI scan at term equivalent age. Scans were scored using a standardized system that assessed structural abnormality of cerebral white matter, cortical gray matter, deep gray matter, and cerebellum. Children were assessed at 7 years on measures of general intelligence, motor functioning, academic achievement, and behavior.\nOne hundred eighty-six very preterm children (83%) had both an MRI at term equivalent age and a 7-year follow-up assessment. Higher global brain, cerebral white matter, and deep gray matter abnormality scores were related to poorer intelligence quotient (IQ) (Ps\u2009<\u2009.01), spelling (Ps\u2009<\u2009.05), math computation (Ps\u2009<\u2009.01), and motor function (Ps\u2009<\u2009.001). Higher cerebellum abnormality scores were related to poorer IQ (P\u2009=\u2009.001), math computation (P\u2009=\u2009.018), and motor outcomes (P\u2009=\u2009.001). Perinatal, neonatal, and social confounders had little effect on the relationships between the MRI abnormality scores and outcomes. Moderate-severe global abnormality on newborn MRI was associated with a reduction in IQ (-6.9 points), math computation (-7.1 points), and motor (-1.9 points) scores independent of the other potential confounders.\nStructured evaluation of brain MRI at term equivalent is predictive of outcome at 7 years of age, independent of clinical and social factors.", "Gaze-following is a basic cognitive ability found in numerous primate and nonprimate species. However, little is known about this ability and its variation in colobine monkeys. We compared gaze-following of two Asian colobines-Fran\u00e7ois' langurs (Trachypithecus francoisi) and golden snub-nosed monkeys (Rhinopithecus roxellana). Although both species live in small polygynous family units, units of the latter form multilevel societies with up to hundreds of individuals. Fran\u00e7ois' langurs (N\u00a0=\u00a015) were less sensitive to the gaze of a human experimenter than were golden snub-nosed monkeys (N\u00a0=\u00a012). We then tested the two species using two classic inhibitory control tasks-the cylinder test and the A-not-B test. We found no difference between species in inhibitory control, which called into question the nonsocial explanation for Fran\u00e7ois' langur's weaker sensitivity to human gaze. These findings are consistent with the social intelligence hypothesis, which predicted that golden snub-nosed monkeys would outperform Fran\u00e7ois' langurs in gaze-following because of the greater size and complexity of their social groups. Furthermore, our results underscore the need for more comparative studies of cognition in colobines, which should provide valuable opportunities to test hypotheses of cognitive evolution.", "In the past decade diabetes management has been transformed by the addition of continuous glucose monitoring and insulin pump data. More recently, a wide variety of functions and physiologic variables, such as heart rate, hours of sleep, number of steps walked and movement, have been available through wristbands or watches. New data, hydration, geolocation, and barometric pressure, among others, will be incorporated in the future. All these parameters, when analyzed, can be helpful for patients and doctors' decision support. Similar new scenarios have appeared in most medical fields, in such a way that in recent years, there has been an increased interest in the development and application of the methods of artificial intelligence (AI) to decision support and knowledge acquisition. Multidisciplinary research teams integrated by computer engineers and doctors are more and more frequent, mirroring the need of cooperation in this new topic. AI, as a science, can be defined as the ability to make computers do things that would require intelligence if done by humans. Increasingly, diabetes-related journals have been incorporating publications focused on AI tools applied to diabetes. In summary, diabetes management scenarios have suffered a deep transformation that forces diabetologists to incorporate skills from new areas. This recently needed knowledge includes AI tools, which have become part of the diabetes health care. The aim of this article is to explain in an easy and plane way the most used AI methodologies to promote the implication of health care providers-doctors and nurses-in this field.", "A Quantitative Structure Activity Relationship (QSAR) model was developed in order to predict physicochemical and biochemical properties of industrial chemicals of various groups. This model was based on the solvation equation, originally proposed by Abraham. In this work Abraham's solvation model got parameterized using artificial intelligence techniques such as artificial neural networks (ANNs) for the prediction of partitioning into kidney, heart, adipose, liver, muscle, brain and lung for the estimation of the bodyweight-normalized maximal metabolic velocity (Vmax) and the Michaelis - Menten constant (Km). Model parameterization using ANNs was compared to the use of non-linear regression (NLR) for organic chemicals. The coupling of ANNs with Abraham's solvation equation resulted in a model with strong predictive power (R2 up to 0.95) for both partitioning and biokinetic parameters. The proposed model outperformed other QSAR models found in the literature, especially with regard to the estimation and prediction of key biokinetic parameters such as Km. The results show that the physicochemical descriptors used in the model successfully describe the complex interactions of the micro-processes governing chemical distribution and metabolism in human tissues. Moreover, ANNs provide a flexible mathematical framework to capture the non-linear biochemical and biological interactions compared to less flexible regression techniques.", "We employed our previously developed 27-plex ancestry-informative single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) panel to infer the ancestral components of bone remains of a possible foreign pilot found in south-western China. For ancestry assignment of this unknown individual, we first obtained the 27-SNP genotype of the individual. Then, based on a reference database of 3081 individuals from 33 populations, we calculated the match probability and likelihood ratio using the self-developed software program Forensic Intelligence. Inferred ancestral components of this individual were calculated by structure at K = 3. A complete profile was obtained for the individual using our multiplexed SNP assay. The European population was within one order of magnitude of the highest likelihood. The major ancestral component of this individual was 97.6% European.", "Prior to the formation of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), the fight against doping in sport was not unified; instead, it relied on individual approaches established by various stakeholders to make it effective. The scandal of the Festina Affair, during the Tour de France 1998, and other drug doping scandals revealed the ineffectiveness and inadequacy of such an approach. The resulting media scandal raised public authorities' awareness about the necessity to deal with doping in sport with a harmonized and a more effective approach. The International Olympic Committee interceded and convened a World Conference on Doping, bringing together all parties involved in the fight against doping. As a result, WADA was established on November 10, 1999, in Lausanne to promote and coordinate the fight against doping in sport internationally. In this regard, the World Anti-Doping Code (WADC or the Code) is the core document harmonizing anti-doping rules and regulations within sport organizations and public authorities. The Code was instrumental in introducing the concept of \"nonanalytical\" rule violations, which are emphasized within the revised 2015 Code. Nonanalytical rule violations allow anti-doping organizations (ADOs) to apply sanctions in cases where there is no positive doping sample, but where there may still be evidence that a doping violation has occurred. This recognition of \"nonanalytical\" rule violations by WADA is the concrete result of taking into account lessons learned from prior infamous doping scandals. Thus, intelligence gathering, particularly through cooperation with global law enforcement agencies, is a key tool in the fight against doping. The 2015 Code and the international standards on testing and investigations establish and implement intelligence gathering as part of ADOs' routine activities in the fight against doping in sport.", "Treating patients is complex, and research shows that there are differences in cognitive resources between physicians who experience difficulties, and those who do not. It is possible that differences in\u00a0some cognitive resources could explain the difficulties faced by some physicians. In this study, we explore differences in cognitive resources between different groups of physicians (that is, between native (UK) physicians and International Medical Graduates\u00a0(IMG); those who continue with training versus those who were subsequently removed from the training programme); and also between physicians experiencing difficulties compared with the general population.\nA secondary evaluation was conducted on an anonymised dataset provided by the East Midlands Professional Support Unit (PSU). One hundred and twenty one postgraduate trainee physicians took part in an Educational Psychology assessment through PSU. Referrals to the PSU were mainly on the basis of problems with exam progression and difficulties in communication skills, organisation and confidence. Cognitive resources were assessed using the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS-IV). Physicians were categorised into three PSU outcomes: 'Continued in training', 'Removed from training' and 'Active' (currently accessing the PSU).\nUsing a one-sample Z test, we compared the referred physician sample to a UK general population sample on the WAIS-IV and found the referred sample significantly higher in Verbal Comprehension (VCI; z\u00a0=\u00a08.78) and significantly lower in Working Memory (WMI; z\u00a0=\u00a0-4.59). In addition, the native sample were significantly higher in Verbal Comprehension than the UK general population sample (VCI; native physicians: z\u00a0=\u00a09.95, p\u00a0<\u00a0.001, d = 1.25), whilst there was a lesser effect for the difference between the IMG sample and the UK general population (z = 2.13,\u00a0p\u00a0= .03, d = 0.29). Findings also showed a significant difference in VCI scores between those physicians who were 'Removed from training' and those who 'Continued in training'.\nOur results suggest it is important to understand the cognitive resources of physicians to provide a more focussed explanation of those who experience difficulties in training. This will help to implement more targeted interventions to help physicians develop compensatory strategies.", "Given the mixed conclusions on the psychometric properties of the Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS) and the variety of subsets of items identified as abbreviated forms, the current study aimed to (a) further investigate the performance of single items and different combinations of items of the MAAS from within an Item Response Theory framework, (b) to expand upon existing knowledge about the coverage of the construct of the scale and its shortened versions. A sample of 914 participants (67.6% women; mean age 23.28, SD\u2009=\u20094.77) completed the MAAS. To fulfill the second aim of the study, of the total sample, two subsamples (N\u2009=\u2009156 and N\u2009=\u2009158, respectively) were administered a battery of self-report questionnaires. Analyses attested that four items of the MAAS have weak psychometric properties and that the reliability of the scale remains unchanged when these items are excluded. The relationships with several constructs (consciousness, present-time attitude, emotional intelligence, alexithymia, emotion regulation strategies, behavioral inhibition and activation, affect, anxiety, and depression) provided evidence that the scale adequately reflects the operationalization of the construct, although some facets of the construct are only partially covered. The current findings confirm that the MAAS might be slightly shortened without reducing its reliability and validity, but drastically abbreviated forms, such as the proposed five-item version, fail to maintain adequate psychometric properties.", "Proper nutrition is critical for maximizing brain function and enhancing learning. There is accumulating evidence that early malnutrition, marked by stunting, is associated with long-term deficits in cognitive and academic performance, even when social and psychological differences are controlled. All over the world, children living without permanent parental care are at a heightened risk for under-nutrition, putting their health and development in great jeopardy.\nTo assess the nutritional and cognitive status in institutionalized orphans which might help to formulate effective interventions for improving the nutritional status of vulnerable children in future.\nThis cross-sectional, study included 70 children (35 orphans and 35 non-orphans). Their anthropometric measurements (height, weight, and BMI) were measured and cognition was assessed using subsets of Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised (WISC-R): Block design and Digit span. The data obtained was subjected to descriptive statistical analysis.\n18.57% (13) of children had stunting, 15.71% (11) had wasting, 22.86% (16) were underweight, and 17.14% (12) showed thinness. Mean\u00b1SD of Block design in non-orphans was significantly higher compared to orphans (p-value 0\u00b705). Mean\u00b1SD of Digit span in non-orphans was significantly higher compared to orphans (p-value 0\u00b7000). For Block design, there was moderate positive correlation with nutritional status based on Z-scores (p-value <0\u00b705). Digit span also showed moderate positive correlation (p-value <0\u00b705).\nThe results of our study indicate that children in orphanages have high rates of both malnutrition and cognitive delay compared to the non-orphans and there was a direct correlation between both the variables. If orphanages are here to stay as a last resort for children deprived of a family there is an urgent need to improve the institutional environment in order to foster the development of millions of children in orphanages around the world.", "Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS), a complication of ovarian stimulation, has various adverse effects on both pregnant women and their offspring. However, whether OHSS will affect intellectual ability in offspring is still unknown.\nWe recruited 86 Chinese children born to OHSS women and 172 children conceived with non-OHSS In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) in this cohort study. Their intellectual ability was assessed according to the Revised Chinese Version of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (C-WISC). Verbal Intelligence Quotient (VIQ), Performance Intelligence Quotient (PIQ), and Full Intelligence Quotient (FIQ) were calculated. The investigation was registered in Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR-SOC-16009555).\nOHSS offspring scored less on C-WISC (mean (standard deviation [SD]): (VIQ=92.7 (14.7), PIQ=108.9 (13.1), FIQ=100.6 (13.4)) compared with non-OHSS IVF offspring (VIQ=100.1 (13.2), PIQ=113.7 (10.8), FIQ=107.4 (11.5)). The prevalence of low IQ (<80) children was 4.7 times higher in OHSS offspring compared with non-OHSS offspring. Maternal estradiol level on hCG administration day was negatively associated with FIQ in offspring.\nOHSS offspring displayed reduced intellectual ability. Prenatal estradiol exposure might be involved in underlying mechanism.", "Neurological and radiologic research results show an abnormal cerebral microstructure as well as abnormal neurodevelopment in patients treated for hypoplastic left heart syndrome. The aim of this study was to assess the varying cognitive performance these children have developed in dependence upon prenatal diagnosis, surgical techniques, surgical learning effects, anatomy, perfusion techniques, gender, pedagogic, and sociodemographic parameters in comparison to age-adjusted normative values. School-age children (6.3-16.9\u00a0years) with hypoplastic left heart syndrome, who were treated at the Children's heart Center Linz between 1997 and 2009, (n\u00a0=\u00a074), were surveyed in reference to cognitive achievements. 43 patients were examined prospectively by psychologists using the Wechsler intelligence scale for children IV in order to determine the respective total intelligence quotient index for each child's developmental stage. The mean index was 84.5 (percentile rank 26.4). The statistical spread and standard deviation ranged from a minimum of 40 to a maximum of 134\u00a0\u00b1\u00a020.8. The results for verbal comprehension, perceptual reasoning, and processing speed corresponded with total index results and were thus lower than the mean value of the normative values. The assessment of working memory showed results in the average. Prenatal diagnosis, type of lung perfusion, anatomy, and various cerebral perfusion techniques did not significantly affect the cognitive results of the patients. The results show that hypoplastic left heart syndrome patients can be successfully tutored formally as well as personally in cognitive areas, although when compared to healthy children, they showed lower results for intellectual area parameters.", "Embedded systems control and monitor a great deal of our reality. While some \"classic\" features are intrinsically necessary, such as low power consumption, rugged operating ranges, fast response and low cost, these systems have evolved in the last few years to emphasize connectivity functions, thus contributing to the Internet of Things paradigm. A myriad of sensing/computing devices are being attached to everyday objects, each able to send and receive data and to act as a unique node in the Internet. Apart from the obvious necessity to process at least some data at the edge (to increase security and reduce power consumption and latency), a major breakthrough will arguably come when such devices are endowed with some level of autonomous \"intelligence\". Intelligent computing aims to solve problems for which no efficient exact algorithm can exist or for which we cannot conceive an exact algorithm. Central to such intelligence is Computer Vision (CV), i.e., extracting meaning from images and video. While not everything needs CV, visual information is the richest source of information about the real world: people, places and things. The possibilities of embedded CV are endless if we consider new applications and technologies, such as deep learning, drones, home robotics, intelligent surveillance, intelligent toys, wearable cameras, etc. This paper describes the Eyes of Things (EoT) platform, a versatile computer vision platform tackling those challenges and opportunities.", "Although with early treatment phenylketonuria patients may have average intelligence levels, it is important to optimize the nutritional management to maintain adequate phenylalanine levels, so that patients can develop their intellectal potential free of abnormalities in their daily activities due to deficits of cognitive executive functions. This study presents a series of 26 patients, diagnosed and treated early, who underwent a psychometric evaluation together with phenylalanine determinations along their lives, and at the time of doing the tests. A trend is observed towards a reverse relationship between IQ and concurrent phenylalanine concentration, phenylalanine median and phenylalanine/tyrosine ratio. Likewise, a trend towards a negative relationship is observed between executive functions and concurrent phenylalanine values along patients' lives.\nAunque, con tratamiento precoz, los pacientes con fenilcetonuria pueden presentar niveles de inteligencia normales, es importante optimizar el control diet\u00e9tico para mantener niveles de fenilalanina adecuados y poder desarrollar su potencial intelectual sin alteraciones en sus tareas diarias por d\u00e9ficits en las funciones ejecutivas.

Dr. Bell, who served as director of the National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases (NCEZID) from 2010 to 2017 and as an Epidemic Intelligence Service Officer during 1992-1994, was one of the first public health responders on the scene for this landmark public health emergency.", "Embedded validity indicators (EVIs) are cost-effective psychometric tools to identify non-credible response sets during neuropsychological testing. As research on EVIs expands, assessors are faced with an emerging contradiction: the range of credible impairment disappears between the 'normal' and 'invalid' range of performance. We labeled this phenomenon as the invalid-before-impaired paradox. This study was designed to explore the origin of this psychometric anomaly, subject it to empirical investigation, and generate potential solutions.\nArchival data were analyzed from a mixed clinical sample of 312 (MAge\u00a0=\u00a045.2; MEducation\u00a0=\u00a013.6) patients medically referred for neuropsychological assessment. The distribution of scores on eight subtests of the third and fourth editions of Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) were examined in relation to the standard normal curve and two performance validity tests (PVTs).\nAlthough WAIS subtests varied in their sensitivity to non-credible responding, they were all significant predictors of performance validity. While subtests previously identified as EVIs (Digit Span, Coding, and Symbol Search) were comparably effective at differentiating credible and non-credible response sets, their classification accuracy was driven by their base rate of low scores, requiring different cutoffs to achieve comparable specificity.\nInvalid performance had a global effect on WAIS scores. Genuine impairment and non-credible performance can co-exist, are often intertwined, and may be psychometrically indistinguishable. A compromise between the alpha and beta bias on PVTs based on a balanced, objective evaluation of the evidence that requires concessions from both sides is needed to maintain/restore the credibility of performance validity assessment.", "Category learning in animals is typically trained explicitly, in most instances by varying the exemplars of a single category in a matching-to-sample task. Here, we show that male rhesus macaques can learn categories by a transitive inference paradigm in which novel exemplars of five categories were presented throughout training. Instead of requiring decisions about a constant set of repetitively presented stimuli, we studied the macaque's ability to determine the relative order of multiple exemplars of particular stimuli that were rarely repeated. Ordinal decisions generalized both to novel stimuli and, as a consequence, to novel pairings. Thus, we showed that rhesus monkeys could learn to categorize on the basis of implied ordinal position, without prior matching-to-sample training, and that they could then make inferences about category order. Our results challenge the plausibility of association models of category learning and broaden the scope of the transitive inference paradigm.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The cognitive abilities of nonhuman animals are of enduring interest to scientists and the general public because they blur the dividing line between human and nonhuman intelligence. Categorization and sequence learning are highly abstract cognitive abilities each in their own right. This study is the first to provide evidence that visual categories can be ordered serially by macaque monkeys using a behavioral paradigm that provides no explicit feedback about category or serial order. These results strongly challenge accounts of learning based on stimulus-response associations.", "Increasing evidence indicates that multiple structures in the brain are associated with intelligence and cognitive function at the network level. The association between the grey matter (GM) structural network and intelligence and cognition is not well understood. We applied a multivariate approach to identify the pattern of GM and link the structural network to intelligence and cognitive functions. Structural magnetic resonance imaging was acquired from 92 healthy individuals. Source-based morphometry analysis was applied to the imaging data to extract GM structural covariance. We assessed the intelligence, verbal fluency, processing speed, and executive functioning of the participants and further investigated the correlations of the GM structural networks with intelligence and cognitive functions. Six GM structural networks were identified. The cerebello-parietal component and the frontal component were significantly associated with intelligence. The parietal and frontal regions were each distinctively associated with intelligence by maintaining structural networks with the cerebellum and the temporal region, respectively. The cerebellar component was associated with visuomotor ability. Our results support the parieto-frontal integration theory of intelligence by demonstrating how each core region for intelligence works in concert with other regions. In addition, we revealed how the cerebellum is associated with intelligence and cognitive functions.", "In the present study, diopside nanopowders were prepared via mechanical milling with eggshell as the calcium source. The space holder method (compaction of ceramic powder and spacer) as one of the most important methods to produce ceramic/metal scaffolds was used to produce diopside scaffolds. For the first time, the effect of the spacer size on mechanical properties and porosity of the obtained scaffolds was experimentally discussed. According to the results obtained, the NaCl particles (as the spacer) with the size of 400-600\u00b5m maintained their original spherical shape during the compaction and sintering processes. As a new work, the most important parameters including the spacer type, spacer concentration, spacer size, and applied pressure were considered, and their effects on mechanical properties and porosity of diopside scaffolds were simulated. Gene Expression Programming (GEP), as one of the most branches of the artificial intelligence, was used for simulation process. By using the GEP, two equations were introduced to predict the compressive strength and porosity of the obtained scaffolds with the lowest error values. The 3D diagrams extracted from the model were used to evaluate the combined effect of the process parameters on the compressive strength and porosity of the scaffolds. The GEP model presented in this work has a very low level of error and a high level of the squared regression for predicting the compressive strength and porosity of diopside scaffolds.", "In children with dyslexia, deficits in working memory have not been well-specified. We assessed second-grade children with dyslexia, with and without concomitant specific language impairment, and children with typical development. Immediate serial recall of lists of phonological (non-word), lexical (digit), spatial (location) and visual (shape) items were included. For the latter three modalities, we used not only standard span but also running span tasks, in which the list length was unpredictable to limit mnemonic strategies. Non-word repetition tests indicated a phonological memory deficit in children with dyslexia alone compared with those with typical development, but this difference vanished when these groups were matched for non-verbal intelligence and language. Theoretically important deficits in serial order memory in dyslexic children, however, persisted relative to matched typically developing children. The deficits were in recall of (1) spoken digits in both standard and running span tasks and (2) spatial locations, in running span only. Children with dyslexia with versus without language impairment, when matched on non-verbal intelligence, had comparable serial order memory, but differed in phonology. Because serial orderings of verbal and spatial elements occur in reading, the careful examination of order memory may allow a deeper understanding of dyslexia and its relation to language impairment.

It enables the exploitation of novel materials and processes without formal models or complex simulation. In this article, we focus upon the coevolutionary nature of the design process when it is decomposed into concurrent sub-design-threads due to the overall complexity of the task. Using an abstract, tunable model of coevolution, we consider strategies to sample subthread designs for whole-system testing and how best to construct and use surrogate models within the coevolutionary scenario. Drawing on our findings, we then describe the effective design of an array of six heterogeneous vertical-axis wind turbines.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) is a field of computer science that aims to mimic human thought processes, learning capacity, and knowledge storage. AI techniques have been applied in cardiovascular medicine to explore novel genotypes and phenotypes in existing diseases, improve the quality of patient care, enable cost-effectiveness, and reduce readmission\u00a0and mortality rates. Over the past decade, several machine-learning techniques have been used\u00a0for cardiovascular disease diagnosis and prediction. Each problem requires some degree of understanding of the problem, in terms of cardiovascular medicine and statistics, to apply the optimal machine-learning algorithm. In the near future, AI will result in a paradigm shift toward precision cardiovascular medicine. The potential of AI in cardiovascular medicine is tremendous; however, ignorance of the challenges may overshadow its potential clinical impact. This paper gives a glimpse of AI's application in cardiovascular clinical care and discusses its potential role in\u00a0facilitating precision cardiovascular medicine.", "Despite much current research into the visual processing style of individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), understanding of the neural mechanisms is lagging, especially with respect to the contributions of the overlapping dichotomies of magnocellular/parvocellular (afferent neural pathways), global/local (perception) and dorsal/ventral (cortical streams). Here, we addressed this deficiency by measuring inspection times (ITs) for novel global/local stimuli as well as recording nonlinear visually evoked potentials (VEPs), in particular, magnocellular and parvocellular temporal efficiencies. The study was conducted on a group of male ASD children and a typically developing (TD) group matched for mean age and mean non-verbal intelligence, as measured by the Raven's Progressive Matrices. The IT results did not differ between groups, however a negative correlation between global IT and Raven's score was found in the ASD group, that was not evident in the TD group. Nonlinear VEP showed the ASD group had smaller amplitude parvocellular-generated second order responses compared to the TD group. This is a sign of improved temporal responsiveness in ASD vs. TD groups. Principal Component Analysis linked global IT, non-verbal intelligence scores and VEP parvocellular efficiency in a single factor for the ASD but not the TD group. The results are suggestive of a constraint on pathways available for cognitive response in the ASD group, with temporal processing for those with ASD becoming more reliant on the parvocellular pathway.", "Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is characterized by progressive muscular weakness with symptoms caused by involvement of the brain. The aim of this study was to delineate global changes in cortical thickness and white matter integrity in patients with DM1, compared to age-matched healthy controls, and in brain areas highly correlated with CTG repeat size.\nCortical thickness and white matter integrity were compared in nine adult DM1 patients and age matched healthy controls using T1-weighted and diffusion tensor imaging. The patients' intelligence quotient (IQ) and CTG repeat size were measured in each individual.\nCortical thickness was significantly reduced in the frontal, temporal, and occipital cortices, while tract-based spatial statistics showed decreased diffusion metrics in widespread areas, including the bilateral orbitofrontal, anterior frontal, insular, external capsule, and occipital cortices in DM1 patients, compared to controls. Additionally, thickness was negatively correlated with the number of CTG repeats in those areas. White matter integrity was negatively correlated with CTG repeats in the left entorhinal, anterior corona radiata, orbitofrontal, and lateral occipital areas. No statistically significant correlation was found between IQ scores and the size of CTG repeats.\nOur results suggest that DM1 is associated with wide distributions of network changes in both gray and white matter. Some of areas related to cognition showed significant correlations with CTG repeats.", "During the last years, it has been established that the prefrontal and posterior parietal brain lobes, which are mostly related to intelligence, have many connections to cerebellum. However, there is a limited research investigating cerebellum's relationship with cognitive processes. In this study, the network of cerebellum was analyzed in order to investigate its overall organization in individuals with low and high fluid [corrected] Intelligence Quotient (IQ). Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data were selected from 136 subjects in resting-state from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) database and were further separated into two IQ groups composed of 69 low-IQ and 67 high-IQ subjects. Cerebellum was parcellated into 28 lobules/ROIs (per subject) using a standard cerebellum anatomical atlas. Thereafter, correlation matrices were constructed by computing Pearson's correlation coefficients between the average BOLD time-series for each pair of ROIs inside the cerebellum. By computing conventional graph metrics, small-world network properties were verified using the weighted clustering coefficient and the characteristic path length for estimating the trade-off between segregation and integration. In addition, a connectivity metric was computed for extracting the average cost per network. The concept of the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) was adopted and implemented in order to avoid methodological biases in graph comparisons and retain only the strongest connections per network. Subsequently, six global and three local metrics were calculated in order to retrieve useful features concerning the characteristics of each MST. Moreover, the local metrics of degree and betweenness centrality were used to detect hubs, i.e., nodes with high importance. The computed set of metrics gave rise to extensive statistical analysis in order to examine differences between low and high-IQ groups, as well as between all possible gender-based group combinations. Our results reveal that both male and female networks have small-world properties with differences in females (especially in higher IQ females) indicative of higher neural efficiency in cerebellum. There is a trend toward the same direction in men, but without significant differences. Finally, three lobules showed maximum correlation with the median response time in low-IQ individuals, implying that there is an increased effort dedicated locally by this population in cognitive tasks.", "The constructs of fluid (Gf) and crystalized (Gc) intelligence represent an early attempt to describe the mechanisms of problem solving in the vertebrate brain. Modern neuroscience demonstrates that problem solving involves interplay between the mechanisms of automaticity and anticipatory control, enabling nature's elegant solution to the challenges animals face in their environment. Studies of neural functioning are making clear the primary role of cortical-subcortical interactions in the manifestation of intelligent behavior in humans and other vertebrates. A tridimensional model of intelligent problem solving is explored, wherein the basal ganglia system (BGS) and cerebrocerebellar system (CCS) interact within large scale brain networks. The BGS and CCS work together to enable automaticity to occur. The BGS enables the organism to learn what to do through a powerful instrumental learning system. The BGS also regulates when behavior is released through an inhibitory system which is incredibly sensitive to context. The CCS enables the organism to learn how to perform adaptive behaviors. Internal cerebellar models enable gradual improvements in the quality of behavioral output. The BGS and CCS interact within large scale brain networks, including the dorsal attention network (DAN), ventral attention network (VAN), default mode network (DMN) and frontoparietal network (FPN). The interactions of these systems enable vertebrate organisms to develop a vast array of complex adaptive behaviors. The benefits and importance of developing clinical tests to measure the integrity of these systems is considered.", "The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of chronotype and social jetlag (SJL) on intelligence. Subjects were aged 14-25 years (n = 1008). A significant effect of intelligence on academic performance, as measured by the Raven's Standard Progressive Matrices test, was found (F2,917 = 11.75, P < 0.0001, \u03b72 = 0.03). When SJL was less than 2 hours, the intelligence of people with late chronotype was found to be higher than that of subjects with early and intermediate chronotypes (F2,305 = 3.12, P < 0.05, \u03b72 = 0.02). A negative effect of SJL on the results of intelligence testing was noted only in subjects with late chronotype (F2,536 = 2.61, P < 0.05, \u03b72 = 0.02). Our data suggest that people with late chronotype have a higher level of intelligence, but these advantages disappear when SJL \u22652 hours.", "Accumulating evidence indicates that cognitive decline depends not only upon changes in brain health, but critically, also upon nutritional status. Decline in fluid intelligence, one of the most debilitating aspects of cognitive aging, has been linked to omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) status; however, it is not known whether this phenomenon results from specific omega-3 PUFAs acting on particular aspects of brain health. Therefore, this study aims to explore whether particular patterns of omega-3 PUFAs influence fluid intelligence by supporting specific neural structures.\nWe measured six plasma phospholipid omega-3 PUFAs, fluid intelligence, and regional gray matter volume in the frontal and parietal cortices in 100 cognitively intact older adults (65-75 years old). A four-step mediation analysis was implemented using principal component analysis and multivariate linear regressions, adjusted for age, gender, education, and body mass index.\nThe mediation analysis revealed that one pattern of omega-3 PUFAs, consisting of alpha-linolenic acid, stearidonic acid, and eicosatrienoic acid, was linked to fluid intelligence, and that total gray matter volume of the left frontoparietal cortex (FPC) fully mediated the relationship between this omega-3 PUFA pattern and fluid intelligence.\nThese data demonstrate that fluid intelligence may be optimally supported by specific omega-3 PUFAs through preservation of FPC gray matter structure in cognitively intact older adults. This report provides novel evidence for the benefits of particular omega-3 PUFA patterns on fluid intelligence and underlying gray matter structure.", "MECP2 duplication syndrome (MDS) is a rare pediatric disease and mainly manifests as delayed motor development, language loss or delay, recurrent infection, severe intellectual disability, epilepsy, autistic symptoms, and early infantile hypotonia. In this article, the three children with this disease were all boys. Cases 1 and 2 had delayed motor development, and language loss or delay as initial manifestations, and case 3 had recurrent infection as initial manifestation. Physical examination showed hypotonia and negative pathological signs in each case. Case 1 had tonic-clonic seizures and electroencephalography showed focal seizures, for which he was given oxcarbazepine, levetiracetam, and clonazepam as the antiepileptic treatment to control seizures. Case 3 experienced one absence seizure and three head-nodding seizures with normal electroencephalographic findings during these seizures, and therefore, he was not given antiepileptic treatment. In each case, recurrent infection was improved with the increase in age, but there were no significant improvements in language or intelligence. Array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) showed MECP2 duplication in X chromosome in each case, and so they were diagnosed with MDS. MDS should be considered for children with delayed development complicated by recurrent infection and epileptic seizures, and early aCGH helps with the diagnosis of this disease.\nMECP2\u91cd\u590d\u7efc\u5408\u5f81\uff08MDS\uff09\u662f\u513f\u79d1\u5c11\u89c1\u75c5\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u8868\u73b0\u4e3a\u8fd0\u52a8\u53d1\u80b2\u843d\u540e\u3001\u8bed\u8a00\u7f3a\u5931\u6216\u843d\u540e\u3001\u53cd\u590d\u611f\u67d3\u3001\u4e25\u91cd\u667a\u529b\u969c\u788d\u3001\u766b\u764e\u3001\u5b64\u72ec\u75c7\u6837\u8868\u73b0\u53ca\u5a74\u513f\u65e9\u671f\u808c\u5f20\u529b\u4f4e\u4e0b\u7b49\u3002\u8be5\u65873\u4f8b\u60a3\u513f\u5747\u4e3a\u7537\u5b69\uff0c\u75c5\u4f8b1\u30012\u9996\u53d1\u8868\u73b0\u4e3a\u8fd0\u52a8\u53d1\u80b2\u843d\u540e\u3001\u8bed\u8a00\u7f3a\u5931\u6216\u843d\u540e\uff0c\u75c5\u4f8b3\u9996\u53d1\u8868\u73b0\u4e3a\u53cd\u590d\u611f\u67d3\uff0c\u67e5\u4f53\u5747\u6709\u808c\u5f20\u529b\u5747\u4f4e\u4e0b\u3001\u75c5\u7406\u5f81\u5747\u9634\u6027\u3002\u75c5\u4f8b1\u6709\u5168\u8eab\u5f3a\u76f4-\u9635\u631b\u53d1\u4f5c\uff0c\u8111\u7535\u56fe\u793a\u5c40\u7076\u6027\u53d1\u4f5c\uff0c\u4e88\u5965\u5361\u897f\u5e73\u3001\u5de6\u4e59\u62c9\u897f\u5766\u3001\u6c2f\u785d\u57fa\u5b89\u5b9a\u8054\u5408\u6297\u766b\u764e\u6cbb\u7597\uff0c\u766b\u764e\u53d1\u4f5c\u63a7\u5236\u3002\u75c5\u4f8b3\u51fa\u73b0\u8fc7\u5931\u795e\u53d1\u4f5c1\u6b21\u53ca\u70b9\u5934\u53d1\u4f5c3\u6b21\uff0c\u53d1\u4f5c\u95f4\u671f\u591a\u6b21\u8111\u7535\u56fe\u6b63\u5e38\uff0c\u672a\u4e88\u6297\u766b\u764e\u6cbb\u7597\u30023\u4f8b\u60a3\u513f\u7684\u53cd\u590d\u611f\u67d3\u968f\u5e74\u9f84\u589e\u957f\u5f97\u5230\u6539\u5584\uff0c\u8bed\u8a00\u53ca\u667a\u529b\u6539\u5584\u4e0d\u660e\u663e\u3002\u5fae\u9635\u5217\u6bd4\u8f83\u57fa\u56e0\u7ec4\u6742\u4ea4\u6280\u672f\uff08aCGH\uff09\u68c0\u6d4b\u53d1\u73b03\u4f8b\u60a3\u513f\u7684X\u67d3\u8272\u4f53\u5b58\u5728MECP2\u57fa\u56e0\u91cd\u590d\uff0c\u786e\u8bca\u4e3aMDS\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u53d1\u80b2\u843d\u540e\u4f34\u53cd\u590d\u611f\u67d3\u3001\u766b\u764e\u53d1\u4f5c\u7684\u60a3\u513f\uff0c\u5e94\u8003\u8651\u5230MDS\u53ef\u80fd\uff0c\u65e9\u671f\u884caCGH\u68c0\u6d4b\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u8bca\u65ad\u3002", "The varying trend of a moving vehicle's angles provides much important intelligence for an unattended ground sensor (UGS) monitoring system.

Children with severe intellectual disability or behavioral problems were excluded. The relationship between the Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS), the Manual Ability Classification System (MACS), and the Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory (PEDI) was analyzed. Simple and multiple linear regression analyses were conducted for continuous variables, such as verbal intelligence quotient (IQ) and PEDI subscales.\nFinal evaluation was done for 25 children, ranging from 4 to 11 years of age. According to GMFCS levels, the differences in PEDI-self-care scores, showed statistically borderline significance (p=0.051). Conversely, differences in PEDI-self-care scores according to CP types and MACS levels were not statistically significant. Simple linear regression analysis showed that PEDI mobility and PEDI social function significantly influence the PEDI self-care. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that PEDI mobility was the only factor significantly influencing PEDI self-care in children aged \u22657 years (R2=0.875, p=0.03).\nMobility is important for the acquisition of self-care abilities in children with CP aged \u22657 years.", "Marijuana (Cannabis sativa L.) is a plant cultivated and trafficked worldwide as a source of fiber (hemp), medicine, and intoxicant. The development of a validated method using molecular techniques such as short tandem repeats (STRs) could serve as an intelligence tool to link multiple cases by means of genetic individualization or association of cannabis samples. For this purpose, a 13 loci STR multiplex method was developed, optimized, and validated according to relevant ISFG and SWGDAM guidelines. The STR multiplex consists of 13 previously described C. sativa STR loci: ANUCS501, 9269, 4910, 5159, ANUCS305, 9043, B05, 1528, 3735, CS1, D02, C11, and H06. A sequenced allelic ladder consisting of 56 alleles was designed to accurately genotype 101 C. sativa samples from three seizures provided by a U.S. Customs and Border Protection crime lab. Using an optimal range of DNA (0.5-1.0ng), validation studies revealed well-balanced electropherograms (inter-locus balance range: 0.500-1.296), relatively balanced heterozygous peaks (mean peak height ratio of 0.83 across all loci) with minimal artifacts and stutter ratio (mean stutter of 0.021 across all loci). This multi-locus system is relatively sensitive (0.13ng of template DNA) with a combined power of discrimination of 1 in 55 million. The 13 STR panel was found to be species specific for C. sativa; however, non-specific peaks were produced with Humulus lupulus. The results of this research demonstrate the robustness and applicability of this 13 loci STR system for forensic DNA profiling of marijuana samples.", "Superconducting circuit technologies have recently achieved quantum protocols involving closed feedback loops. Quantum artificial intelligence and quantum machine learning are emerging fields inside quantum technologies which may enable quantum devices to acquire information from the outer world and improve themselves via a learning process. Here we propose the implementation of basic protocols in quantum reinforcement learning, with superconducting circuits employing feedback- loop control. We introduce diverse scenarios for proof-of-principle experiments with state-of-the-art superconducting circuit technologies and analyze their feasibility in presence of imperfections. The field of quantum artificial intelligence implemented with superconducting circuits paves the way for enhanced quantum control and quantum computation protocols.", "Anterior encephaloceles are rare malformations that are frequently associated with other brain anomalies. This study evaluates the growth and psychological development of children following encephalocele repair.\nGrowth and psychological assessment was done in 24 children with only encephalocele (group I); nine children with encephalocele and hydrocephalus (group II); seven children with encephalocele, hydrocephalus, and secondary malformations (group III); and 40 apparently healthy control subjects. Psychological assessment was done by evaluating intelligence and temperament.\nSingle-stage repair was performed in 38 children, and two underwent multistage repair. Major postoperative complications were noted in three individuals. The follow-up period ranged from 12 to 168\u00a0months, and during this time the growth velocity declined significantly among group II and group III patients when compared with control subjects. After adjusting the body mass index for age, our data revealed that group III participants had a significantly (P\u00a0=\u00a00.02) lower body mass index than the control group. Group III also had poor indices for intelligence quotient\u00a0(P\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.01) and temperament (P\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.01). Female patients had lower temperament indices when compared with unaffected females\u00a0with regard to approach withdrawal (P\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.01), mood (P\u00a0=\u00a00.026), and intensity (P\u00a0=\u00a00.03). Overall, increased disease severity adversely affected the psychological indices.\nIndividuals with anterior encephalocele without associated intracranial defects had excellent postoperative outcomes in terms of growth and psychological developments. Hydrocephalus and agenesis of corpus callosum had the least impact on psychological development. However, the presence of secondary brain defects led to developmental delays. Gender differences in temperament may suggest a need for distinct treatment regimens to assess psychosocial well-being for males and females.", "Although intelligence should theoretically evolve to help animals solve specific types of problems posed by the environment, it is unclear which environmental challenges favour enhanced cognition, or how general intelligence evolves along with domain-specific cognitive abilities. The social intelligence hypothesis posits that big brains and great intelligence have evolved to cope with the labile behaviour of group mates. We have exploited the remarkable convergence in social complexity between cercopithecine primates and spotted hyaenas to test predictions of the social intelligence hypothesis in regard to both cognition and brain size. Behavioural data indicate that there has been considerable convergence between primates and hyaenas with respect to their social cognitive abilities. Moreover, compared with other hyaena species, spotted hyaenas have larger brains and expanded frontal cortex, as predicted by the social intelligence hypothesis. However, broader comparative study suggests that domain-general intelligence in carnivores probably did not evolve in response to selection pressures imposed specifically in the social domain. The cognitive buffer hypothesis, which suggests that general intelligence evolves to help animals cope with novel or changing environments, appears to offer a more robust explanation for general intelligence in carnivores than any hypothesis invoking selection pressures imposed strictly by sociality or foraging demands.", "Emotional intelligence (EI) has been associated with positive outcomes for nursing students. Higher EI is associated with personal wellbeing and stress management, higher academic performance, stronger nursing leadership and practice performance, and greater patient safety. While there is an increasing body of evidence on nursing students' EI, there is minimal evidence on EI over time during pre-registration programs.\nTo measure EI in pre-registration nursing students from program commencement to conclusion to ascertain EI over time and examine the relationship between EI and academic performance.\nLongitudinal repeated measures study between March 2010-February 2013 at a metropolitan university in Australia.\n111 nursing students (74.8% female) contributed data on at least two occasions. Participants were enrolled in a pre-registration Master of Nursing degree. Half the cohort (55.0%) comprised Graduate Entry students who completed the course in two years full time. The other 45% were enrolled in an undergraduate degree in arts, science or health science, combined with the same pre-registration Master of Nursing Degree. These students completed their Combined Degree program in four years full time. Participants had a mean age of 24.7years (SD=7.36).\nEI was measured for commencing students (T1) using the Assessing Emotions Scale (AES), then a further three times: end of first year (T2; 9 months follow up); beginning of second year (12 months follow up; T3) and end of the program (T4; 24/36 months follow up).\nStudents' EI was found to increase across the program; one subscale of EI (managing others' emotions) was related to higher academic performance; and there was a significant increase in the Utilising Emotions subscale scores over time.\nPre-registration nurse education contributes to strengthening students' EI over time. Specific EI education scaffolded throughout programs is recommended in pre-registration curricula.", "Structured alphabets of DNA and RNA in their matrix form of representations are connected with Walsh functions and a new type of systems of multidimensional numbers. This type generalizes systems of complex numbers and hypercomplex numbers, which serve as the basis of mathematical natural sciences and many technologies. The new systems of multi-dimensional numbers have interesting mathematical properties and are called in a general case as \"systems of united-hypercomplex numbers\" (or briefly \"U-hypercomplex numbers\"). They can be widely used in models of multi-parametrical systems in the field of algebraic biology, artificial life, devices of biological inspired artificial intelligence, etc. In particular, an application of U-hypercomplex numbers reveals hidden properties of genetic alphabets under cyclic permutations in their doublets and triplets. A special attention is devoted to the author's hypothesis about a multi-linguistic in DNA-sequences in a relation with an ensemble of U-numerical sub-alphabets. Genetic multi-linguistic is considered as an important factor to provide noise-immunity properties of the multi-channel genetic coding. Our results attest to the conformity of the algebraic properties of the U-numerical systems with phenomenological properties of the DNA-alphabets and with the complementary device of the double DNA-helix. It seems that in the modeling field of algebraic biology the genetic-informational organization of living bodies can be considered as a set of united-hypercomplex numbers in some association with the famous slogan of Pythagoras \"the numbers rule the world\".", "Ralph Paffenbarger, Jr, MD, DrPH (1922-2007), was initially trained as an infectious disease epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health (now the Bloomberg School of Public Health). He was the first Epidemiology Intelligence Service officer in the first Epidemiology Intelligence Service class. He joined the National Heart Institute (now the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute) in its very early days and later became a faculty member at Stanford University and Harvard University. His studies of the relationships between physical activity (PA) and coronary heart disease in longshoremen and in college athletes at Harvard University and University of Pennsylvania, as well as the follow-up of the Harvard College students to evaluate PA both in and after college that was detailed in the article \"Physical Activity as an Index of Heart Attack Risk in College Alumni\" (Am J Epidemiol. 1978;108(3):161-175), established that more strenuous PA reduced the risk of heart attack and that it was necessary to continue PA after college. Results from his studies suggested that less strenuous PA had little effect on risk of heart attacks. He was a strong advocate for the importance of PA in the prevention of heart attacks and as a public health recommendation and for the idea that adherence to strenuous PA over the course of a lifetime was difficult. He was a marathon runner who competed frequently in the Boston Marathon and practiced what he preached.", "There is ample evidence for supporting the positive impact of aerobic fitness on cognitive function, but little is known about the physiological mechanisms. The objective of this study was to investigate whether the positive cognitive impact of aerobic fitness is associated with inflammatory and neurotrophic peripheral biomarkers in young adults aged 18 to 29years (n=87). For the objective assessment of aerobic fitness, we measured maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) as a parametric measure of cardiorespiratory capacity. We demonstrated that young adults with the higher levels of VO2max performed better on computerized cognitive tasks assessing sustained attention and working memory. This positive VO2max-cognitive performance association existed independently of confounders (e.g., years of education, intelligence scores) but was significantly dependent on resting peripheral blood levels of inflammatory (C-reactive protein, CRP) and neurotrophic (brain-derived neurotrophic factor, BDNF) biomarkers. Statistical models showed that CRP was a mediator of the effect of VO2max on working memory. Further, BDNF was a moderator of the effect of VO2max on working memory. These mediating and moderating effects occurred in individuals with higher levels of aerobic fitness. The results suggest that higher aerobic fitness, as measured by VO2max, is associated with enhanced cognitive functioning and favorable resting peripheral levels of inflammatory and brain-derived neurotrophic biomarkers in young adults.", "Accurate quantification of dissolved oxygen (DO) is critically important for managing water resources and controlling pollution. Artificial intelligence (AI) models have been successfully applied for modeling DO content in aquatic ecosystems with limited data. However, the efficacy of these AI models in predicting DO levels in the hypoxic river systems having multiple pollution sources and complicated pollutants behaviors is unclear. Given this dilemma, we developed a promising AI model, known as support vector machine (SVM), to predict the DO concentration in a hypoxic river in southeastern China. Four different calibration models, specifically, multiple linear regression, back propagation neural network, general regression neural network, and SVM, were established, and their prediction accuracy was systemically investigated and compared. A total of 11 hydro-chemical variables were used as model inputs. These variables were measured bimonthly at eight sampling sites along the rural-suburban-urban portion of Wen-Rui Tang River from 2004 to 2008. The performances of the established models were assessed through the mean square error (MSE), determination coefficient (R 2), and Nash-Sutcliffe (NS) model efficiency. The results indicated that the SVM model was superior to other models in predicting DO concentration in Wen-Rui Tang River. For SVM, the MSE, R 2, and NS values for the testing subset were 0.9416\u00a0mg/L, 0.8646, and 0.8763, respectively. Sensitivity analysis showed that ammonium-nitrogen was the most significant input variable of the proposal SVM model. Overall, these results demonstrated that the proposed SVM model can efficiently predict water quality, especially for highly impaired and hypoxic river systems.", "The sophistication, complexity and intelligence of biological systems is a continuous source of inspiration for mankind. Mimicking the natural intelligence to devise tiny systems that are capable of self-regulated, autonomous action to, for example, distinguish different targets, remains among the grand challenges in biomimetic micro-robotics. Herein, we demonstrate an autonomous soft device, a light-driven flytrap, that uses optical feedback to trigger photomechanical actuation. The design is based on light-responsive liquid-crystal elastomer, fabricated onto the tip of an optical fibre, which acts as a power source and serves as a contactless probe that senses the environment. Mimicking natural flytraps, this artificial flytrap is capable of autonomous closure and object recognition. It enables self-regulated actuation within the fibre-sized architecture, thus opening up avenues towards soft, autonomous small-scale devices.", "The literature is conflicted around the subject of the emotional abilities of individuals with Specific Learning Disabilities (SLDs): While many claim cognitive challenges are associated with emotional difficulties, some suggest emotional and interpersonal abilities are not compromised in such disorders and may help individuals compensate and cope effectively with the challenges they meet in learning environments. Two studies explored differences in emotional intelligence (EI) between young adults with and without SLD. Two samples (matched on gender, approximate age, and program of study; n = 100, and unmatched; n = 584) of college students took self-report and performance-based tests of EI (Ability-EI) as well as a measure of self-esteem and demographics associated with college performance (e.g.: SAT scores, gender, etc.). The results showed that while SAT scores and ability emotional intelligence (Ability-EI) were associated with college GPA, Ability-EI did not differ between the two groups, while self-report measures of EI and self-esteem did show differences, with the group with learning disabilities ranking lower. The effects remained stable when we controlled for demographics and potential intervening factors. The results suggest that EI may play a protective role in the association between background variables and college attainment in students with SLD. The results may provide a basis for interventions to empower students with SLD in academia.", "Organizational, methodological and technological paradigm changes enable a precise, personalized, predictive, preventive and participative approach to health and social services supported by multiple actors from different domains at diverse level of knowledge and skills. Interoperability has to advance beyond Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) concerns, including the real world business domains and their processes, but also the individual context of all actors involved. The paper introduces and compares personalized health definitions, summarizes requirements and principles for pHealth systems, and considers intelligent interoperability. It addresses knowledge representation and harmonization, decision intelligence, and usability as crucial issues in pHealth. On this basis, a system-theoretical, ontology-based, policy-driven reference architecture model for open and intelligent pHealth ecosystems and its transformation into an appropriate ICT design and implementation is proposed.", "The study of neuropsychological profiles and personality features of parents of persons with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) has highlighted specific traits that turned out to be useful for diagnostic purposes.\nIn our study, psychodiagnostic measures have been used to investigate cognitive profiles, personality features and familial relational patters in a group of parents of children with ASD associated to Intellectual Disability (ID). This group was then compared with a another group of parents of children with Prader-Willi syndrome.\nResults show no differences between the two groups with regard to Intellectual Quotient, while significant differences were found at the intelligence test Wechsler, which partially confirmed data from the literature relating to the performances of parents of persons with ASD. No differences were found in the executive functioning and memory abilities. As for familial relational patters, families of children with ASD showed decreased cohesion and higher disengagement.\nResults obtained in the domains of familial relational patterns and emotional personality components seem to confirm how children's disability can significantly impact on the entire household, in particular in the case of children with ASD. This data suggest the need for intervention programs aimed at supporting the entire household, with the objective of improving coping strategies and resilience resources of the family.", "The study objective was to evaluate the cognitive and psychosocial outcomes of young adults who underwent an arterial switch operation for transposition of the great arteries.\nSixty-seven adults with transposition of the great arteries (aged 22.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.3\u00a0years) and 43 healthy subjects matched in age, gender, and educational level participated. Global cognitive functioning, psychologic state, and health-related quality of life were evaluated using validated tools. We analyzed patient-related and procedure-related risk factors associated with cognitive and psychosocial outcomes.\nSome 69% of patients had an intelligence quotient greater than 85 (normal range, 85-115). Mean full-scale, verbal, and performance intelligence quotients were lower in patients (94.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a015.3, 96.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a016.2, 93.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a014.6, respectively) than in healthy subjects (103.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a012.3, P\u00a0=\u00a0.003; 102.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011.5, P\u00a0=\u00a0.033; 103.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a014.3, P\u00a0<\u00a0.001, respectively). Cognitive difficulties (intelligence quotient \u2264-1 standard deviation) and impairments (intelligence quotient \u2264-2 standard deviations) were more frequent in patients than in the general population (31% vs 16%, P\u00a0=\u00a0.001; 6% vs 2%, P\u00a0=\u00a0.030). Patients with cognitive difficulties had lower educational level (P\u00a0<\u00a0.001) and more grade retention at school (P\u00a0=\u00a0.007). Patients reported an overall satisfactory health-related quality of life; however, those with cognitive or psychologic difficulties reported poorer quality of life. Predictors of worse outcomes included lower parental socioeconomic and educational status, older age at surgery, and longer hospitalization stay.\nDespite satisfactory outcomes in most adults with transposition of the great arteries, a substantial proportion has cognitive or psychologic difficulties that may reduce their academic success and quality of life. Further studies are needed to better understand the long-term outcome of this population to provide prevention, surveillance, and care strategies.", "Concordance validity of commonly used performance validity tests (PVTs) was assessed in a sample of Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom/Operation New Dawn (OEF/OIF/OND) veterans referred to an mTBI screening clinic in a south-eastern Veterans Affairs hospital. Veteran service members (total n\u2009=\u2009184) completed the Rey-15, Repeatable Battery of the Assessment for Neuropsychological Status Effort Index (RBANS EI), and Reliable Digit Span (RDS) from the Wechsler Intelligence Scales. Kappa coefficients and percentage of agreement were established to determine the level of concordance between the three measures. PVT failure rate ranged from 7.4% of the sample (Rey-15) to 26.1% (RBANS EI Liberal). The highest concordance was found between the Rey 15 and RBANS EI \"highly suspicious\" cut-off, with the lowest agreement noted between all PVTs and the RBANS EI \"liberal\" cut-score. All concordance coefficients fell within the fair to moderate levels. Overall, the observed agreement between the explored measures was generally consistent with or greater than other studies of PVT concordance. Given the rates of concordance, the current results continue to suggest that PVTs are likely to measure a construct separate from the typical cognitive domains.", "Chemotherapy, target therapy, and immunotherapy are increasingly being used in the systematic treatment of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), during which the occurrence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation might increase. However, data regarding HBV screening and reactivation and the clinical management of NPC patients with HBV infections are lacking. This study was aimed at clarifying the risk of reactivation for NPC patients on different regimens while providing evidence concerning HBV screening and management in an endemic area.\nWith the NPC database from an established big-data intelligence platform at Sun Yat-Sen University Cancer Center in China, NPC patients who were diagnosed between 2008 and 2016 and underwent HBV screening and regular monitoring of liver enzymes and HBV deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) were analyzed.\nAmong the 46,919 patients identified, the HBV screening rate was 24.8% (11,616 of 46,919). Among the screened patients with an HBV infection, regular monitoring of liver enzymes and HBV DNA occurred for 563 patients. The incidence of HBV reactivation and HBV-related hepatitis was 9.1% (51 of 563) and 2.5% (14 of 563), respectively. The reactivation risk varied for different treatments and regimens and ranged from 0.0% to 21.4%. Detectable baseline HBV DNA (odds ratio [OR], 2.93; P < .01), the presence of liver metastasis at diagnosis (OR, 7.19; P < .01), and antiviral prophylaxis (OR, 0.29; P < .01) were significantly associated with reactivation.\nIn NPC patients with chronic HBV infections on high-risk regimens, the reactivation risk is similar to or exceeds the risk associated with other immunosuppressive therapies for which screening and prophylaxis are recommended. Our findings, therefore, support HBV screening and prophylaxis for these patients, whereas regular monitoring might be appropriate for patients with resolved HBV infections or those receiving low-risk regimens.

However, it remains unclear whether the white matter tracts connecting these structures are impaired in schizophrenia. Our study investigated the integrity of these white matter tracts (vPCC-MTG tract) and their asymmetry (left versus right side) in patients with recent onset schizophrenia.\nForty-seven patients and 24 age-and sex-matched healthy controls were enrolled in this study. We extracted left and right vPCC-MTG tract on each side from T1W and diffusion MRI (dMRI) at 3T. We then calculated the asymmetry index of diffusion measures of vPCC-MTG tracts as well as volume and thickness of vPCC and MTG using the formula: 2\u00d7(right-left)/(right+left). We compared asymmetry indices between patients and controls and evaluated their correlations with the severity of psychiatric symptoms and cognition in patients using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), video-based social cognition scale (VISC) and the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS-III).\nAsymmetry of fractional anisotropy (FA) and radial diffusivity (RD) in the vPCC-MTG tract, while present in healthy controls, was not evident in schizophrenia patients. Also, we observed that patients, not healthy controls, had a significant FA decrease and RD increase in the left vPCC-MTG tract. There was no significant association between the asymmetry indices of dMRI measures and IQ, VISC, or PANSS scores in schizophrenia.\nDisruption of asymmetry of the vPCC-MTG tract in schizophrenia may contribute to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.", "Many constructs that we take for granted in modern neuropsychology, fluid intelligence among them, can best be explained by conceptionalizing them as a collection of task specific processes engaged in by an integrated recruited network involved in problem solving. Fractionalizing the network in an attempt to describe elements of its function leads to arbitrarily defined segments that may be interesting to discuss abstractly, but never occur independently in the real world operation of the system. We will seek to demonstrate that the construct of fluid intelligence is like that. It is a description of a type of operation of a network dedicated to solving problems and the composition of the network that is responsible for the activity changes in a task specific manner. As a result, fluid intelligence is not an independent skill, or a thing that lives on its own, or can be measured independently of the other things that contribute to the overall operation of the network as it seeks to solve problems.", "The structure of neurocognition is explored by examining the neurocognitive domains underlying comprehensive neuropsychological assessment of cognitively healthy individuals.\nExploratory factor analysis was conducted on the adult normative dataset of an expanded Halstead-Reitan Battery (eHRB), comprising Caucasian and African American participants. The factor structure contributions of the original HRB, eHRB expansion, and Wechsler intelligence scales were compared. Demographic effects were examined on composite factor scores calculated using confirmatory factor analysis.\nThe full eHRB had an eight-factor structure, with latent constructs including: 'working memory', 'fluency', 'verbal episodic memory', 'visuospatial cognition' (visuospatial memory and problem solving), 'perceptual-motor speed' (speed for processing visual/tactile material and hand-motor execution), 'perceptual attention' (attention to sensory-perceptual information), 'semantic knowledge' (knowledge acquired through education and culturally-based experiences), and 'phonological decoding' (grapheme-phoneme processing essential for sounding-out words). 'Perceptual-motor speed' and 'perceptual attention' were most negatively associated with age, whereas 'semantic knowledge' and 'phonological decoding' were most resistant to aging. 'Semantic knowledge' showed the greatest dependence on demographic background, including education and ethnicity. Gender differences in cognitive performances were negligible across all domains except 'phonological decoding' with women slightly outperforming men. The original HRB contributed four neurocognitive domains, the eHRB expansion three domains, and the Wechsler scales one additional domain but with restructuring of verbal factors.\nEight neurocognitive domains underlie performance of healthy cognitive individuals during comprehensive neuropsychological assessment. These domains serve as framework for understanding the constructs measured by commonly-used neuropsychological tests and may represent the structure of neurocognition.", "Despite treatment with virologically suppressive antiretroviral therapy (ART), neurocognitive impairment may persist or develop de novo in aging HIV-infected individuals. We evaluated advancing age as a predictor of neurocognitive impairment in a large cohort of previously ART-naive individuals on long-term ART.\nThe AIDS Clinical Trials Group Longitudinal Linked Randomized Trials was a prospective cohort study of HIV-infected individuals originally enrolled in randomized ART trials. This analysis examined neurocognitive outcomes at least 2 years after ART initiation.\nAll participants underwent annual neurocognitive testing consisting of Trail making A and B, the wechsler adult intelligence scale-revised Digit Symbol and Hopkins Verbal Learning Tests. Uni and multivariable repeated measures regression models evaluated factors associated with neurocognitive performance. Predictors at parent study entry (ART naive) included entry demographics, smoking, injection drug use, hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C virus serostatus, history of stroke, ART regimen type, pre-ART nadir CD4 cell count, and plasma viral load and as well as time-updated plasma viral load and CD4 cell count.\nThe cohort comprised 3313 individuals with median pre-ART age of 38 years, 20% women; 36% Black, non-Hispanic; 22% Hispanic. Virologic suppression was maintained at 91% of follow-up visits. Neurocognitive performance improved with years of ART. After adjusting for the expected effects of age using norms from HIV-negative individuals, the odds of neurocognitive impairment at follow-up visits among the HIV infected increased by nearly 20% for each decade of advancing age.\nDespite continued virologic suppression and neurocognitive improvement in the cohort as a whole, older individuals were more likely to have neurocognitive impairment than younger individuals.", "We previously showed that potential prenatal exposure to agricultural pesticides was associated with adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes in children, yet the effects of joint exposure to multiple pesticides is poorly understood. In this paper, we investigate associations between the joint distribution of agricultural use patterns of multiple pesticides (denoted as \"pesticide profiles\") applied near maternal residences during pregnancy and Full-Scale Intelligence Quotient (FSIQ) at 7 years of age. Among a cohort of children residing in California's Salinas Valley, we used Pesticide Use Report (PUR) data to characterize potential exposure from use within 1 km of maternal residences during pregnancy for 15 potentially neurotoxic pesticides from five different chemical classes. We used Bayesian profile regression (BPR) to examine associations between clustered pesticide profiles and deficits in childhood FSIQ. BPR identified eight distinct clusters of prenatal pesticide profiles. Two of the pesticide profile clusters exhibited some of the highest cumulative pesticide use levels and were associated with deficits in adjusted FSIQ of -6.9 (95% credible interval: -11.3, -2.2) and -6.4 (95% credible interval: -13.1, 0.49), respectively, when compared with the pesticide profile cluster that showed the lowest level of pesticides use. Although maternal residence during pregnancy near high agricultural use of multiple neurotoxic pesticides was associated with FSIQ deficit, the magnitude of the associations showed potential for sub-additive effects. Epidemiologic analysis of pesticides and their potential health effects can benefit from a multi-pollutant approach to analysis.", "Business owners are faced with complex problems and are required to make decisions on a daily basis. The purpose of this study was to investigate complex problem solving (CPS) between experts and novices and to explore the competing theories of expert-rigidity versus expert-adaptability, as part of exploring which theory better explains crystallized intelligence. Participants were 140 business owners, business management undergraduate students and psychology students. Each participant managed a highly complex simulated chocolate company. Decisions and systems data were automatically saved in log files. Results revealed that small business owners performed best, followed by business students and then psychology students. A process analysis revealed that experts compared to novices spent more time initially exploring the complex situation. Experts were found to have greater flexibility in their decisions, having made the most personnel and advertising changes in response to situational demands. Adaptability and flexibility were predictive of performance, with results supporting the adaptability/flexibility theory of expertise. This study shows the influence of expertise on complex problem solving and the importance of flexibility when solving dynamic business problems. Complex business simulations are not only useful tools for research, but could also be used as tools in training programs teaching decision making and problem solving strategies.", "Objective Children with migrant background learning German as second language are frequently considered having problems in speech comprehension and speaking; nevertheless, it is very difficult to objectify that for young children. For this purpose risk-factors should be determined empirically. Material and Methods The study comprised 126 children from a developmental longitudinal study in 7 day-care centers in Frankfurt/M and Darmstadt. The sample was sorted into two extreme groups by their achievement in oral German language comprehension: criterion T-score \u226546=age appropriate (N=61) vs. T-score \u226432=poor (N=65). The study used an assumed best-subtests variable-selection (intelligence; grammatical based comprehension; verbal conceptualization; recognition of semantic and grammatical inconsistencies) to examine risk-factors for the quality of development in German as second language. Results Intelligence was average in both groups, however, significantly different (T-score=54.1; SD 6.7 vs. T-score=42.2; SD 8.8; p<0,001). Risk-factors for a separation between rather convenient and less convenient conditions for the development of German as second language could be identified by applying discriminant analyses (in order of descending magnitude): intelligence; recognition of verbal inconsistencies; mother's level of education; grammatical based comprehension. Regarding the group affiliation, 88% of the children with poor and 84% of those with age appropriate oral comprehension could be correctly classified within the selected samples. Conclusions The results provide an acceptable standard to distinguish migrant children with an age appropriate oral comprehension in German as the second language from such with a poorer one.\nHintergrund Kinder mit Migrationshintergrund und Deutsch als Zweitsprache (DaZ) gelten h\u00e4ufig als sprachauff\u00e4llig, was jedoch mangels fehlender Untersuchungsinstrumente im jungen Alter schwer zu objektivieren ist. Hierf\u00fcr sollten empirisch Risikofaktoren bestimmt werden. Material und Methoden Aus dem Datenpool einer Entwicklungsl\u00e4ngsschnittstudie in 7 Kitas in Frankfurt/M. u.

As social knowledge of creativity may either enhance or 'offset' the appeal of social partners who differ in physical attractiveness, three repeated measures experiments were conducted to directly address these issues. Here, participants rated a series of face-text pairs for attractiveness on trials that differed in one of four combinations of facial attractiveness (attractive and less attractive) and creativity (creative and less creative), rating story-tellers in two experiments (short interpretations of an identical painting) and creative ideas in a further experiment (alternative uses for an everyday object). Regardless of the sex of the judge, creativity and facial attractiveness had independent effects on men's overall attractiveness (initial experiment) and, in further experiments, more substantial effects on the attractiveness of men with less attractive faces than men with attractive faces (when using a different measure of creativity) and specific effects on the attractiveness of individuals with less attractive faces (when using different face stimuli). Collectively, across three experiments, these findings suggest that creativity may compensate for putative cues to lower biological 'quality' and that the benefits of creativity to social groups more generally enhance attraction to creative men (in two experiments) and creative men and women (one experiment). More broadly, the data suggest that species can integrate knowledge of cognitive intelligence with visual cues to biological 'quality' to facilitate mate and/or ally choice.", "Individuals with cervical spinal cord injury (SCI) have impaired thermoregulatory mechanisms attributed to interruption of motor, sensory, and autonomic neuropathways. To determine the effects of heat exposure on core body temperature (Tcore) and cognitive performance in persons with tetraplegia, 8 individuals with chronic tetraplegia (C3-C7, American Spinal Cord Injury Association Impairment Scale A-B) and 9 able-bodied controls were acclimated to 27\u00b0C at baseline (BL) before being exposed to 35\u00b0C for up to 120\u2009min (Heat Challenge). Rectal temperature (Tcore), distal skin temperatures (Tskavg), sweat rate (QSavg), microvascular skin perfusion (LDFavg), and plasma norepinephrine (NE) were measured. Cognitive performance was assessed using Stroop Color and Word and Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Fourth Edition Digit Span tests at BL and at the end of Heat Challenge. After Heat Challenge, Tcore increased 0.78\u2009\u00b1\u20090.18\u00b0C (p\u2009<\u20090.001) in tetraplegics after an average of 118\u2009\u00b1\u20095\u2009min. Tcore did not change in controls after 120\u2009min. The increase in QSavg was larger in controls than in tetraplegics (946\u2009\u00b1\u2009672% vs. 51\u2009\u00b1\u200912%; p\u2009=\u20090.007, respectively). LDFavg increased only in controls (109\u2009\u00b1\u200993%; p\u2009=\u20090.008). Tskavg appeared to increase less in tetraplegics than in controls. Plasma NE levels remained lower in tetraplegics compared to controls after Heat Challenge (86\u2009\u00b1\u200964 vs. 297\u2009\u00b1\u200984\u2009pg/mL, respectively; p\u2009<\u20090.001). Stroop Color, Interference, and WAIS-IV Sequence scores increased only in tetraplegics (19.4\u2009\u00b1\u200917.2%; p\u2009<\u20090.05, 8.3\u2009\u00b1\u20095.9%; p\u2009<\u20090.05, 29.1\u2009\u00b1\u200927.4%; p\u2009<\u20090.05, respectively). Dysfunctional thermoregulatory mechanisms in the tetraplegic group allowed Tcore to rise from subnormal levels to normothermia during heat exposure. Normothermia was associated with improvements in attention, working memory, and executive function.", "Little is known about the neurodevelopmental outcomes of children older than 3 years of age born to HIV infected mother but who are HIV-uninfected (HEU), and who have been exposed in utero and early in life to HIV and to antiretroviral medications (ARVs). We conducted a longitudinal study of cognitive, visuomotor and adaptive function of HEU children, who were assessed at two ages, 3.5 and 5.5 years. Sixty-four children (33 female) were assessed. In comparison with population norms for their age, at 3.5 years of age they had scores significantly below age expectations on aspects of adaptive behavior, but at age 5.5 years, their scores did not significantly diverge from the population norms on any of the measures. Verbal intelligence was lower at age 5.5 than at age 3.5 years, although there were also improvements in some features of adaptive behavior. Exposure to PI-based ARVs (compared to NNRTIs) was associated with higher Performance IQ, visuomotor and communication scores at age 5.5 years. Birth, early growth, and sociodemographic variables were predictive of outcomes. This study is important in tracking the trajectory of neurocognitive development across the pre-school and early school age years. The findings suggest that the full impact of early ARV exposure may not be evident until a considerable period of development has occurred. The results raise the possibility of negative effects of early ARV exposure on neurodevelopment that emerge over time, and reiterate the importance of sociodemographic and early health variables for optimal development.", "Years of research in software engineering has given us novel ways to reason about, test, and predict the behavior of complex software systems that contain hundreds of thousands of lines of code. Many of these techniques have been inspired by nature such as genetic algorithms, swarm intelligence, and ant colony optimization. In this paper we reverse the direction and present BioSIMP, a process that models and predicts the behavior of biological organisms to aid in the emerging field of systems biology. It utilizes techniques from testing and modeling of highly-configurable software systems. Using both experimental and simulation data we show that BioSIMP can find important environmental factors in two microbial organisms. However, we learn that in order to fully reason about the complexity of biological systems, we will need to extend existing or create new software engineering techniques.", "Nutritional deficiency anaemia can lead to development of headache, fatigue, lethargy, apathy, exertional dyspnoea, palpitations and tinnitus and thereby decrease the quality of everyday life to a great extent. Such symptoms may pose a hindrance for students in their academic life and have a negative impact on their career.\nTo determine prevalence of nutritional deficiency anaemia and its correlation with academic performance among medical students.\nA cross-sectional study was conducted at Adichunchanagiri Institute of Medical Sciences. Two hundred eighty nine healthy undergraduate medical students of both genders were included in this study. A predesigned and pre-structured questionnaire was used as a tool to obtain information regarding demographic profile, dietary habits and academic performance. Haemoglobin level was estimated. Student's t-test and Chi-square test were employed.\nMajority of the participants were within the age group of 17-20 years (84.4%). The overall prevalence of anaemia was 15.6% with high rates among female students (93.3%), this gender difference was statistically significant (p<0.001). There was statistically significant difference in Hb% (p=0.009) among high and low performers. There was no association between the anaemic status and students scholastic performance (\u03c72=3.1533, p=0.368).\nThe mean haemoglobin level was higher among low performer, indicating that nutritional anaemia may not \\play a major role in educational performance and intelligence in higher education.", "Due to scientific and technological development, Medical Education has been readjusting its focus and strategies.

However, it is unclear which specific visuoperceptual subprocesses are impaired and whether impairments on these tasks really result from visuoperceptual impairments or rather from confounding factors like Executive Functioning (EF) impairments, lower intelligence (IQ) and/or co-occurring symptoms of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). To answer these questions, we administered four visuoperceptual tasks and two control tasks in 39 children with NF1, 52 typically developing children and 52 children with ASD (8-18 years), all matched for age and gender. Furthermore, EF, IQ, and symptoms of ASD were assessed. Children with NF1 displayed intact visual form discrimination and intact information integration along the dorsal visual pathway. Moreover, their reduced performance on a task requiring integration of information along the ventral visual stream and their more detail-oriented processing style appeared to result from confounding EF impairments and not from visuoperceptual impairments per se. The co-occurring ASD symptoms and lower IQ of the children with NF1 did not impact substantially upon their visuoperceptual performance. These findings point to the large impact of EF impairments on the performance of visuoperceptual task and suggest that individuals with NF1 show intact visual form discrimination, intact visual integration, and typical visual processing style when potential confounding factors are controlled for. This may have large repercussions for the interpretation of other findings on visuoperceptual processing in individuals with NF1. \u00a9 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.", "The effects of regular practice of martial arts is considered controversial and studies in this field limited their attention to singular psychological benefits. The aim of this study is to examine the relationship between the regular practice of martial arts and cognitive and personality factors, such as: attention, creativity and school performance, together with, self-esteem, self-efficacy and aggression.\nThe design consists in a factorial design with two independent variables (groups and age levels) and seven dependent variables (attention, creativity, intelligence, school performance, self-esteem, self-efficacy and aggression). Seventy-six people practicing martial arts were compared with a control group (70 participants) not involved in any martial arts training. Martial artists were divided into groups of three levels of experience: beginners, intermediate and experts. Each completed a battery of tests that measured all the cognitive and personality factors.\nMartial artists presented a better performance in the attentional and creativity tests. All the personality factors analyzed presented a significant difference between the two groups, resulting in higher levels of self-esteem and self-efficacy, and a decrease of aggressiveness.\nRegular practice of martial arts can influence many functional aspects, leading to positive effects on both personality and cognitive factors, with implications in psychological well-being, and in the educational field. The results were discussed with reference to theories claiming that regular activity has a differential positive effect on some aspects of cognition.", "Although our world is hierarchically organized, the perception, attention, and memory of hierarchical structures remain largely unknown. The current study shows how a hierarchical motion representation enhances the inference of an object's position in a dynamic display. The motion hierarchy is formed as an acyclic tree in which each node represents a distinctive motion component. Each individual object is instantiated as a node in the tree. In a position inference task, participants were asked to infer the position of a target object, given how it moved jointly with other objects. The results showed that the inference is supported by the context formed by nontarget objects. More importantly, this contextual effect is (a) structured, with stronger support from objects forming a hierarchical tree than from those moving independently; (b) degreed, with stronger support from objects closer to the target in the motion tree; and (c) directed, with stronger support from the target's ancestor nodes than from its descendent nodes. Computational modeling results further indicated that the contextual effect cannot be explained by correlated and contingent movements without an explicit causal representation of the motion hierarchy. Together, these studies suggest that human vision is a type of intelligence, which sees what are in the dynamic displays by recovering why and how they are generated. (PsycINFO Database Record", "Healthy ageing has disparate effects on different cognitive domains. The neural basis of these differences, however, is largely unknown. We investigated this question by using Independent Components Analysis to obtain functional brain components from 98 healthy participants aged 23-87 years from the population-based Cam-CAN cohort. Participants performed two cognitive tasks that show age-related decrease (fluid intelligence and object naming) and a syntactic comprehension task that shows age-related preservation. We report that activation of task-positive neural components predicts inter-individual differences in performance in each task across the adult lifespan. Furthermore, only the two tasks that show performance declines with age show age-related decreases in task-positive activation of neural components and decreasing default mode (DM) suppression. Our results suggest that distributed, multi-component brain responsivity supports cognition across the adult lifespan, and the maintenance of this, along with maintained DM deactivation, characterizes successful ageing and may explain differential ageing trajectories across cognitive domains.", "Electroencephalographic abnormalities may occur in autistic spectrum disorders (ASD) even in the absence of clinical seizures. These abnormalities may vary from nonspecific changes to epileptiform abnormalities and are more common compared to the overall population. The level of intelligence is a significant risk factor for epilepsy in ASD. However, the relation between the functionality of the individuals with autism and the electroencephalographic (EEG) abnormalities, and the clinical significance of these abnormalities still remain relatively unclear. In this study we investigated the presence of EEG abnormalities in sixteen children diagnosed with high-functioning ASD. EEG recording was performed for at least 2\u00a0h and included at least 90\u00a0min of sleep activity. While none of the patients had clinical seizures, 5 patients (31.3%) were detected to have EEG abnormalities. Four of these were epileptiform (25%), and one patient developed seizure during follow-up. Our results support the fact that EEG abnormalities are observed at a higher rate also in ASD with a better functionality. The potential impact of EEG abnormalities on cognition and behavior, and the risk of epilepsy should be considered during long-term follow-up of these patients.", "Intelligence is defined for wild plants and its role in fitness identified. Intelligent behaviour exhibited by single cells and systems similarity between the interactome and connectome indicates neural systems are not necessary for intelligent capabilities. Plants sense and respond to many environmental signals that are assessed to competitively optimize acquisition of patchily distributed resources. Situations of choice engender motivational states in goal-directed plant behaviour; consequent intelligent decisions enable efficient gain of energy over expenditure. Comparison of swarm intelligence and plant behaviour indicates the origins of plant intelligence lie in complex communication and is exemplified by cambial control of branch function. Error correction in behaviours indicates both awareness and intention as does the ability to count to five. Volatile organic compounds are used as signals in numerous plant interactions. Being complex in composition and often species and individual specific, they may represent the plant language and account for self and alien recognition between individual plants. Game theory has been used to understand competitive and cooperative interactions between plants and microbes. Some unexpected cooperative behaviour between individuals and potential aliens has emerged. Behaviour profiting from experience, another simple definition of intelligence, requires both learning and memory and is indicated in the priming of herbivory, disease and abiotic stresses.", "Several heuristic, biologically inspired strategies have been discovered in recent decades, including swarm intelligence algorithms. So far, their application to volumetric imaging data mining is, however, limited. This paper presents a new flexible swarm intelligence optimization technique for segmentation of various structures in three- or two-dimensional images. The agents of a self-organizing colony explore their host, use stigmergy to communicate themselves, and mark regions of interest leading to the object extraction. Detailed specification of the bacterium colony segmentation (BCS) technique in terms of both individual and social behaviour is described in this paper. The method is illustrated and evaluated using several experiments involving synthetic data, computed tomography studies, and ultrasonography images. The obtained results and observations are discussed in terms of parameter settings and potential application of the method in various segmentation tasks.", "William Friedman (1891-1969), trained as a plant geneticist at Cornell University, was employed at Riverbank Laboratories by the eccentric millionaire George Fabyan to work on wheat breeding. Friedman, however, soon became intrigued by and started working on a pet project of Fabyan's involving the conjecture that Francis Bacon, a polymath known for the study of ciphers, was the real author of Shakespeare's plays. Thus, beginning in \u223c1916, Friedman turned his attention to the so called \"Baconian cipher,\" and developed decryption techniques that bore similarity to approaches for solving problems in population genetics. His most significant, indeed pathbreaking, work used ideas from genetics and statistics, focusing on analysis of the frequencies of letters in language use. Although he had transitioned from being a geneticist to a cryptographer, his earlier work had resonance in his later pursuits. He soon began working directly for the United States government and produced solutions used to solve complex military ciphers, in particular to break the Japanese Purple code during World War II. Another important legacy of his work was the establishment of the Signal Intelligence Service and eventually the National Security Agency.", "For the first time in China, the inorganic element profiling of cocaine specimens was performed at the National Narcotics Laboratory. An inductive coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) method was developed and validated for simultaneous analysis of 26 inorganic elements, including sodium (Na), magnesium (Mg), aluminuim (Al), potassium (K), calcium (Ca), vanadium (V), chromium (Cr), manganese (Mn), iron (Fe), cobalt (Co), nickel (Ni), copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), arsenic (As), selenium (Se), molybdenum (Mo), silver (Ag), cadmium (Cd), antimony (Sb), barium (Ba), lanthanum (La), cerium (Ce), thallium (Tl), lead (Pb), thorium (Th), and uranium (U) in illicit cocaine samples. Ultrasonic assisted dissolution was applied for sample preparation. Minimum sample preparation and analysis time were required, which was suitable for routine analysis. After the analysis of 183 cocaine samples seized from 2011 to 2015, the element concentration ranges of cocaine sample were obtained. Based on the quantitative data set of 26 inorganic elements in 131 linked/un-linked cocaine samples, fifty combinations of pre-treatment methods and distance/correlation measurements were tested for their potential discrimination power for cocaine profiling, and normalization+standardization+logarithm (N+S+L)/Cosine correlation exhibited the best result. After hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) analysis of 183 cocaine samples, 21 groups of linked samples were found within and between provinces, which provide intelligence for case connection and revealing of the distribution networks.", "To investigate the relationship between executive functioning and social and perinatal risk factors in four- to five-year-old preterm children.\nUsing standardised measures of general intelligence and performance-based executive function (EF) tests prior to starting kindergarten, 141 children born preterm (<33 weeks of gestation) and 77 term comparison children were assessed. Parental and teacher reports of executive functioning were completed when the children commenced kindergarten. The preterm and the term comparison groups were compared on measures of intelligence and EFs using independent-groups t-tests, and multivariate regression analyses were performed to identify factors predictive of intelligence and executive functioning in the preterm group.\nThe preterm group performed significantly more poorly than the comparison group on all intelligence and EF tests. The parental reports of the preterm and term comparison children's EF did not differ significantly, but the teachers reported elevated EF difficulties for the preterm group. Higher social risk, in particular lower educational level of the main caregiver, was the strongest predictor for the preterm children's intelligence and EF results.\nSocial risk factors are strongly associated with impaired early EF outcomes in preterm children.", "Traditional perspectives have envisaged intelligence as one entity dominated by a single set of abilities (i.e. cognitive abilities), whereas modern perspectives have defined intelligence in various shapes (e.g. linguistic, musical and interpersonal intelligences). By the same token, traditional perspectives have examined stupidity as one set of inabilities (i.e. cognitive inabilities). However, it is not clear whether modern perspectives have discussed whether stupidity exists in various forms-in the same way as they have envisaged intelligence. To address this limitation, 257 university members were asked to share what they perceived as being stupid educational and technological practices in their institutions. Analysis of the data suggested three concepts were important to the members: moral, spatial and administrative stupidities. That is, stupidity is perceived to come in the form of failing to meet certain moral, spatial and administrative values. This implies that modern perspectives may conceptualise stupidity differently from traditional perspectives, seeing it as going beyond cognitive inabilities and viewing it as existing in various forms (e.g. moral, spatial and administrative stupidities). Thus, there are multiple stupidities as there are multiple forms of intelligence. A strength of this research is that it views stupidity through an organisational and qualitative lens, although some may traditionally expect such a topic to be examined quantitatively through psychometric and biological approaches.", "BackgroundMaternal pre-pregnancy obesity may impair infant neuropsychological development, but it is unclear whether intrauterine or confounding factors drive this association.MethodsWe assessed whether maternal pre-pregnancy obesity was associated with neuropsychological development in 1,827 Spanish children. At 5 years, cognitive and psychomotor development was assessed using McCarthy Scales of Children's Abilities, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms using the Criteria of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, and autism spectrum disorder symptoms using the Childhood Asperger Syndrome Test. Models were adjusted for sociodemographic factors and maternal intelligence quotient. We used paternal obesity as negative control exposure as it involves the same source of confounding than maternal obesity.ResultsThe percentage of obese mothers and fathers was 8% and 12%, respectively. In unadjusted models, children of obese mothers had lower scores than children of normal weight mothers in all McCarthy subscales. After adjustment, only the verbal subscale remained statistically significantly reduced (\u03b2: -2.8; 95% confidence interval: -5.3, -0.2). No associations were observed among obese fathers. Maternal and paternal obesity were associated with an increase in ADHD-related symptoms. Parental obesity was not associated with autism symptoms.ConclusionMaternal pre-pregnancy obesity was associated with a reduction in offspring verbal scores at pre-school age.", "The study of evolutionary patterns of cognitive convergence would be greatly helped by a clear demarcation of cognition. Cognition is often used as an equivalent of mind, making it difficult to pin down empirically or to apply it confidently beyond the human condition. Recent developments in embodied cognition and philosophy of biology now suggest an interpretation that dissociates cognition from this mental context. Instead, it anchors cognition in a broad range of biological cases of intelligence, provisionally marked by a basic cognitive toolkit. This conception of cognition as an empirically based phenomenon provides a suitable and greatly expanded domain for studies of evolutionary convergence. This paper first introduces this wide, biologically embodied interpretation of cognition. Second, it discusses examples drawn from studies on bacteria, plants and fungi that all provide cases fulfilling the criteria for this wide interpretation. Third, the field of early nervous system evolution is used to illustrate how biologically embodied cognition raises new fundamental questions for research on animal cognition. Finally, an outline is given of the implications for the evolutionary convergence of cognition.", "The aim of our study was to examine whether the findings from previous research, indicating the role of short-term memory as a mediator of the relationship between motor coordination and academic achievement in adolescents, is also evident in a younger child population.\nThe study utilized a quantative cross-sectional design involving 133 children aged 8-12. The McCarron Assessment of Neuromuscular Development (MAND) provided four indicators of psychomotor ability (Finger Nose, Walking, Balancing, and Jumping). The Woodcock-Johnson Cognitive battery and the Automated Working Memory Assessment (AWMA) provided two measures of short-term memory (Numbers Reversed and Digit Recall) and the WJIII Achievement battery provided two measures of reading achievement (Letter-word Identification and Passage Comprehension) and two measures of mathematics achievement (Applied Problems and Calculation). Structural equation modeling was used, controlling for age, processing speed, crystallized, and fluid intelligence where appropriate.\nThe results found support for the hypothesis that short-term memory fully mediates the relationship between psychomotor ability and reading and mathematics achievement.\nThese findings indicate the significant affect of psychomotor ability on learning outcomes and consequently the need to assess these in considering learning difficulties, and as such these findings also advance understanding of developmental neural mechanisms underpinning the relationships.", "Does fertility treatment influence cognitive ability in school aged children, and does the impact vary with the type of treatment?\nThe available high-quality evidence indicates that specific treatments may give rise to different effects on cognitive development, with certain treatments, including ICSI, associated with cognitive impairment.\nPrevious reviews of the literature concerning cognitive outcomes among children conceived with medical assistance have concluded that study findings are generally 'reassuring', but limited attention has been paid to the quality of this research. In addition, no review has separately assessed the range of treatment modalities available, which vary in invasiveness, and thus, potentially, in their effects on developmental outcomes.\nA systematic review was undertaken. We searched PubMed, PsycINFO and the Educational Resources Information Centre database to identify English-language studies published up until 21 November 2016.\nTwo authors independently reviewed identified articles, extracted data and assessed study quality. Studies were eligible if they assessed cognitive development from age 4 years or more, among children conceived with fertility treatment compared with either children conceived naturally or children born from a different type of fertility treatment. Where available, data were extracted and reported separately according to the various components of treatment (e.g. mode of fertilization, embryo freezing, etc.). Risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale, with a score \u22657/9 indicative of high quality.\nThe search identified 861 articles, of which 35 were included. Of these, seven were rated high quality. Most studies (n = 22) were subject to selection bias, due to the exclusion of children at increased risk of cognitive impairment. Among high-quality studies, there was no difference in cognitive outcomes among children conceived with conventional\u00a0IVF and those conceived naturally. Findings among high-quality studies of children conceived with\u00a0ICSI were inconsistent: when compared with children conceived naturally, one study reported lower intelligence quotient (IQ; 5-7 points, on average) among ICSI children whereas the remaining two high-quality studies reported no difference between groups. Furthermore, among the three high-quality studies comparing children conceived with ICSI compared with conventional IVF, one reported a significant increase in the risk of mental retardation, one reported a small difference in IQ (3 points lower, on average) and one no difference at all. There were scant studies examining exposure to embryo freezing, or less invasive treatments such as ovulation induction without IVF/ICSI.\nMost existing studies had methodological limitations including selection bias and/or failure to address confounding by family background. In addition, a meta-analysis could not be performed due to heterogeneity in the assessment of cognitive outcomes. These factors impeded our ability to synthesize the evidence and draw reliable conclusions.\nThe conflicting findings among studies of children conceived with ICSI require clarification, in light of the increasing use of this technique for reasons other than male-factor infertility. Further population-based studies are needed that utilize contemporary data to examine specific aspects of treatment and combinations of techniques (e.g. ICSI with frozen embryo cycles). Importantly, studies should include the complete group of children exposed to treatment.\nA.R.R. is supported by a Career Development Fellowship from the National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia.

Toward this end, WM training protocols aim to improve WM capacity and extend improvements to unpracticed domains, yet success is limited. One emerging approach is to couple WM training with transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). This pairing of WM training with tDCS in longitudinal designs promotes behavioral improvement and evidence of transfer of performance gains to untrained WM tasks. However, the mechanism(s) underlying tDCS-linked training benefits remain unclear. Our goal was to gain purchase on this question by recording high-density EEG before and after a weeklong WM training+tDCS study. Participants completed four sessions of frontoparietal tDCS (active anodal or sham) during which they performed a visuospatial WM change detection task. Participants who received active anodal tDCS demonstrated significant improvement on the WM task, unlike those who received sham stimulation. Importantly, this pattern was mirrored by neural correlates in spectral and phase synchrony analyses of the HD-EEG data. Notably, the behavioral interaction was echoed by interactions in frontal-posterior alpha band power, and theta and low alpha oscillations. These findings indicate that one mechanism by which paired tDCS+WM training operates is to enhance cortical efficiency and connectivity in task-relevant networks.", "A growing line of research has sought to characterize the different presentations of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) among boys and girls. Much less is known about maternal experience and mother-child relationship in children with ASD based on child gender. The present qualitative study aimed to investigate the mother-daughter relationship from the perspective of mothers who are raising girls with ASD with normal intelligence and functional verbal communication.\nEleven in-depth interviews were conducted with mothers of girls with ASD, ages 10-19\u00a0years. Data were analysed in an interactive process commonly used in naturalistic inquiry. Results provide insight into the unique maternal experience of raising a daughter with ASD.\nMothers reported a sense of exclusion from the neurotypical population and male-dominant ASD population and transformation in relationship. Themes identified were skepticism and delayed diagnosis, disbelief from others, lack of information about girls with ASD, higher social demands in adolescence, puberty challenges around hygiene, disappointment about physical appearance, vulnerability in relationships and worries about future functioning. The mother-daughter relationship started with an early expectation of a close and intimate relationship that then underwent a transformation, which challenged maternal competence, reshaped expectations and created a different bond between mother and daughter.\nThe findings in this qualitative study highlight the impact of gender on the maternal experience of raising a daughter with ASD and contribute to a better understanding of the needs of both mothers and daughters. These results can help providers support the mother-daughter dyad by recognizing gender-specific challenges.", "Syntactic priming, the phenomenon in which participants adopt the linguistic behaviour of their partner, is widely used in psycholinguistics to investigate syntactic operations. Although the phenomenon of syntactic priming is well documented, the memory system that supports the retention of this syntactic information long enough to influence future utterances, is not as widely investigated. We aim to shed light on this issue by assessing patients with Korsakoff's amnesia on an active-passive syntactic priming task and compare their performance to controls matched in age, education, and premorbid intelligence. Patients with Korsakoff's syndrome display deficits in all subdomains of declarative memory, yet their nondeclarative memory remains intact, making them an ideal patient group to determine which memory system supports syntactic priming. In line with the hypothesis that syntactic priming relies on nondeclarative memory, the patient group shows strong priming tendencies (12.6% passive structure repetition). Our healthy control group did not show a priming tendency, presumably due to cognitive interference between declarative and nondeclarative memory. We discuss the results in relation to amnesia, aging, and compensatory mechanisms.", "Chief Residents must lead, manage and mentor a diverse and often large group of residents, however there is a lack of formal leadership training throughout graduate medical education.\nDevelopment of a 3-part Chief Resident (CR) Program focused on leading, managing and mentoring.\nEach participant completes an Emotional Intelligence (EI) Inventory prior to the day-long event. Participants receive their EI scores at the beginning of the program, which features interactive sessions on leadership, management, and feedback skills. The program then reinforces the application of their new knowledge about EI through a four station OSTE (Observed Structured Teaching Encounter). CRs practice feedback and coaching skills in a simulated environment where they need to provide the context of formative feedback to a standardized resident.\nThe aggregated mean pre-session EI score for all participants was 76.9 (an ideal score is >85). An independent-samples t-test compared the CRs' leadership and feedback performance on their first and second OSTE performance within a single afternoon session. There was a significant difference between the first OSTE performance (M\u00a0=\u00a047.92, SD\u00a0=\u00a07.8) and the second OSTE performance (M\u00a0=\u00a051.22, SD\u00a0=\u00a06.9); t (68)\u00a0=\u00a01.99, p\u00a0=\u00a00.006. These results suggest that participating in multiple OSTEs positively reinforces the core interpersonal and communication skills discussed in the didactic and practiced in the interactive portions of the program.\nThe low mean pre-session EI score achieved by our participants supports the idea that CRs enter their new roles with a level of EI that can be enhanced. CRs had an overall positive reaction to EI and its application to the core skills addressed in the program, highlighting the fact that similar programs could be used to train early career physicians to be more skilled and comfortable with leading, managing and mentoring.\nCR: Chief resident; EI: Emotional intelligence; GME: Graduate medical education; OSTE: Objective structured teaching encounter.", "The neurobiological correlates of human fluid intelligence (Gf) remain elusive. Here, we demonstrate that spatiotemporal dynamics of EEG activity correlate with baseline measures of Gf and with its modulation by cognitive training. EEG dynamics were assessed in 74 healthy participants by examination of fast-changing, recurring, topographically-defined electric patterns termed \"microstates\", which characterize the electrophysiological activity of distributed cortical networks. We find that the frequency of appearance of specific brain topographies, spatially associated with visual (microstate B) and executive control (microstate C) networks, respectively, is inversely related to Gf scores. Moreover, changes in Gf scores with cognitive training are inversely correlated with changes in microstate properties, indicating that the changes in brain network dynamics are behaviorally relevant. Finally, we find that cognitive training that increases Gf scores results in a posterior shift in the topography of microstate C. These results highlight the role of fast-changing brain electrical states in individual variability in Gf and in the response to cognitive training.", "Aging is a process during which important changes occur in different areas of development and emotional intelligence plays an essential role. The objective of this study was twofold: first, to validate the TMMS-24 in an older population; and second, to examine the mediating role of life satisfaction in the relationship between emotional intelligence and psychological well-being.\nThe sample consisted of 215 older adults (60.15% women) with a mean age of 69.56 (SD = 6.42), without cognitive impairment. Data on emotional intelligence, satisfaction with life, and psychological well-being were obtained through the TMMS-24, the SWLS, and Ryff's psychological well-being scales, respectively. Confirmatory factor analyses and structural equation modeling were conducted.\nConfirmatory factor analyses confirmed the three-dimensional structure of the TMMS-24. The total scale showed an internal consistency of 0.90, ranging from 0.84 to 0.85 for the subscales. Structural equation modeling indicated that emotional intelligence exerted an influence on psychological well-being both directly and indirectly through life satisfaction.\nThese findings show that the TMMS-24 has adequate psychometric properties for assessing emotional intelligence in elderly participants, and they indicate that emotional intelligence influences cognitive and affective judgments of life satisfaction, with these judgments of life satisfaction predicting psychological well-being.", "Blood transfusions in spine surgery are shown to be associated with increased patient morbidity. The association between transfusion performed using a liberal hemoglobin (Hb) trigger-defined as an intraoperative Hb level of \u226510\u2009g/dL, a postoperative level of \u22658\u2009g/dL, or a whole hospital nadir between 8 and 10\u2009g/dL-and perioperative morbidity and cost in spine surgery patients is unknown and thus was investigated in this study.\nThis study aimed to describe the perioperative outcomes and economic cost associated with liberal Hb trigger transfusion among spine surgery patients.\nThis is a retrospective study.\nThe surgical billing database at our institution was queried for inpatients discharged between 2008 and 2015 after the following procedures: atlantoaxial fusion, anterior cervical fusion, posterior cervical fusion, anterior lumbar fusion, posterior lumbar fusion, lateral lumbar fusion, other procedures, and tumor-related surgeries. In total, 6,931 patients were included for analysis.\nThe primary outcome was composite morbidity, which was composed of (1) infection (sepsis, surgical-site infection, Clostridium difficile infection, or drug-resistant infection); (2) thrombotic event (pulmonary embolus, deep venous thrombosis, or disseminated intravascular coagulation); (3) kidney injury; (4) respiratory event; and (5) ischemic event (transient ischemic attack, myocardial infarction, or cerebrovascular accident).\nData on intraoperative transfusion were obtained from an automated, prospectively collected anesthesia data management system. Data on postoperative hospital transfusion were obtained through a Web-based intelligence portal. Based on previous research, we analyzed the data using three definitions of a liberal transfusion trigger in patients who underwent red blood cell transfusion: a liberal intraoperative Hb trigger as a nadir Hb level of 10\u2009g/dL or greater, a liberal postoperative Hb trigger as a nadir Hb level of 8\u2009g/dL or greater, or a whole hospital nadir Hb level of 8-10\u2009g/dL. Variables analyzed included in-hospital morbidity, mortality, length of stay, and total costs associated with a liberal transfusion strategy.\nAmong patients with a whole hospital stay nadir Hb between 8 and 10\u2009g/dL, transfused patients demonstrated a longer in-hospital stay (median [interquartile range], 6 [5-9] vs. 4 [3-6] days; p<.0001) and a higher perioperative morbidity (n=145 [11.5%] vs. n=74 [6.1%], p<.0001) than those not transfused. Even after adjusting for age, gender, race, American Society of Anesthesiologists class, Charlson Comorbidity Index score, estimated blood loss, baseline Hb value, and surgery type, logistic regression analysis revealed that patients with a nadir Hb of 8-10\u2009g/dL who were transfused had an independently higher risk of perioperative morbidity (odds ratio=2.11, 95% confidence interval, 1.44-3.09; p<.0001). Estimated additional costs associated with liberal trigger use, defined as a transfusion occurring in patients with a whole hospital stay nadir Hb of 8-10\u2009g/dL, ranged from $202,675 to $700,151 annually.\nTransfusion using a liberal trigger is associated with increased morbidity, even after controlling for possible confounders. Our results suggest that modification of transfusion practice may be a potential area for improving patient outcomes and reducing costs.", "This study examines the long-term cognitive and academic outcomes of 11 individuals with infantile onset Pompe disease (IOPD) (median age=11years, 1month, range=5years, 6months through 17years of age) treated with enzyme replacement therapy from an early age. All participants (7 males, 4 females) were administered individual intelligence tests (Wechsler or Leiter scales or both), a measure of their academic skill levels (Woodcock-Johnson Tests of Achievement), and a screening measure of visual-motor integration ability (Beery-Buktenica). Consistent with our earlier findings, median IQ scores for the entire group on the Wechsler (median=84) and Leiter (median=92) scales continue to fall at the lower end of the average range compared to same-aged peers. The median scores for the group on a measure of visual-motor integration (median=76), visual perception (median=74) and motor coordination (median=60) were below average. Two distinct subgroups emerged based on participants' average or below average performance on the majority of academic subtests. Those participants with below average academic skills (n=6) demonstrated average nonverbal cognitive abilities on the Leiter, but had weaknesses in speech and language skills and greater medical involvement. Their profiles were more consistent with a learning disability diagnosis than an intellectual disability. Two of these participants showed a significant decline (15 and 23 points, respectively) on repeated Wechsler scales, but one continued to earn average scores on the Leiter scales where the verbal and motor demands are minimal. Participants with average academic skills (n=5) demonstrated average cognitive abilities (verbal and nonverbal) on the Wechsler scales and less medical involvement. Their speech and language skills appeared to be more intact. However, both groups earned below average median scores on the Beery-Buktenica motor coordination task. This study highlights the importance of using appropriate tests to capture both verbal and nonverbal abilities, considering each individual's motor skills, speech and language abilities, hearing status and native language. This will allow for a more accurate assessment of whether there is a learning disability or an intellectual disability. Long-term outcomes may be related to the stability of an individual's expressive and/or receptive language abilities over time. Changes in the speech and language domain may account for the decline in IQ observed in some IOPD long-term survivors, reflecting a learning disability rather than a decline in overall cognition or an intellectual disability. These observations, in conjunction with neuroimaging, will further our understanding of the neurocognitive profile of long-term IOPD survivors.", "Working memory (WM) includes short-term storage and executive processing of information. WM has been suggested to be one of the key concepts to explain individual differences in fluid intelligence (Gf). However, only a few studies have investigated the association of the two different aspects of WM in relation to Gf. Furthermore, even fewer studies have included children. Therefore, we first investigated the inter-relations between the WM aspects (verbal and visual-spatial storage, verbal and visual-spatial executive processing). Second, we explored the relation between a general WM factor and Gf. Third, we analyzed the relations between the different WM aspects and Gf while we controlled for common variance among all WM tasks. Nine- to 11-year olds had to solve simple and complex span tasks. Correlations and structural equation modeling techniques were used to examine these relations. Most inter-relations among simple and complex spans were found to be substantial and positive. The general WM factor was related to Gf. Furthermore, after controlling for common variance among all WM tasks, individual differences in verbal storage, visual-spatial storage and verbal processing still uniquely related to Gf. Visual-spatial processing, however, was not related to Gf. Results are discussed in terms of underlying mechanisms.", "The concept of intelligence encompasses the mental abilities necessary to survival and advancement in any environmental context. Attempts to grasp this multifaceted concept through a relatively simple operationalization have fostered the notion that individual differences in intelligence can often be expressed by a single score. This predominant position has contributed to expect intelligence profiles to remain substantially stable over the course of ontogenetic development and, more generally, across the life-span. These tendencies, however, are biased by the still limited number of empirical reports taking a developmental perspective on intelligence. Viewing intelligence as a dynamic concept, indeed, implies the need to identify full developmental trajectories, to assess how genes, brain, cognition, and environment interact with each other. In the present paper, we describe how a neuroconstructivist approach better explains why intelligence can rise or fall over development, as a result of a fluctuating interaction between the developing system itself and the environmental factors involved at different times across ontogenesis.", "Long-term recognition memory for some pictures is consistently better than for others (Isola, Xiao, Parikh, Torralba, & Oliva, IEEE Transaction on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (PAMI), 36(7), 1469-1482, 2014). Here, we investigated whether pictures found to be memorable in a long-term memory test are also perceived more easily when presented in ultra-rapid RSVP. Participants viewed 6 pictures they had never seen before that were presented for 13 to 360\u00a0ms per picture in a rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) sequence. In half the trials, one of the pictures was a memorable or a nonmemorable picture and perception of this picture was probed by a visual recognition test at the end of the sequence. Recognition for pictures from the memorable set was higher than for those from the nonmemorable set, and this difference increased with increasing duration. Nonmemorable picture recognition was low initially, did not increase until 120\u00a0ms, and never caught up with memorable picture recognition performance. Thus, the long-term memorability of an image is associated with initial perceptibility: A picture that is hard to grasp quickly is hard to remember later.", "Focusing on a group of Kazakh divorcees, this study examined the inter-relationship between posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) from past trauma, coping strategies, emotional intelligence, adjustment difficulties, and psychiatric symptom severity following divorce.\nOne hundred and twenty divorcees participated in the research and completed the Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire, Posttraumatic Stress Diagnostic Scale, General Health Questionnaire-28, Brief COPE, and Fisher's Divorce Adjustment Scale Results: About 29% reported no trauma; 53%, 21%, and 26% met the criteria for no-PTSD, partial-PTSD, and full-PTSD respectively. Emotion-focused coping and managing emotions predicted adjustment difficulties. Controlling for gender, PTSD, problem-focused coping, and managing emotions predicted psychiatric symptom severity. Problem-focused coping mediated the direct effect of the path between PTSD and psychiatric symptom severity with its mediational effect being moderated by the effect of managing emotions.\nFollowing divorce, people can experience psychological distress which is influenced by the effects of PTSD from past trauma, and whether they used problem-focused coping and were able to manage their emotions.", "This paper outlines a systematic literature review undertaken to establish current evidence regarding the impact of Business Intelligence (BI) on health system decision making and organizational performance. The review also examined BI implementation factors contributing to these constructs. Following the systematic review, inductive content analysis was used to categorize themes within the eight articles identified. This study demonstrated there is little evidence based literature focused on BI impact on organizational decision making and performance within health care. There was evidence found that BI does improve decision making. Implementation success was found to be dependent on several factors, many of which relate to broader organizational culture and readiness.", "To examine characteristics associated with physical activity capacity and performance in children with acquired brain injury (ABI).\n58 children (32 men; age 11 years 11 months \u00b1 2 years 6 months; Gross motor function classification system [GMFCS] equivalent I = 29, II = 29) >12 months post ABI were recruited. Physical activity capacity measures included: (i) combined score of three 30-second repetition maximum functional strength exercises; (ii) timed up and go; (iii) 6-minute walk test and (iv) high-level mobility assessment tool (HiMAT). Physical activity performance determined time spent in sedentary, light and moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA). Full scale intelligence quotient (FSIQ) was assessed using the Wechsler intelligence scale for Children-IV. Regression models were constructed with functional strength score (n = 56), activity counts/minutes and time spent in MVPA and sedentary (n = 37).\nThe HiMAT and FSIQ explained 69% of the variance in functional strength. Age explained 12% of the variance in counts/min and 14% of the variance in time spent sedentary. GMFCS explained 10% of the variance in time spent in MVPA.\nThe ability to perform functional strength exercises is associated with mobility beyond independence and adequate intellectual ability for children with ABI. Age was the most significant factor associated with physical activity performance, and interventions should target adolescents with ABI.", "Higher intelligence quotient (IQ) correlates with lower systemic inflammation, consistent with an association between lower IQ and disease risk. The present study examined the role of repetitive thought (RT) in the relationship between IQ and interleukin (IL)-6. RT is thinking attentively, repeatedly, and frequently about oneself and one's world and is characterized by valence (positive-negative), purpose (searching-solving), and total quantity (much-little).\nEstimated IQ and RT dimension scores were assessed at baseline in a sample of older adults (N = 120, mean age = 74 years), who thereafter had blood drawn up to 10 times semiannually (n = 799). Models were adjusted for body mass index, chronological age, and statin medication.\nHigher IQ was associated with lower IL-6 (\u03b3 = -0.225, SE = 0.111, p = .045). Of the RT dimensions, only more total RT predicted lower IL-6 (\u03b3 = -0.037, SE = 0.011, p = .001), an effect that was not moderated by valence or purpose. More total RT accounted for part of the effect of IQ on IL-6 (indirect effect = -0.06 [confidence interval = -0.14 to -0.002]). There was also a significant interaction between IQ and total RT (F(1,119) = 6.97, p = .009), in which more total RT was more strongly associated with lower IL-6 for people with lower IQ.\nAlthough some forms of RT such as worry may have negative health correlates for older adults, engaging in RT per se can be healthy insofar as it also encompasses planning, processing, and coping. Older adults with higher IQ were more likely to engage in RT, but those with average IQ benefitted the most with regard to a marker of systemic inflammation.", "Gestational diabetes (GDM) burden has been increasing progressively over the past years. Knowing that intrauterine exposure to maternal diabetes confers high risk for macrosomia as well as for future type 2 diabetes and obesity of the offspring, health care organizations try to provide effective control in spite of the limited resources. Artificial-intelligence-augmented telemedicine has been proposed as a helpful tool to facilitate an efficient widespread medical assistance to GDM. The aim of the study we present was to test the feasibility and acceptance of a mobile decision-support system for GDM, developed in the seventh framework program MobiGuide Project, which includes computer-interpretable clinical practice guidelines, access to data from the electronic health record as well as from glucose, blood pressure, and activity sensors. The results of this pilot study with 20 patients showed that the system is feasible. Compliance of patients with blood glucose monitoring was higher than that observed in a historical group of 247 patients, similar in clinical characteristics, who had been followed up for the 3 years prior to the pilot study. A questionnaire on the use of the telemedicine system showed a high degree of acceptance.", "The long-term clinical effects of wartime traumatic brain injuries (TBIs), most of which are mild, remain incompletely described. Current medical disability cost estimates from world conflicts continually surpass projections. Additional information regarding long-term functional trajectory is needed to reduce this extensive public health burden.\nTo examine 5-year clinical outcomes leveraging existing clinical data collected at 1 year after injury in the same patients and to identify early risk factors for long-term disability.\nThis prospective, longitudinal study enrolled active-duty US military after concussive blast injury (n\u2009=\u200950) in the acute to subacute stage and combat-deployed control individuals (n\u2009=\u200944) in Afghanistan or after medical evacuation to Germany from November 1, 2008, through July 1, 2013. One- and 5-year clinical evaluations were completed in the United States. All concussive blast injuries met the Department of Defense definition of mild, uncomplicated TBI. In-person clinical evaluations included standardized evaluations for neurobehavior, neuropsychological performance, and mental health burden that were essentially identical to the evaluations completed at 1-year follow-up. Data were analyzed from October 1 through November 30, 2016.\nChanges in the in-person standardized evaluations for neurobehavior, neuropsychological performance, and mental health burden from the 1- to 5-year follow-up. Predictive modeling was used to identify early risk factors for long-term disability.\nAmong the 94 participants (87 men [93%] and 7 women [7%]; mean [SD] age, 34 [8] years), global disability, satisfaction with life, neurobehavioral symptom severity, psychiatric symptom severity, and sleep impairment were significantly worse in patients with concussive blast TBI compared with combat-deployed controls, whereas performance on cognitive measures was no different between groups at the 5-year evaluation. Logistic regression on the dichotomized Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS-E) at 5 years as a measure of overall disability identified brain injury diagnosis, preinjury intelligence, motor strength, verbal fluency, and neurobehavioral symptom severity at 1 year as risk factors for a poor outcome at 5 years, with an area under the curve of 0.92 indicating excellent prediction strength. Thirty-six of 50 patients with concussive blast TBI (72%) had a decline in the GOS-E from the 1- to 5-year evaluations, in contrast with only 5 of 44 combat-deployed controls (11%). Worsening of symptoms in concussive blast TBI was also observed on measures of posttraumatic stress disorder and depression. Service members with concussive blast TBI experienced evolution, not resolution, of symptoms from the 1- to 5-year outcomes.\nConsiderable decline was observed in military service members with concussive blast TBI when comparing 1- and 5-year clinical outcomes. These results advocate for new treatment strategies to combat the long-term and extremely costly effect of these wartime injuries.", "In cases of deliberate self-poisoning (DSP), patients often ingest benzodiazepines (BZDs), known to alter memory. Experts recommend recovery of the patient's cognitive capacity before psychiatric assessment. Unfortunately, there is no validated tool in common practice to assess whether sufficient cognitive recovery has occurred after DSP with BZDs to ensure patient memory of the assessment.\nThe aim of the study was to identify cognitive functions and markers which predict preserved memory of the mental health care plan proposed at the emergency department after DSP.\nWe recruited patients admitted for DSP with BZDs and control patients. At the time of the psychiatric assessment, we performed cognitive tests and we studied the relationship between these tests and the scores of a memory test performed 24 h after.\nIn comparison with the control group, we found memory impairment in the BZD group. We found significant impairment on the Trail Making Test A (TMT A) in the BZD group in comparison with the control group, while TMT A and Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) Coding test scores were significantly correlated with memory scores.\nAttentional functions tested by WAIS Coding test and TMT A were correlated with memory score. It could be profitable to assess it in clinical practice prior to a psychiatric interview.", "Executive function (EF) performance is associated with measurements of white matter microstructure (WMS) in typical individuals. Impaired EF is a hallmark symptom of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) but it is unclear how impaired EF relates to variability in WMS. Twenty-one male youth (8-18\u00a0years) with ASD and without intellectual disability and twenty-one typical male participants (TP) matched for age, intelligence quotient, handedness, race and parental socioeconomic status were recruited. Five EF domains were assessed and several DTI-based measurements of WMS [fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD) and radial diffusivity (RD)] were estimated for eighteen white matter tracts. The ASD group had lower scores for attention (F\u00a0=\u00a08.37, p\u00a0=\u00a00.006) and response inhibition (F\u00a0=\u00a013.09, p\u00a0=\u00a00.001). Age-dependent changes of EF performance and WMS measurements were present in TP but attenuated in the ASD group. The strongest diagnosis-by-age effect was found for forceps minor, left anterior thalamic radiation and left cingulum angular bundle (all p's\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.002). In these tracts subjects with ASD tended to have equal or increased FA and/or reduced MD and/or RD at younger ages while controls had increased FA and/or reduced MD and/or RD thereafter. Only for TP individuals, increased FA in the left anterior thalamic radiation was associated with better response inhibition, while reduced RD in forceps minor and left cingulum angular bundle was related to better problem solving and working memory performance respectively. These findings provide novel insight into the age-dependency of EF performance and WMS in ASD, which can be instructive to cognitive training programs.", "The main goal of this study was to investigate the presence of cognitive impairment in patients infected with HTLV-1 presenting or not TSP/HAM.\nCross-sectional study including 104 participants: 37 asymptomatic HTLV-1 carriers, 37 patients diagnosed with TSP/HAM and 30 HTLV-1 negative control patients. Within the HTLV-1 positive group, 53 were female and 21 were male, the average age was 46 (SD=13.5) and the average schooling time was 7.7years (SD=3.3).The sociodemographic variables (genre, age and education) were compared between the three groups. The assessment tools used were: Beck Depression Inventory, Lawton's Activities of Daily Life Scale and a complete neuropsychological battery. The application of these assessment tools was carried out in blind. Both HTLV-1 asymptomatic subjects and HAM/TSP patients showed a lower performance on neuropsychological tests and higher depression scores when compared to the control group. HTLV-1 patients performed poorly in several cognitive domains, but only fluid intelligence, estimated intellectual functioning, immediate and delayed recall of visual memory and information processing speed (in the specific case of patients with TSP/HAM) reached statistical significance when compared with controls. Depression was not associated with cognitive impairment. HTLV-1 carriers presented a higher frequency of cognitive impairment than normal controls.", "Complex neonatal surgery is considered a risk factor for neuro-developmental impairment in single-ventricle patients. Neuro-developmental outcome was compared between preschool-aged Fontan patients who underwent a Norwood procedure and single-ventricle patients not requiring neonatal surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass.\nVerbal, performance and full-scale intelligence quotient (IQ) were evaluated with the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence. Cognitive functions were assessed with the German 'Kognitiver Entwicklungstest f\u00fcr das Kindergartenalter' (KET-KID). Risk factors for impaired neuro-development were evaluated.\nNeuro-developmental assessment was completed in 95 patients (Norwood: n\u2009=\u200969; non-Norwood: n\u2009=\u200926). Median (interquartile range) IQ and KET-KID scores were in the normal range. Except for verbal KET-KID, scores did not differ between Norwood and non-Norwood patients (verbal IQ: 98 (86-105) vs 93 (85-102), P\u2009=\u20090.312; performance IQ: 91 (86-100) vs 96 (86-100), P\u2009=\u20090.932; full-scale IQ: 93 (86-101) vs 89 (84-98), P\u2009=\u20090.314; KET-KID verbal: 48 (17-72) vs 25 (2-54), P\u2009=\u20090.020; KET-KID non-verbal: 33 (18-62) vs 45 (15-54), P\u2009=\u20090.771; KET-KID global: 42 (14-65) vs 28 (6-63), P\u2009=\u20090.208). Full-scale IQ was below average (<85 points) in 14 (20%) Norwood and 9 (35%) non-Norwood cases (P\u2009=\u20090.181). Global KET-KID was below average (<16th percentile) in 19 (28%) and 10 (38%) patients (P\u2009=\u20090.326). Smaller head circumference z-score and complications before neonatal surgery were independently associated with lower scores.\nNeuro-developmental outcome of preschool-aged Fontan patients was in the normal range. The Norwood procedure was not a risk factor for neuro-developmental impairment. Preoperative condition and patient-related factors were more important determinants than variables related to surgical palliation.", "One third of the world's population lacks regular access to essential medicines partly because of the high cost of medicines. In Vietnam, the cost to patients of medicines was 47 times the international reference price for originator brands and 11 times the price for generic equivalents in the public sector. In this article, we report the results of a qualitative study conducted to identify the principal reasons for inflated medicine prices in Vietnam.Between April 2008 and December 2009, 29 semi-structured interviews were conducted with staff from pharmaceutical companies, private pharmacies, the Ministry of Health, and the Ministry of Finance of Vietnam. Study participants were recruited using a combination of purposive and snowball sampling techniques. Interviews were recorded, transcribed and coded using NVivo8\u00ae software and analyzed using a framework of structure-conduct-performance (SCP).Participants attributed high prices of originator medicines to a monopoly of supply. The prices of generic medicines were also considered to be excessive, reportedly due to the need to recoup the cost of financial inducements paid to prescribers and procurement officers. These inducements constituted a dominant cost component of the end price of generic medicines. Poor market intelligence about current world prices, as well as failure to achieve economies of scale because of unwarranted duplication in pharmaceutical production and distribution system were also factors contributing to high prices. This was reported to be further compounded by multiple layers in the supply chain and unregulated retail mark-ups.To address these problems a multifaceted approach is needed encompassing policy and legislative responses. Policy options include establishing effective monitoring of medicine quality assurance, procurement, distribution and use. Rationalization of the domestic pharmaceutical production and distribution system to achieve economies of scale is also required. Appropriate legal responses include collaborations with the justice and law enforcement sectors to enforce existing laws.", "Studies have suggested that reading speed (RS) or fluency should be a component of reading comprehension (RC) models. There is also evidence of a relationship between RS and RC. However, some questions remain to be explored, as the changes in such a relationship may be a function of development. In addition, while there are studies published with English speakers and learners, less evidence exists in more transparent orthographies, such as Portuguese. This study investigated the relationship between RC and RS in typical readers. Objectives included elucidating the following: (1) the contribution of RS to RC controlling for intelligence, word recognition, and listening and (2) the differential relationships and contributions of RS to comprehension in different school grades. The sample of participants comprised 212 students (M = 8.76; SD = 1.06) from 2nd to 4th grade. We assessed intelligence, word recognition, word RS, listening, and RC. Performance in all tests increased as a function of grade. There were significant connections between RC and all other measures. Nonetheless, the regression analysis revealed that word RS has a unique contribution to RC after controlling for intelligence, word recognition, and listening, with a very modest but significant improvement in the explanatory power of the model. We found a significant relationship between RS and RC only for 4th grade and such relationship becomes marginal after controlling for word recognition. The findings suggest that RS could contribute to RC in Portuguese beyond the variance shared with listening and, mainly, word recognition, but such a contribution was very small. The data also reveal a differential relationship between RS and RC in different school grades; specifically, only for the 4th grade does RS begins to relate to RC. The findings add a developmental perspective to the study of reading models.", "Cognition is important in many sports, for example, making split-second-decisions under pressure, or memorising complex movement sequences. The dual-task (DT) paradigm is an ecologically valid approach for the assessment of cognitive function in conjunction with motor demands. This study aimed to determine the impact of impaired intelligence on DT performance. The motor task required balancing on one leg on a beam, and the cognitive task was a multiple-object-tracking (MOT) task assessing dynamic visual-search capacity. The sample included 206 well-trained athletes with and without intellectual impairment (II), matched for sport, age and training volume (140 males, 66 females, M age\u00a0=\u00a023.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.1\u00a0years, M training experience\u00a0=\u00a012.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.7\u00a0years). In the single-task condition, II-athletes showed reduced balance control (F\u00a0=\u00a055.9, P\u00a0<\u00a0.001, \u03b72\u00a0=\u00a0.23) and reduced MOT (F\u00a0=\u00a086.3, P\u00a0<\u00a0.001, \u03b72\u00a0=\u00a0.32) compared to the control group. A mixed-model ANCOVA revealed significant differences in DT performance for the balance and the MOT task between both groups. The DT costs were significantly larger for the II-athletes (-8.28% versus -1.34% for MOT and -33.13% versus -12.89% for balance). The assessment of MOT in a DT paradigm provided insight in how impaired intelligence constrains the ability of II-athletes to successfully perform at the highest levels in the complex and dynamical sport-environment.", "Jaundice is a common and complex clinical symptom potentially occurring in hepatology, general surgery, pediatrics, infectious diseases, gynecology, and obstetrics, and it is fairly difficult to distinguish the cause of jaundice in clinical practice, especially for general practitioners in less developed regions. With collaboration between physicians and artificial intelligence engineers, a comprehensive knowledge base relevant to jaundice was created based on demographic information, symptoms, physical signs, laboratory tests, imaging diagnosis, medical histories, and risk factors. Then a diagnostic modeling and reasoning system using the dynamic uncertain causality graph was proposed. A modularized modeling scheme was presented to reduce the complexity of model construction, providing multiple perspectives and arbitrary granularity for disease causality representations. A \"chaining\" inference algorithm and weighted logic operation mechanism were employed to guarantee the exactness and efficiency of diagnostic reasoning under situations of incomplete and uncertain information. Moreover, the causal interactions among diseases and symptoms intuitively demonstrated the reasoning process in a graphical manner. Verification was performed using 203 randomly pooled clinical cases, and the accuracy was 99.01% and 84.73%, respectively, with or without laboratory tests in the model. The solutions were more explicable and convincing than common methods such as Bayesian Networks, further increasing the objectivity of clinical decision-making. The promising results indicated that our model could be potentially used in intelligent diagnosis and help decrease public health expenditure.", "Performing randomised comparative clinical trials in radiation oncology remains a challenge when new treatment modalities become available. One of the most recent examples is the lack of phase III trials demonstrating the superiority of intensity-modulated radiation therapy in most of its current indications. A new paradigm is developing that consists in the mining of large databases to answer clinical or translational issues. Beyond national databases (such as SEER or NCDB), that often lack the necessary level of details on the population studied or the treatments performed, electronic health records can be used to create detailed phenotypic profiles of any patients. In parallel, the Record-and-Verify Systems used in radiation oncology precisely document the planned and performed treatments. Artificial Intelligence and machine learning algorithms can be used to incrementally analyse these data in order to generate hypothesis to better personalize treatments. This review discusses how these methods have already been used in previous studies.", "Measures of social cognition are increasingly being applied to psychopathology, including studies of schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders. Tests of social cognition present unique challenges for international adaptations. The Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test, Managing Emotions Branch (MSCEIT-ME) is a commonly-used social cognition test that involves the evaluation of social scenarios presented in vignettes.\nThis paper presents evaluations of translations of this test in six different languages based on representative samples from the relevant countries. The goal was to identify items from the MSCEIT-ME that show different response patterns across countries using indices of discrepancy and content validity criteria. An international version of the MSCEIT-ME scoring was developed that excludes items that showed undesirable properties across countries.\nWe then confirmed that this new version had better performance (i.e. less discrepancy across regions) in international samples than the version based on the original norms. Additionally, it provides scores that are comparable to ratings based on local norms.\nThis paper shows that it is possible to adapt complex social cognitive tasks so they can provide valid data across different cultural contexts.", "Machine learning is a means to derive artificial intelligence by discovering patterns in existing data. Here, we show that applying machine learning to ordinary human language results in human-like semantic biases. We replicated a spectrum of known biases, as measured by the Implicit Association Test, using a widely used, purely statistical machine-learning model trained on a standard corpus of text from the World Wide Web. Our results indicate that text corpora contain recoverable and accurate imprints of our historic biases, whether morally neutral as toward insects or flowers, problematic as toward race or gender, or even simply veridical, reflecting the status quo distribution of gender with respect to careers or first names. Our methods hold promise for identifying and addressing sources of bias in culture, including technology.", "To demonstrate that Coefficient omega, a model-based estimate, is more a more appropriate index of reliability than coefficient alpha for the multidimensional scales that are commonly employed by neuropsychologists.\nAs an illustration, a structural model of an overarching general factor and four first-order factors for the WAIS-IV based on the standardization sample of 2200 participants was identified and omega coefficients were subsequently computed for WAIS-IV composite scores.\nAlpha coefficients were\u00a0\u2265\u00a0.90 and omega coefficients ranged from .75 to .88 for WAIS-IV factor index scores, indicating that the blend of general and group factor variance in each index score created a reliable multidimensional composite. However, the amalgam of variance from general and group factors did not allow the precision of Full Scale IQ (FSIQ) and factor index scores to be disentangled. In contrast, omega hierarchical coefficients were low for all four factor index scores (.10-.41), indicating that most of the reliable variance of each factor index score was due to the general intelligence factor. In contrast, the omega hierarchical coefficient for the FSIQ score was .84.\nMeaningful interpretation of WAIS-IV factor index scores as unambiguous indicators of group factors is imprecise, thereby fostering unreliable identification of neurocognitive strengths and weaknesses, whereas the WAIS-IV FSIQ score can be interpreted as a reliable measure of general intelligence. It was concluded that neuropsychologists should base their clinical decisions on reliable scores as indexed by coefficient omega.", "To identify challenging interpersonal interactions experienced by nursing and pharmacy students during clinical placement, and strategies used to manage those situations.\nHealthcare students and staff experience elevated stress when exposed to dynamic clinical environments, complex care and challenging professional relationships. Emotionally intelligent behaviours are associated with appropriate recognition and management of emotions evoked by stressful experiences and development of effective relationships. Nursing and pharmacy students' use of emotionally intelligent behaviours to manage challenging interpersonal situations is not well known.\nA qualitative design, using semi-structured interviews to explore experiences of challenging interpersonal situations during clinical placement (Phase two of a larger mixed-methods study). Final-year Australian university nursing and pharmacy students (n\u00a0=\u00a020) were purposefully recruited using a range of Emotional Intelligence scores (derived in Phase one), measured using the GENOS Emotional intelligence Inventory (concise version).\nChallenging interpersonal situations involving student-staff and intrastaff conflict, discourteous behaviour and criticism occurred during clinical placement. Students used personal and relational strategies, incorporating emotionally intelligent behaviours, to manage these encounters. Strategies included reflecting and reframing, being calm, controlling discomfort and expressing emotions appropriately.\nEmotionally intelligent behaviours are effective to manage stressful interpersonal interactions. Methods for strengthening these behaviours should be integrated into education of nursing and pharmacy students and qualified professionals. Education within the clinical/workplace environment can incorporate key interpersonal skills of collaboration, social interaction and reflection, while also attending to sociocultural contexts of the healthcare setting.\nStudents and staff are frequently exposed to stressful clinical environments and challenging interpersonal encounters within healthcare settings. Use of emotionally intelligent behaviours to recognise and effectively manage these encounters may contribute to greater stress tolerance and enhanced professional relationships. Nursing and pharmacy students, and their qualified counterparts, need to be educated to strengthen their emotional intelligence skills.", "Age-associated disease and disability are placing a growing burden on society. However, ageing does not affect people uniformly. Hence, markers of the underlying biological ageing process are needed to help identify people at increased risk of age-associated physical and cognitive impairments and ultimately, death. Here, we present such a biomarker, 'brain-predicted age', derived using structural neuroimaging. Brain-predicted age was calculated using machine-learning analysis, trained on neuroimaging data from a large healthy reference sample (N=2001), then tested in the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936 (N=669), to determine relationships with age-associated functional measures and mortality. Having a brain-predicted age indicative of an older-appearing brain was associated with: weaker grip strength, poorer lung function, slower walking speed, lower fluid intelligence, higher allostatic load and increased mortality risk. Furthermore, while combining brain-predicted age with grey matter and cerebrospinal fluid volumes (themselves strong predictors) not did improve mortality risk prediction, the combination of brain-predicted age and DNA-methylation-predicted age did. This indicates that neuroimaging and epigenetics measures of ageing can provide complementary data regarding health outcomes. Our study introduces a clinically-relevant neuroimaging ageing biomarker and demonstrates that combining distinct measurements of biological ageing further helps to determine risk of age-related deterioration and death.", "There is considerable genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity associated with intellectual disability (ID), specific learning disabilities, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, autism and epilepsy. The intelligence quotient (IQ) motif and SEC7 domain containing protein 2 gene (IQSEC2) is located on the X-chromosome and harbors mutations that contribute to non-syndromic ID with and without early-onset seizure phenotypes in both sexes. Although IQ and Sec7 domain mutations lead to partial loss of IQSEC2 enzymatic activity, the in vivo pathogenesis resulting from these mutations is not known. Here we reveal that IQSEC2 has a key role in dendritic spine morphology. Partial loss-of-function mutations were modeled using a lentiviral short hairpin RNA (shRNA) approach, which achieved a 57% knockdown of Iqsec2 expression in primary hippocampal cell cultures from mice. Investigating gross morphological parameters after 8 days of in vitro culture (8DIV) identified a 32% reduction in primary axon length, in contrast to a 27% and 31% increase in the number and complexity of dendrites protruding from the cell body, respectively. This increase in dendritic complexity and spread was carried through dendritic spine development, with a 34% increase in the number of protrusions per dendritic segment compared with controls at 15DIV. Although the number of dendritic spines had normalized by 21DIV, a reduction was noted in the number of immature spines. In contrast, when modeling increased dosage, overexpression of wild-type IQSEC2 led to neurons with shorter axons that were more compact and displayed simpler dendritic branching. Disturbances to dendritic morphology due to knockdown of Iqsec2 were recapitulated in neurons from Iqsec2 knockout mice generated in our laboratory using CRISPR/Cas9 technology. These observations provide evidence of dosage sensitivity for IQSEC2, which normally escapes X-inactivation in females, and links these disturbances in expression to alterations in the morphology of developing neurons.", "Cronbach's (1957) famous division of scientific psychology into two disciplines is still apparent for the fields of cognition (general mechanisms) and intelligence (dimensionality of individual differences). The welcome integration of the two fields requires the construction of mechanistic models of cognition and cognitive development that explain key phenomena in individual differences research. In this paper, we argue that network modeling is a promising approach to integrate the processes of cognitive development and (developing) intelligence into one unified theory. Network models are defined mathematically, describe mechanisms on the level of the individual, and are able to explain positive correlations among intelligence subtest scores-the empirical basis for the well-known g-factor-as well as more complex factorial structures. Links between network modeling, factor modeling, and item response theory allow for a common metric, encompassing both discrete and continuous characteristics, for cognitive development and intelligence.", "Despite evidence supporting the presence of cognitive deficits in children and adolescents with high-functioning autism spectrum disorder (HF-ASD), the nature of these deficits and their clinical and adaptive correlates remain unclear. Moreover, there are few cognitive studies of ASD siblings as a high risk population. We compared 50 children and adolescents with HF-ASD, 22 unaffected siblings of the HF-ASD sample and 34 community controls using an extensive neuropsychological battery. Planning, cognitive flexibility, verbal and working memory, visual local-global processing and emotion recognition are impaired in HF-ASD. Worse cognitive performance, especially in verbal and working memory, was significantly correlated with more severe symptoms and poorer adaptive functioning, also when controlling for intelligence quotient. Results in siblings may suggest an intermediate profile.", "To investigate the current state of knowledge about emotional intelligence and affective events that arise during nursing students' clinical placement experiences.\nNarrative literature review.\nCINAHL, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Scopus, Web of Science, ERIC and APAIS-Health databases published in English between 1990 and 2016.\nData extraction from and constant comparative analysis of ten (10) research articles.\nWe found four main themes: (1) emotional intelligence buffers stress; (2) emotional intelligence reduces anxiety associated with end of life care; (3) emotional intelligence promotes effective communication; and (4) emotional intelligence improves nursing performance.\nThe articles we analysed adopted a variety of emotional intelligence models. Using the Ashkanasy and Daus \"three-stream\" taxonomy (Stream 1: ability models; 2: self-report; 3: mixed models), we found that Stream 2 self-report measures were the most popular followed by Stream 3 mixed model measures. None of the studies we surveyed used the Stream 1 approach. Findings nonetheless indicated that emotional intelligence was important in maintaining physical and psychological well-being. We concluded that developing emotional intelligence should be a useful adjunct to improve academic and clinical performance and to reduce the risk of emotional distress during clinical placement experiences. We call for more consistency in the use of emotional intelligence tests as a means to create an empirical evidence base in the field of nurse education.", "Therapies to extend healthspan are poised to move from laboratory animal models to human clinical trials. Translation from mouse to human will entail challenges, among them the multifactorial heterogeneity of human aging. To inform clinical trials about this heterogeneity, we report how humans' pace of biological aging relates to personal-history characteristics. Because geroprotective therapies must be delivered by midlife to prevent age-related disease onset, we studied young-adult members of the Dunedin Study 1972-73 birth cohort (n\u00a0=\u00a0954). Cohort members' Pace of Aging was measured as coordinated decline in the integrity of multiple organ systems, by quantifying rate of decline across repeated measurements of 18 biomarkers assayed when cohort members were ages 26, 32, and 38\u00a0years. The childhood personal-history characteristics studied were known predictors of age-related disease and mortality, and were measured prospectively during childhood. Personal-history characteristics of familial longevity, childhood social class, adverse childhood experiences, and childhood health, intelligence, and self-control all predicted differences in cohort members' adulthood Pace of Aging. Accumulation of more personal-history risks predicted faster Pace of Aging. Because trials of anti-aging therapies will need to ascertain personal histories retrospectively, we replicated results using cohort members' retrospective personal-history reports made in adulthood. Because many trials recruit participants from clinical settings, we replicated results in the cohort subset who had recent health system contact according to electronic medical records. Quick, inexpensive measures of trial participants' early personal histories can enable clinical trials to study who volunteers for trials, who adheres to treatment, and who responds to anti-aging therapies.", "Performance review discussions of real manager-subordinate pairs were examined in two studies to investigate the effects of trait emotional intelligence (EI) on dyad member's felt and expressed emotions. Altogether there were 84 managers and 122 subordinates in two studies using 360 measured and self-reported trait EI. Facial electromyography, and frontal electroencephalography (EEG) asymmetry were collected continuously. Manager's high trait EI was related to increased positive valence emotional facial expressions in the dyad during the discussions. The managers also had more EEG frontal asymmetry indicating approach motivation, than the subordinates. In addition, actor and partner effects and actor \u00d7 partner interactions, and interactions between the role and actor or partner effect of trait EI were observed. Both actor and partner trait EI were related to more positive self-reported emotional valence. The results imply that trait EI has a role in organizational social interaction.", "Case-based reasoning and data interpretation is an artificial intelligence approach that capitalizes on past experience to solve current problems and this can be used as a method for practical intelligent systems. Case-based data reasoning is able to provide decision support for experts and clinicians in health systems as well as lifestyle systems. In this project we were focusing on developing a solution for healthy ageing considering daily activities, nutrition as well as cognitive activities. The data analysis of the reasoner followed state of the art guidelines from clinical practice. Guidelines provide a general framework to guide clinicians, and require consequent background knowledge to become operational, which is precisely the kind of information recorded in practice cases; cases complement guidelines very well and helps to interpret them. It is expected that the interest in case-based reasoning systems in the health.", "Compositionality, or the ability to build complex cognitive structures from simple parts, is fundamental to the power of the human mind. Here we relate this principle to the psychometric concept of fluid intelligence, traditionally measured with tests of complex reasoning. Following the principle of compositionality, we propose that the critical function in fluid intelligence is splitting a complex whole into simple, separately attended parts. To test this proposal, we modify traditional matrix reasoning problems to minimize requirements on information integration, working memory, and processing speed, creating problems that are trivial once effectively divided into parts. Performance remains poor in participants with low fluid intelligence, but is radically improved by problem layout that aids cognitive segmentation. In line with the principle of compositionality, we suggest that effective cognitive segmentation is important in all organized behavior, explaining the broad role of fluid intelligence in successful cognition.", "Little is known regarding the neuropsychological profiles of pediatric patients with mitochondrial diseases or their parents, information that is crucial for improving the quality of life (QOL) for both patients and parents. We aimed to delineate neurodevelopment and psychological comorbidity in children with mitochondrial diseases in the preliminary investigation of adequate intervention methods, better prognoses, and improved QOL for both patients and parents.\nSeventy children diagnosed with mitochondrial diseases were neuropsychologically evaluated. Neurocognitive (development, intelligence) and psychological (behavior, daily living function, maternal depression, parenting stress) functions were analyzed. Clinical variables, including the first symptom, epileptic classification, organ involvement, lactic acidosis, brain magnetic resonance imaging findings, muscle pathology, biochemical enzyme assay results, and syndromic diagnosis of mitochondrial diseases, were also reviewed.\nPrediagnostic assessments indicated that cognitive and psychomotor developments were significantly delayed. Group mean full scale intelligence quotient (IQ) scores indicated mild levels of intellectual disability, borderline levels of verbal IQ impairment, and mild levels of intellectual disability on performance IQ. Many children exhibited clinically significant levels of behavioral problems, whereas mothers of children with mitochondrial diseases exhibited significant increases in parenting stress relative to mothers of healthy children. Furthermore, 65% of mothers exhibited significant levels of depression. Early onset of the first symptoms, diffuse brain atrophy, and drug-resistant epilepsy negatively influenced neurodevelopmental and adaptive functions.\nBetter understanding of the functional levels and profiles of neurodevelopment and psychological comorbidity in children with mitochondrial diseases in the prediagnostic period is essential for adequate support and QOL of children with mitochondrial diseases and their parents.", "Objective To describe the process of preparation and response of local health authorities in key public health issues while facing the introduction stage of an unusual virus: Chikungunya in Colombia in 2014. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted using a survey that was developed for this study and sent to Public Health coordinators and to the person in charge of vector borne-diseases in the country's territorial entities. Results 23 out of the 35 territories at risk from the transmission of Chikungunya agreed to answer the survey. A global review of the survey scores for each evaluated section shows better performances in the areas of knowledge management, comprehensive patient care, epidemiological intelligence, and health promotion. According to the results of this study, the epidemiological surveillance system during the Chikungunya epidemic had a low acceptability and flexibility, possibly contributing to the underreporting of cases. Conclusions In general, knowledge and implementation by local authorities of the Integrated Health Strategy- EGI (Estrategia de Gesti\u00f3n Integral, by its Spanish acronym)- for vector-borne diseases was evident from the themes evaluated in this study. However, it is necessary to reinforce the communication of risks, laboratory, and outbreak and contingencies management areas faced during the introduction of new viruses.", "Massively parallel sequencing (MPS) is fast approaching operational use in forensic science, with the capability to analyse hundreds of DNA identity and DNA intelligence markers in multiple samples simultaneously. The ForenSeq\u2122 DNA Signature Kit on MiSeq FGx\u2122 (Illumina) workflow can provide profiles for autosomal short tandem repeats (STRs), X chromosome and Y chromosome STRs, identity single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), biogeographical ancestry SNPs and phenotype (eye and hair colour) SNPs from a sample. The library preparation procedure involves a series of steps including target amplification, library purification and library normalisation. This study highlights the comparison between the manufacturer recommended magnetic bead normalisation and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) methods. Furthermore, two qPCR chemistries, KAPA\u00ae (KAPA Biosystems) and NEBNext\u00ae (New England Bio Inc.), have also been compared. The qPCR outperformed the bead normalisation method, while the NEBNext\u00ae kit obtained higher genotype concordance than KAPA\u00ae. The study also established an MPS workflow that can be utilised in any operational forensic laboratory.", "The advent of microcomputers in the 1970s has dramatically changed our society. Since then, microprocessors have been made almost exclusively from silicon, but the ever-increasing demand for higher integration density and speed, lower power consumption and better integrability with everyday goods has prompted the search for alternatives. Germanium and III-V compound semiconductors are being considered promising candidates for future high-performance processor generations and chips based on thin-film plastic technology or carbon nanotubes could allow for embedding electronic intelligence into arbitrary objects for the Internet-of-Things. Here, we present a 1-bit implementation of a microprocessor using a two-dimensional semiconductor-molybdenum disulfide. The device can execute user-defined programs stored in an external memory, perform logical operations and communicate with its periphery. Our 1-bit design is readily scalable to multi-bit data. The device consists of 115 transistors and constitutes the most complex circuitry so far made from a two-dimensional material.", "The tendency to lie is a part of personality. But are personality traits the only factors that make some people lie more often than others? We propose that cognitive abilities have equal importance. People with higher cognitive abilities are better, and thus more effective liars. This might reinforce using lies to solve problems. Yet, there is no empirical research that shows this relationship in healthy adults. Here we present three studies in which the participants had free choice about their honesty. We related differences in cognitive abilities and personality to the odds of lying. Results show that personality and intelligence are both important. People low on agreeableness and intelligent extraverts are most likely to lie. This suggests that intelligence might mediate the relationship between personality traits and lying frequency. While personality traits set general behavioral tendencies, intelligence and environment set boundaries.", "Studies of collective intelligence in animal groups typically overlook potential improvement through learning. Although knowledge accumulation is recognized as a major advantage of group living within the framework of Cumulative Cultural Evolution (CCE), the interplay between CCE and collective intelligence has remained unexplored. Here, we use homing pigeons to investigate whether the repeated removal and replacement of individuals in experimental groups (a key method in testing for CCE) alters the groups' solution efficiency over successive generations. Homing performance improves continuously over generations, and later-generation groups eventually outperform both solo individuals and fixed-membership groups. Homing routes are more similar in consecutive generations within the same chains than between chains, indicating cross-generational knowledge transfer. Our findings thus show that collective intelligence in animal groups can accumulate progressive modifications over time. Furthermore, our results satisfy the main criteria for CCE and suggest potential mechanisms for CCE that do not rely on complex cognition.", "Gonadal dysgenesis is unique in disorders of sex development (DSD), in that it can be associated with 46,XX, 46,XY or mosaic 45,X/46,XY karyotypes. Gonadal dysgenesis can be partial or complete. Gonadal dysgenesis associated with the Y-chromosome has increased risk of gonadal germ cell neoplasms. Most of the literature focus on 45,X/46,XY gonadal dysgenesis, while there are scanty data on the condition when the karyotype is non-mosaic 46,XY.\nTo investigate the diversity of clinical pictures of children presenting with 46,XY DSD due to gonadal dysgenesis.\nA retrospective study on consecutive patients diagnosed with 46,XY gonadal dysgenesis at age \u226418 years in a tertiary center from 1985 to 2015. The clinical presentations, phenotypes, gonadal features and associated anomalies were investigated.\nTwenty-eight patients with Y-chromosome gonadal dysgenesis were identified during the study period and six (21.4%) had non-mosaic 46,XY karyotype. Three had complete gonadal dysgenesis (CGD) with normal female phenotype, while the other three had partial gonadal dysgenesis (PGD). Of the three patients with CGD, two presented with the classical Swyer syndrome at adolescence, while the third presented at birth with multiple congenital anomalies. The three PGD patients presented with ambiguous genitalia at birth (n\u00a0=\u00a02), and isolated hypospadias (n\u00a0=\u00a01), which was associated with Frasier syndrome. Three patients had germ cell neoplasms: bilateral gonadoblastoma (n\u00a0=\u00a01), bilateral intratubular germ cell neoplasia unclassified (n\u00a0=\u00a01), and dysgerminoma\u00a0+\u00a0gonadoblastoma (n\u00a0=\u00a01). Two patients had global developmental delay with other congenital anomalies, and another patient had learning difficulties with borderline intelligence (Table).\nThe findings suggest that 46,XY gonadal dysgenesis is much rarer than 45,X/46,XY gonadal dysgenesis. Patients differed in their clinical presentations and well-established syndromes happened in half of them. Overall, the risk of germ cell neoplasms and the association with other somatic anomalies appeared to be high. The study was limited by: its small number, single-center experience, and the possibility of missing the diagnosis in some male patients with mild undervirilization.\nHeterogeneity was noted in the clinical, phenotypic and gonadal features among pediatric patients with 46,XY gonadal dysgenesis.", "The present study aims to characterize emotional intelligence (EI) variability in a sample of euthymic bipolar disorder (BD) patients through the Mayer- Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test (MSCEIT).\nA total of 134 euthymic BD outpatients were recruited and divided into three groups according to the total Emotional Intelligence Quotient (EIQ) score of the MSCEIT, following a statistical criterion of scores 1.5SDs above/below the normative group mean, as follows: a low performance (LP) group (EIQ <85), a normal performance (NP) group (85\u2264EIQ\u2264115), and a high performance (HP) group (EIQ >115). Afterwards, main sociodemographic, clinical, functional and neurocognitive variables were compared between the groups.\nThree groups were identified: 1) LP group (n=16, 12%), 2) NP group (n=93, 69%) and 3) HP group (n=25, 19%). There were significant differences between the groups in premorbid intelligence quotient (IQ) (p=0.010), axis II comorbidity (p=0.008), subthreshold depressive symptoms (p=0.027), general functioning (p=0.013) and in four specific functional domains: autonomy, occupation, interpersonal relations and leisure time. Significant differences in neurocognitive performance were found between groups with the LP group showing the lowest attainments.\nThe cross-sectional design of the study.\nOur results suggest that EI variability among BD patients, assessed through MSCEIT, is lower than expected. EI could be associated with premorbid IQ, subthreshold depressive symptoms, neurocognitive performance and general functioning. The identification of different profiles of SC may help guide specific interventions for distinct patient subgroups aimed at improving social cognition, neurocognitive performance and psychosocial functioning.", "The stability and reactivity of clusters are closely related to their valence electronic configuration. Doping is a most efficient method to modify the electronic configuration and properties of a cluster. Considering that Cu and S posses one and six valence electrons, respectively, the S doped Cu clusters with even number of valence electrons are expected to be more stable than those with odd number of electrons. By using the swarm intelligence based CALYPSO method on crystal structural prediction, we have explored the structures of neutral and charged Cun+1 and CunS (n\u2009=\u20091-12) clusters. The electronic properties of the lowest energy structures have been investigated systemically by first-principles calculations with density functional theory. The results showed that the clusters with a valence count of 2, 8 and 12 appear to be magic numbers with enhanced stability. In addition, several geometry-related-properties have been discussed and compared with those results available in the literature.", "To determine the association between sucking in infants born preterm and developmental outcomes at 5 years.\nThirty-four infants were included (mean gestational age 30wks 4d, mean birthweight 1407g). The Neonatal Oral-Motor Assessment Scale was used longitudinally from 37 to 50\u00a0weeks postmenstrual age. At 5\u00a0years, we assessed motor skills, intelligence, language, verbal memory, and behavioural problems. Linear regression analyses were performed to test whether aspects of sucking behaviour predicted these developmental outcomes. Where linear regression was not appropriate, Spearman's correlation coefficients were calculated between sucking and developmental outcomes.\nSucking was associated with total motor skills (B [unstandardized correlation coefficient for normally distributed data]=22.66, 95% confidence interval [CI] 6.61 to 38.71), balance (Spearman's \u03c1=0.64, p<0.001), total intelligence (B=-1.16, 95% CI -1.89 to -0.44, B=10.48, 95% CI 0.39 to 20.71, B=-2.22, 95% CI -3.42 to -1.02), verbal intelligence (B=-0.95; 95% CI -1.83 to -0.07, B=-2.02; 95% CI -3.55 to -0.49), performance intelligence (B=-1.34, 95% CI -2.13 to -0.54, B=12.36, 95% CI 1.13 to 23.60, B=-2.37, 95% CI -3.75 to -0.96), and language (B=-1.78, 95% CI -3.36 to -0.19). All associations were in the same direction: the better the sucking, the higher the test scores. Verbal memory and behavioural problems were not associated with sucking.\nAbnormal sucking between 42 weeks and 50 weeks postmenstrual age may reflect abnormal neurological functioning in children born preterm.", "Stroke is the second most common cause of death, and a common cause of dependency and dementia. Adult vascular risk factors and socioeconomic status (SES) are associated with increased risk, but less is known about early life risk factors, such as education, childhood SES, or intelligence (IQ).\nWe comprehensively searched Medline, PsycINFO, and EMBASE from inception to November 2015. We included all studies reporting data on >50 strokes examining childhood/premorbid IQ, SES, and education. Two reviewers independently screened full texts and extracted and cross-checked data, including available risk factor adjustments. We meta-analyzed stroke risk using hazard ratios (HR), odds ratios (OR), and mean differences (MD). We tested effects of study and participant characteristics in sensitivity analyses and meta-regression, and assessed heterogeneity and publication bias.\nWe identified 90 studies examining stroke risk and education (79), SES (10), or IQ (nine) including approximately 164,683 stroke and over 5 million stroke-free participants. Stroke risk increased with lower education (OR = 1.35, 95% CI = 1.24, 1.48), SES (OR = 1.28, 95% CI = 1.12, 1.46), and IQ (HR = 1.17, 95% CI = 1.00, 1.37) in studies reporting point estimates, with similar associations for MD. We found minimal publication bias. Between-study heterogeneity was partly explained by participant age and case ascertainment method.\nEducation, childhood SES, and intelligence have modest but important associations with lifetime stroke, and hence dementia, risks. Future studies distinguishing between the individual and combined effects of education, childhood SES and intelligence are needed to determine the independent contribution of each factor to stroke risk.

However, whether and how anatomical distance affects the cortical-subcortical connectivity in SD remain unclear. This study aims to examine whether anatomical distance affects the cortical-subcortical in first-episode, drug-naive SD.\nTwenty-five first-episode, drug-naive patients with SD and twenty-eight healthy controls were recruited for a resting-state scan. Regional functional connectivity strength (FCS) was calculated for each voxel in the brain, which was further divided into short- and long-range FCSs. Correlation analyses were conducted between abnormal FCS and clinical/cognitive variables in the patients.\nCompared with the controls, the patients showed increased short-range positive FCS (spFCS) in the right superior frontal gyrus (SFG) and decreased spFCS in the left pallidum, and increased long-range positive FCS (lpFCS) in the left middle frontal gyrus and right inferior temporal gyrus (ITG). Positive correlations were observed between the spFCS values in the right SFG and Eysenck Personality Questionnaire psychoticism scores (r=0.441, p=0.027, uncorrected) and between the lpFCS values in the right ITG and scores of digit symbol-coding of Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (r=0.416, p=0.039, uncorrected) in the patients CONCLUSIONS: The patients exhibited increased spFCS/lpFCS in the cortical regions and decreased spFCS in the subcortical regions. The left pallidum is first reported here to show decreased spFCS in SD. The present results suggest that abnormal cortical-subcortical circuits may play an important role in SD neurobiology.", "Compared with children born near term, those born extremely preterm (EP) are at much higher risk for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Little information is available about differences in neuropsychological outcomes among EP children with and without ADHD. Our analyses aimed to evaluate the neuropsychological correlates of ADHD symptoms in extremely low gestational age newborns (ELGANs).\nWe obtained Child Symptom Inventory-4 reports from parents (n = 871) and teachers (n = 634) of 10-year-old children born before the 28th week of gestation. Participants completed standardized assessments of neurocognitive and academic functioning.\nIn the total sample, children who screened positive for ADHD symptoms were at increased risk for neurocognitive limitations. These associations were weaker when the sample was limited to those with intelligence quotient (IQ) \u226570 or \u226585. Even those with IQ \u226585 who screened positive for ADHD symptoms were more likely than their peers to have deficits on the DAS-II Working Memory Cluster and the NEPSY-II Auditory Response subtest. The risks for impaired academic performance (Z \u2264 -1) on components of the WIAT-III were 2-to-3 times higher in this group than among ELGANs not classified as having ADHD symptoms.\nAmong children born EP, those with ADHD symptoms are more likely to have global neurocognitive impairment. When IQ is within normal limits, ADHD symptoms are associated with deficits in executive functioning skills. These findings highlight a group at risk for executive functioning deficits and related academic difficulties, even in the absence of intellectual disability.", "This paper examined the political and social implications of the Compendium de epidemia prescription written by the Masters of the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Paris in the mid-14th century during the Black Death. This study aimed to examine how the effects of power as a discourse owned by medical knowledge are revealed.\nThis paper outlines the composition of the contents based on the 1888 edition edited and translated by \u00c9mile H. R\u00e9bouis and notes the features of the prescription examined by the existing study of medical history rather than the causes of diseases.\nCompendium de epidemia seems to have been written primarily for the royal family and nobles who ordered them when looking at prescription-related technologies. At the same time, under the influence of Islamic-Arabic academia, it clearly distinguishes the world of faith and the world of academia (intelligence), explaining the pathogenesis and infection pathways based on causality. The onset substrate is due to heat and humidity, and the prescription is to prevent the two from overdoing in the body. In particular, issues related to heat are criticized in connection with the value of life of knight-noblesse. This is in response to political criticism of the ineffectual French royal family and nobility at the beginning of the Hundred Years' War and shows why this tract sets the utilitas publica at the forefront as an important purpose.\nThe conclusion has shown how medical knowledge produced on the Black Death pandemic how they function as discourses that have a sort of power effect on the value of life of knight-noblesse. It is necessary to conduct if these phenomena can be found in other contemporary medical writings.", "Disordered eating behaviors are on the rise among youth. The present study investigates psychosocial and weight-related variables as predictors of eating disorders (ED) through disordered eating (DE) dimensions (namely restrained, external, and emotional eating) in Lebanese university students.\nThe sample consisted of 244 undergraduates (143 female) aged from 18 to 31\u00a0years (M\u00a0=\u00a020.06; SD\u00a0=\u00a01.67). Using path analysis, two statistical models were built separately with restrained and emotional eating as dependent variables, and all possible direct and indirect pathways were tested for mediating effects. The variables tested for were media influence, perfectionism, trait emotional intelligence, and the Big Five dimensions.\nIn the first model, media pressure, self-control, and extraversion predicted eating disorders via emotional eating. In the second model, media pressure and perfectionism predicted eating disorders via restrained eating.\nFindings from this study provide an understanding of the dynamics between DE, ED, and key personality, emotion-related, and social factors in youth. Lastly, implications and recommendations for future studies are advanced.", "Neurodevelopmental difficulties in children following hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE) may not emerge until school age.\nTo evaluate the value and stability of early serial developmental assessments in predicting long-term outcome.\nProspective study of infants with neonatal HIE and early continuous EEG at birth.\nTerm infants with HIE were recruited at birth. Development was measured at 6, 12 and 24months using the Revised Griffiths' Scales (GMDS-R).\nIntellectual abilities at age five were measured using the Wechsler Preschool & Primary Scale of Intelligence (WPPSI-IIIUK) and the 'numbers' subtest from the Children's Memory Scale. Overall five-year outcome was also reported.\nIQ outcome was available in forty-seven surviving children (28 male, 19 female: mean (SD) age 64.0(5.7) months. Mean processing speed (p=0.01) and short-term verbal memory (p=0.005) were below the norm. Global development (GDQ) at 6, 12 and 24months correlated (p<0.01) with five-year global, verbal and performance IQ with improved correlation over time. Normal GDQ throughout early childhood predicted normal IQ at 5years (24month AUROC value=0.941, p=0.001). An abnormal early GDQ score at any stage in the first 24months had excellent negative predictive values, superior to those for neonatal Sarnat and EEG grading.\nNormal early development predicts normal 5year IQ with prediction increasing over time. Repeated measurement is warranted due to instability of findings across the first two years. Follow-up for children with abnormal early development is warranted given high sensitivity for school-age global abnormal outcome.", "Individuals' implicit theories of intelligence exist on a spectrum, from believing intelligence is fixed and unchangeable, to believing it is malleable and can be improved with effort. A belief in malleable intelligence leads to adaptive responses to challenge and higher achievement. However, surprisingly little is known about the development of academic-domain-specific theories of intelligence (i.e., math vs. reading and writing). The authors examined this in a cross-section of students from 1st grade to college (N = 523). They also examined whether students hold different beliefs about the role of fixed ability in adult jobs versus their own grade. The authors' adult-specific beliefs hypothesis states that when children learn societally held beliefs from adults, they first apply these beliefs specifically to adults and later to students their own age. Consistent with this, even the youngest students (1st and 2nd graders) believed that success in an adult job requires more fixed ability in math than reading and writing. However, when asked about students in their own grade, only high school and college students reported that math involves more fixed ability than reading and writing. High school and college students' math-specific theories of intelligence were related to their motivation and achievement in math, controlling for reading and writing-specific theories. Reading and writing-specific theories did not predict reading and writing-specific motivations or achievement, perhaps because students perceive reading and writing as less challenging than math. In summary, academic-domain-specific theories of intelligence develop early but may not become self-relevant until adolescence, and math-specific beliefs may be especially important targets for intervention. (PsycINFO Database Record", "This study compared the levels of the five domains of neurocognitive function-executive function, attention, memory, verbal comprehension, and perceptual organization-among clinically stable individuals with long-term bipolar I disorder, individuals with long-term schizophrenia, and a group of controls. We recruited a total of 93 clinically stable individuals with bipolar I disorder, 94 individuals with schizophrenia, and 106 controls in this study. Their neurocognitive function was measured using a series of neurocognitive function tests: the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Third Edition (WAIS-III), Line Cancellation Test, Visual Form Discrimination, Controlled Oral Word Association Test, Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, Continuous Performance Task, and Wechsler Memory Scale-Third Edition. Neurocognitive function was compared among the three groups through a multivariate analysis of variance. The results indicated that when the effect of age was controlled, clinically stable individuals with bipolar I disorder and those with schizophrenia demonstrated poor neurocognitive function on all tests except for the WAIS-III Similarity and Information and the Line Cancellation Test. The individuals with bipolar I disorder had similar levels of neurocognitive function compared with the schizophrenia group, but higher levels of neurocognitive function on the WAIS-III Comprehension, Controlled Oral Word Association Test, and Wechsler Memory Scale-Third Edition Auditory Immediate and Delayed Index and Visual Immediate and Delayed Index. The conclusions of this study suggest that compared with controls, individuals with long-term bipolar I disorder and those with long-term schizophrenia have poorer neurocognitive function, even when clinically stable. Individuals with long-term bipolar I disorder and those with long-term schizophrenia have similar levels of deficits in several domains of neurocognitive function.", "In 2016, 13 topics were selected as major research advances in gynecologic oncology. For ovarian cancer, study results supporting previous ones regarding surgical preventive strategies were reported. There were several targeted agents that showed comparable responses in phase III trials, including niraparib, cediranib, and nintedanib. On the contrary to our expectations, dose-dense weekly chemotherapy regimen failed to prove superior survival outcomes compared with conventional triweekly regimen. Single-agent non-platinum treatment to prolong platinum-free-interval in patients with recurrent, partially platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer did not improve and even worsened overall survival (OS). For cervical cancer, we reviewed robust evidences of larger-scaled population-based study and cost-effectiveness of nonavalent vaccine for expanding human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine coverage. Standard of care treatment of locally advanced cervical cancer (LACC) was briefly reviewed. For uterine corpus cancer, new findings about appropriate surgical wait time from diagnosis to surgery were reported. Advantages of minimally invasive surgery over conventional laparotomy were reconfirmed. There were 5 new gene regions that increase the risk of developing endometrial cancer. Regarding radiation therapy, Post-Operative Radiation Therapy in Endometrial Cancer (PORTEC)-3 quality of life (QOL) data were released and higher local control rate of image-guided adaptive brachytherapy was reported in LACC. In addition, 4 general oncology topics followed: chemotherapy at the end-of-life, immunotherapy with reengineering T-cells, actualization of precision medicine, and artificial intelligence (AI) to make personalized cancer therapy real. For breast cancer, adaptively randomized trials, extending aromatase inhibitor therapy, and ribociclib and palbociclib were introduced.", "Although multitasking with media has increased dramatically in recent years (Rideout, Foehr, & Roberts, 2010), the association between media multitasking and cognitive performance is poorly understood. In addition, the literature on the relationship between media multitasking and task-switching, one measure of cognitive control, has produced mixed results (Alzahabi & Becker, 2013; Minear et al., 2013; Ophir, Nass, & Wagner, 2009). Here we use an individual differences approach to investigate the relationship between media multitasking and task-switching performance by first examining the structure of task-switching and identifying the latent factors that contribute to switch costs. Participants performed a series of 3 different task-switching paradigms, each designed to isolate the effects of a specific putative mechanism (e.g., advanced preparation) related to task-switching performance, as well as a series of surveys to measure media multitasking and intelligence. The results suggest that task-switching performance is related to 2 somewhat independent factors, namely an advanced preparation factor and passive decay factor. In addition, multitasking with media was related to a faster ability to prepare for tasks, resulting in faster task-switching performance without a cost to accuracy. Media multitasking and intelligence were both unrelated to passive decay factors. These findings are consistent with a 2-component model of task-switching (Sohn & Anderson, 2001), as well as an automatic/executive framework of cognitive control (Schneider & Shiffrin, 1977). (PsycINFO Database Record", "Research on intelligence, mainly based on correlational and factor-analytical work, research on cognitive development, and research in cognitive psychology are not to be opposed as has traditionally been the case, but are pursuing the same goal, that is, understand how the human being adapts to his/her own, complex environment. Each tradition of research has been focusing on one source of variation, namely situational differences for cognitive psychology, individual differences for psychometrics, and age differences for developmental psychology, while usually neglecting the two other sources of variation. The present paper compares those trends of research with respect to the constructs of fluid intelligence, working memory, processing speed, inhibition, and executive schemes. Two studies are very briefly presented to support the suggestion that tasks issued from these three traditions are very similar, if not identical, and that theoretical issues are also similar. We conclude in arguing that a unified vision is possible, provided one is (a) interested in the underlying processes and not only in the experimental variations of conditions; (b) willing to adopt a multidimensional view according to which few general mechanisms are at work, such as working memory or processing capacity, inhibition, and executive schemes; and (c) granting a fundamental role to individual differences.", "Emotional intelligence (EI) refers to the composite set of capabilities that enable a person to identify, assess, understand, and control emotions of oneself and others. This study was conducted to assess trait EI, to examine possible differences in the EI level of medical students in terms of gender, and to investigate the correlation between EI of medical students and their academic performance.\nWe used a cross-sectional survey consisting of a self-assessment questionnaire distributed to 200 undergraduate medical students after informed consent. Subjects responded on a five-point Likert scale. Data obtained were examined using descriptive frequencies, percentages, and correlations and analyzed with SPSS software.\nSixty-five percent of medical students had high EI. EI was significantly higher in females (72.27\u00b1 8.84) compared to males (67.47\u00b1 15.43) (P = 0.007). There was a positive correlation between EI and academic performance (r = 0.51).\nEI is a necessary component of medical students' skill sets to ensure that they are not only knowledgeable and academically competent in medical school but will also succeed in the future as quality healthcare professionals. There should be a balance between intelligence quotient and EI in students' learning processes to ensure success both personally and professionally. Students with good EI tend to be skilled at interpreting emotions; skills which, in turn, will add on to their performance in medical training and patient care.", "The current study investigated a longitudinal data set of 4790 adults examining a set of socio-demographic and psychological factors that influence adult financial well-being. Parental social status (at birth), childhood intelligence and self-esteem (at age 10), locus of control (at age 16), psychological distress (age 30), educational qualifications (age 34), current occupation, weekly net income, house ownership status, and number of rooms (all measured at age 38 years) were examined. Structural Equation Modelling showed that childhood intelligence, locus of control, education and occupation were all independent predictors of adult financial well-being for both men and women. Parental social status and psychological distress were also significant predictors of the outcome variable for men, but not for women. Whereas for women, in comparison to men, the effects of current occupation and childhood intelligence on the outcome variable appeared to be stronger. The strongest predictor of adult financial well-being was current occupational prestige, followed by educational achievement. The gender deferential of financial well-being indicators and its implications are discussed.", "Spatial abilities are generally hypothesized to differ between men and women, and people with different sexual orientations. According to the cross-sex shift hypothesis, gay men are hypothesized to perform in the direction of heterosexual women and lesbian women in the direction of heterosexual men on cognitive tests. This study investigated sexual orientation differences in spatial navigation and strategy during a virtual Morris water maze task (VMWM). Forty-four heterosexual men, 43 heterosexual women, 39 gay men, and 34 lesbian/bisexual women (aged 18-54\u00a0years) navigated a desktop VMWM and completed measures of intelligence, handedness, and childhood gender nonconformity (CGN). We quantified spatial learning (hidden platform trials), probe trial performance, and cued navigation (visible platform trials). Spatial strategies during hidden and probe trials were classified into visual scanning, landmark use, thigmotaxis/circling, and enfilading. In general, heterosexual men scored better than women and gay men on some spatial learning and probe trial measures and used more visual scan strategies. However, some differences disappeared after controlling for age and estimated IQ (e.g., in visual scanning heterosexual men differed from women but not gay men). Heterosexual women did not differ from lesbian/bisexual women. For both sexes, visual scanning predicted probe trial performance. More feminine CGN scores were associated with lower performance among men and greater performance among women on specific spatial learning or probe trial measures. These results provide mixed evidence for the cross-sex shift hypothesis of sexual orientation-related differences in spatial cognition.", "This paper describes the experiences of underrepresented BSc nursing students in realising the dream of becoming a nurse in one university. In the past ten years, pre-registration nurse education has become established within higher education in Ireland. This development includes promoting access and inclusion of students from traditionally underrepresented groups in higher education. A third of nursing students currently access places on programmes through routes specifically designed for underrepresented groups.\nA qualitative descriptive study design provided an opportunity for student voices to be heard. Ethical approval was sought and granted. Eleven students were interviewed nearing completion of a four year BSc Nursing programme. Data analysis followed a thematic approach, in generating themes.\nThree themes emerged from the data: taking the first steps; finding a way and getting through. Findings highlight participants' challenges in balancing study, clinical practice and family life in achieving and realising their dream of becoming a nurse.\nThis study illustrates the nature and complexities of participants' experiences throughout the BSc Nursing programmes towards becoming university graduates, eligible for registration as a nurse. Students from underrepresented groups bring rich and diverse life experiences in preparation for and becoming caring practitioners. It highlights the individuality within participants' experiences and draws attention to the value of personalised support for students. An opportunity to encourage the development of emotional intelligence needs to be fostered within nurse education programmes. Creating positive learning environments is critical to supporting student understanding of compassionate patient centred care. Findings have relevance for global curriculum design and structures to support individual student centred engagement. Further research is required to consider how best to support students from underrepresented groups.", "Case reports of life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias and sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) among amphetamine users have raised serious concerns about the cardiac safety of this class of drugs. This is important in light of the high prevalence of dexamphetamine (dAMPH) prescription for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and its rising use as a recreational drug. The objective was to investigate electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters upon intravenous administration of a single dAMPH dose in habitual recreational dAMPH users (users) and healthy gender/age/ intelligence-quotient-matched controls (non-users).\nECG recordings were made in 18 users and 18 non-users during administration of dAMPH (0.3 mg/kg body weight). Baseline ECG was normal in both groups. dAMPH elicited increased heart rate and corrected QT time (QTc) prolongation in both groups (all P < 0.001, QTc = 502 in one individual). QTc prolongation was attenuated in users compared to non-users, exhibiting a significant interaction effect (P = 0.04).\nSCA associated with amphetamine use may be related to its QTc prolonging effects, particularly during first-time use. These observations may provide a rationale for conducting ECG analysis immediately after the first-time use of amphetamines, as this could potentially unmask vulnerable individuals.", "An outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) began in Guinea in December 2013 and was declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by the World Health Organization in August 2014. In October, the UK government tasked Public Health England (PHE) to set up EVD screening at key ports. The key aim of port-of-entry screening was to identify passengers coming from areas with high risk of EVD, and give them advice to raise their awareness of symptoms and what actions to take. Direct flights from Sierra Leone, Guinea or Liberia had all been cancelled, so intelligence on passenger numbers and routes was used to identify the most commonly used routes from the affected countries into the UK. One of these was St Pancras International train station. Screening had never previously been implemented at a UK train station so had to be set up from scratch. Key to the success of this was excellent multi-agency working between PHE, the UK Border Force, Eurostar, Network Rail and the Cabinet Office. This paper gives an overview of the activation of EVD screening at St Pancras International and the subsequent decommissioning.", "BackgroundPreterm birth is a risk for cognitive development. This study assessed the cognitive profile of children born very preterm at the age of 11 years as well as the associated risk factors.MethodsA total of 128 children born very preterm were included. Magnetic resonance imaging was performed at term age. Cognitive development was assessed using the full-scale intelligence quotient (IQ) and four domains of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, fourth edition (WISC-IV), Finnish translation. The results were compared with test norms.ResultsMost study children performed at average (51%) or low average (21%) levels in the full-scale IQ assessment. The correlation between 5- and 11-year full-scale IQ was 0.73 (P<0.001). Compared with the normative data, children born very preterm performed poorer in all domains of the cognitive profile. The only significant risk factor for poor general cognition was major brain pathology. When considering all four domains of WISC-IV, low paternal education, male gender, and low birth weight z score were also found to be significant risk factors.ConclusionsLess than one-third of the children born very preterm performed below the low average cognitive level at 11 years of age. Specific neonatal and sociodemographic risk factors were identified as affecting the cognitive profile.", "Although cognitive deficits are a well-established feature of bipolar disorders (BD), even during periods of euthymia, little is known about cognitive phenotype heterogeneity among patients with BD.\nWe investigated neuropsychological performance in 258 euthymic patients with BD recruited via the French network of expert centers for BD. We used a test battery assessing six domains of cognition. Hierarchical cluster analysis of the cross-sectional data was used to determine the optimal number of subgroups and to assign each patient to a specific cognitive cluster. Subsequently, subjects from each cluster were compared on demographic, clinical functioning, and pharmacological variables.\nA four-cluster solution was identified. The global cognitive performance was above normal in one cluster and below normal in another. The other two clusters had a near-normal cognitive performance, with above and below average verbal memory, respectively. Among the four clusters, significant differences were observed in estimated intelligence quotient and social functioning, which were lower for the low cognitive performers compared to the high cognitive performers.\nThese results confirm the existence of several distinct cognitive profiles in BD. Identification of these profiles may help to develop profile-specific cognitive remediation programs, which might improve functioning in BD.", "Emotional labour is the effort consumed by suppressing one's own emotions to care for others effectively while also caring for oneself. Mental health nurses are required to engage in effective therapeutic interactions in emotionally-intense situations. The aim of the present integrative systematic review was to investigate the emotional labour of mental health work and how this manifested, the impacts, and the ways to mitigate these impacts. In June 2016, using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses methodology, a systematic search of the bibliographic databases was undertaken to identify relevant literature. Screening, data extraction, and synthesis were performed by three reviewers. The inclusion criteria included any original research that investigated the emotional work of mental health nurses. We identified a total of 20 papers to be included in this review. Thematic synthesis of the findings revealed three emergent themes: emotional labour and caring, emotional exhaustion, and self-protection (expressed as emotional intelligence). Emotional labour, emotional exhaustion, and emotional intelligence were considered to be intrinsically linked, where they were both the influencing factor for burnout and a contributor to attrition. The results highlighted that emotional labour could inspire the development and personal growth of emotional intelligence in mental health nurses. In light of these findings, recommendations for clinical practice were considered; they included supportive work environments, involving nurses in shared decision-making, and the provision of ongoing professional development opportunities that facilitate the development of emotional intelligence and resilience.", "This article investigates the ostensibly paradoxical relationship that exists between the theme of excessive love, as suggested by the title of Abhishek Chaubey's film Dedh Ishqiya (2014), and the actual representation of it in the movie, which is not only restrained and disproportionate, but is also looked at with suspicion and contempt. It examines the logic of this seeming contradiction through the other two related themes that Chaubey's chef-d'\u0153uvre foregrounds, namely that of intelligence and female desire. The quest for financial autonomy that the female protagonists of the movie are involved in-a necessary pre-condition for leading independent lives-is so inextricably intertwined with manipulation, dexterity, and subterfuge, that any overt expression of homoerotic female desire can only jeopardize their existing possibilities of self-aggrandizement. The heteronormative arrangements of Begum Para's palace thus constitute the elaborate mise en sc\u00e8ne, behind which female desire is enacted through a politics of intelligence, resourcefulness, discretion, and anonymity. Through this strategic negotiation, which is also a tactical necessity, the female protagonists are not only able to con the con men in the movie, but also imagine alternative subject positions that recognize the need for both pragmatism and expediency as well as deconstructing heteropatriarchal economies of desire.", "The present study examined the extent to which the covariance structure of the WAIS-IV is best accounted for by models that assume that test performance is the result of group-level factors and multiple independent general factors.\nStructural models with one to four general factors were evaluated with either four or five group-level factors. Simulations based on four general factors were run to clarify the adequacy of the estimates of the allocation of covariance by the models.\nFour independent general factors provided better fit than a single general factor for either model with four or five group-level factors. While one of the general factors had much larger loadings than all other factors, simulation results suggested that this might be an artifact of the statistical procedure rather than a reflection of the nature of individual differences in cognitive abilities.\nThese results argue against the contention that clinical interpretation of cognitive test batteries should primarily be at the level of general intelligence. It is a fallacy to assume that factor analysis can reveal the structure of human abilities. Test validity should not be based solely on the results of modeling the covariance of test batteries.", "This study investigates the development of theory of mind (ToM) in Japanese children with hearing loss (HL) and its relationship with language abilities using the data of a large sample size.\nParticipants were 369 children with HL, ranging from 4 to 12 years of age. The mean hearing level of the better ear was 100.7\u00a0dB. A \"change in location\"-type false belief task similar to the \"Sally-Anne test\" was given to the participants.\nThe pass rates for the false belief task were in the 20% range for 4 to 6-year-olds, 35.6% for 7-year-olds, 47.6% for 8-year-olds, and 63.6% for 9-year-olds. However, no children, even 12-year-olds, achieved a pass rate of 70%. A logistic regression analysis showed that the significant independent predictors of the false belief task performance were vocabulary age and syntactic comprehension level, and chronological age, hearing level, syntactic production level, and nonverbal intelligence were excluded.\nThe results demonstrate that there is a delay in the development of ToM in Japanese children with HL. This finding is consistent with findings in English-speaking countries. Additionally, it is suggested that language abilities play an important role in the acquisition of ToM for children with HL.", "The quality of the home environment, as a predictor, is related to health, education, and emotion outcomes. However, factors influencing the quality of the home environment, as an outcome, have been understudied-particularly how children construct their own environments. Further, most previous research on family processes and outcomes has implemented between-family designs, which limit claims of causality. The present study uses kinship data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth to construct a maternal sibling-comparison design to investigate how maternal and child traits predict the quality of home environment. Using a standard between-family analysis, we first replicate previous research showing a relationship between maternal intelligence and the quality of the home environment. Then, we reevaluate the link between maternal intelligence and the home environment using differences between maternal sisters on several characteristics to explain differences between home environments for their children. Following, we evaluate whether child intelligence differences are related to home environment differences in the presence of maternal characteristics. Results are compared with those from the between-family analysis. Past causal interpretations are challenged by our findings, and the role of child intelligence in the construction of the home environment emerges as a critical contributor that increases in importance with development. (PsycINFO Database Record", "Problems with pragmatic aspects of language are well attested in individuals on the autism spectrum. It remains unclear, however, whether figurative language skills improve with language status and whether problems in figurative language are no longer present in highly verbal individuals with autism.\nTo investigate whether highly verbal individuals with autism perform similarly as age-, intelligence- and verbal comprehension-matched controls on the processing of one of the most common types of figurative language, metaphors. The goal was to establish whether the participants with autism are primed similarly to controls by figurative expressions (metaphors) presented in different conditions.\nThe experiment was designed as a cross-modal lexical-decision task where metaphors served as primes for target words related to their figurative or literal meaning.\nOur findings show that both ASD and control participants made very few errors in the experimental task. However, the participants with ASD presented with problems in performance on the task, reflected in significantly slower reaction times compared with the typically developing peer groups. The similar response speed observed between the younger typical control children and the adult ASD participants suggests that the mechanisms underlying metaphor processing (e.g., selection of metaphorical versus literal interpretation) are still developing in high-functioning autism, very much like in typical children.\nThese results may suggest that metaphor processing requires more than adequate language competences. The findings are also suggestive of a delay in developing sensitivity to figurative language, rather than sheer inability. This suggests that a timely training programme can be implemented to improve figurative language abilities in ASD.", "Markov logic networks (MLNs) reconcile two opposing schools in machine learning and artificial intelligence: causal networks, which account for uncertainty extremely well, and first-order logic, which allows for formal deduction. An MLN is essentially a first-order logic template to generate Markov networks. Inference in MLNs is probabilistic and it is often performed by approximate methods such as Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Gibbs sampling. An MLN has many regular, symmetric structures that can be exploited at both first-order level and in the generated Markov network. We analyze the graph structures that are produced by various lifting methods and investigate the extent to which quantum protocols can be used to speed up Gibbs sampling with state preparation and measurement schemes. We review different such approaches, discuss their advantages, theoretical limitations, and their appeal to implementations. We find that a straightforward application of a recent result yields exponential speedup compared to classical heuristics in approximate probabilistic inference, thereby demonstrating another example where advanced quantum resources can potentially prove useful in machine learning.", "A DSM-5 diagnosis of attention deficit/hyperactive disorder (ADHD) requires that symptoms be present in two settings. We wanted to see how teachers and parents compare on their assessments.\nWe evaluated how well Child Symptom Inventory-4 (CSI-4) reports from 871 parents and 634 teachers of 10-year-old children born before the 28th week of gestation provided information about indicators of school dysfunction.\nKappa values for parent and teacher agreement of any ADHD were at best fair to poor (<0.41). Nevertheless, ADHD identified by each alone provided a moderate amount of information about such indicators of school dysfunction as grade repetition. Only occasionally did agreement provide more information than provided by only one reporter. Mother's social class and intelligence level did not discriminate between parents who did and did not agree with the teacher.\nADHD identified by a single observer can provide appreciable information about a range of the child's functions needed for success in school and, therefore, should not be discounted when another observer does not consider the child to have ADHD symptoms.", "The purpose of this study is to investigate word learning in children with dyslexia to ascertain their strengths and weaknesses during the configuration stage of word learning.\nChildren with typical development (N = 116) and dyslexia (N = 68) participated in computer-based word learning games that assessed word learning in 4 sets of games that manipulated phonological or visuospatial demands. All children were monolingual English-speaking 2nd graders without oral language impairment. The word learning games measured children's ability to link novel names with novel objects, to make decisions about the accuracy of those names and objects, to recognize the semantic features of the objects, and to produce the names of the novel words. Accuracy data were analyzed using analyses of covariance with nonverbal intelligence scores as a covariate.\nWord learning deficits were evident for children with dyslexia across every type of manipulation and on 3 of 5 tasks, but not for every combination of task/manipulation. Deficits were more common when task demands taxed phonology. Visuospatial manipulations led to both disadvantages and advantages for children with dyslexia.\nChildren with dyslexia evidence spoken word learning deficits, but their performance is highly dependent on manipulations and task demand, suggesting a processing trade-off between visuospatial and phonological demands.", "The aim of this study was to answer the question of how much information about embryo implantation potential can be obtained from morphokinetic parameters through the creation a predictive model based on morphokinetic information and using advanced data-mining and artificial intelligence methods.\nTime-lapse recordings of 610 embryos were included in the analysis. For each embryo, absolute (t2, t3, t4, t5) and relative (cc2 and s2) morphokinetic parameters were collected. Additionally, fragmentation levels assessed at t2, t3, t4 and t5 time-points, presence of multinucleation, evenness of blastomeres after the first and second division and women's age were included in the analysis.\nThe created predictive model of implantation was constructed on the basis of two advanced data-mining methods: principal component analysis (PCA) and artificial neural networks (ANN). The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve constructed for the created model demonstrated its good quality. The area under the ROC curve was AUC=0.75 with a 95% confidence interval (0.70, 0.80). Finally, the model was verified on a validation set and the results were also good, although slightly weaker: AUC=0.71, with a 95% confidence interval (0.59, 0.84).\nThe combination of two data-mining algorithms: PCA and ANN may be considered a method which can extract virtually all the available information from data. This methodology is indeed efficient, but models presented in the literature are also effective and close to the limit of the maximal information which can be extracted from morphokinetic data. The limit can be determined at the level of AUC value marginally above 0.7.", "The aim of this study was to verify the applicability of the Test of Moral Reasoning (TMR) in the selection of job applicants and to see how it correlated with education, intelligence, and the \"big five\" personality traits. The study included 210 participants (132 women and 78 men) who applied for various positions in the banking sector. Our findings have confirmed the applicability of TMR for recruitment because they showed that TMR did not allow the candidates to fake their responses. Furthermore, they have confirmed Kohlberg's views that general intelligence and education are the main determinants of moral development (positive correlation), whereas tendency towards socially desirable responding showed a negative correlation.", "The Hawaiian crow has been revealed as a skilled tool user, confirmed by testing the last members of this endangered species that survive in captivity. The finding suggests its behavior is tantalizingly similar to that of the famous tool-using New Caledonian crow and has implications for the evolution of tool use and intelligence in birds.", "Managing diversity dynamics in academic or clinical settings for men in nursing has unique challenges resulting from their minority status within the profession.\nThe purpose of this study was to share challenges and lessons learned identified by male scholars in the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Nurse Faculty Scholars program and suggest strategies for creating positive organizations promoting inclusive excellence.\nMultiple strategies including informal mentored discussions and peer-to-peer dialogue throughout the program, formal online surveys of scholars and National Advisory Committee members, and review of scholar progress reports were analyzed as part of the comprehensive evaluation plan of the program.\nDiversity dynamic issues include concerns with negative stereotyping, microaggression, gender intelligence, and differences in communication and leadership styles.\nMale nurse faculty scholars report experiencing both opportunities and challenges residing in a predominately female profession. This article attempts to raise awareness and suggest strategies to manage diversity dynamics in service of promoting the development of a culture of health that values diversity and inclusive excellence for both men and women in academic, research, and practice contexts.", "The Hemiconvulsions-Hemiplegia-Epilepsy (HHE) syndrome is currently regarded as an extremely rare condition. The etiological and pathophysiological mechanisms underlying this medical rarity as well as the optimal therapeutic approaches remain poorly defined and understood. We present the clinical, radiological and electroencephalography (EEG) findings of a patient with the HHE syndrome and describe the response of the continuously present epileptiform abnormalities to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS).\nA 33-year old male patient was referred to our department for investigation and management of intractable epilepsy. His seizures began at the age of three months when, during the course of a common febrile illness, he developed repetitive clonic seizures involving the left upper and lower limbs, followed by permanent left hemiplegia. After extensive investigations, he was diagnosed with \"idiopathic\" HHE syndrome. Currently, he suffers from left hemiplegia, severe intellectual impairment [Intelligence Quotient (IQ) <30] and asymmetric, bilateral tonic seizures occurring 1-3 times daily despite treatment with valproate, topiramate, lamotrigine, rufinamide, and perampanel. Brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed atrophy of the right hemisphere and serial EEGs disclosed continuous sharp waves, the generators of which were localized by electrical source imaging (ESI) to two distinct sources within the right hemisphere. Repetitive TMS [210 stimuli of 1 Hz at 100 % corticomotor threshold applied with a circular coil over the generators of epileptic discharges (EDs)] resulted in a statistically significant decrease of ED counts compared to sham stimulation and the post-verum TMS period.\nWe present the clinical-laboratory profile and the long-term follow up of a patient with the HHE syndrome. Further, we describe the effects of TMS on EDs. The latter observation raises the possibility that TMS-EEG may be used in select cases with intractable epilepsy as a surrogate marker of responsiveness to more invasive modalities (i.e., cortical stimulation).

Drug repositioning has great promise and when combined with today's computational power and intelligence it becomes more precise and potent. This work showcases current approaches of creating a computational pipeline for drug repositioning, along with an extensive example of how researchers can influence therapeutic approaches and further understanding, through either single or multiple disease studies. This paradigm is based on three neurodegenerative diseases with pathophysiological similarities. It is our goal to provide the readers with all the information needed to enrich their research and note expectations along the way.", "Up to 60% of patients with bipolar disorder (BD) have a history of traumatic events, which is associated with greater episode severity, higher risk of comorbidity and higher relapse rates. Trauma-focused treatment strategies for BD are thus necessary but studies are currently scarce. The aim of this study is to examine whether Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) therapy focusing on adherence, insight, de-idealisation of manic symptoms, prodromal symptoms and mood stabilization can reduce episode severity and relapse rates and increase cognitive performance and functioning in patients with BD.\nThis is a single-blind, randomized controlled, multicentre trial in which 82 patients with BD and a history of traumatic events will be recruited and randomly allocated to one of two treatment arms: EMDR therapy or supportive therapy. Patients in both groups will receive 20 psychotherapeutic sessions, 60\u00a0min each, during 6\u00a0months. The primary outcome is a reduction of affective episodes after 12 and 24\u00a0months in favour of the EMDR group. As secondary outcome we postulate a greater reduction in affective symptoms in the EMDR group (as measured by the Bipolar Depression Rating Scale, the Young Mania Rating Scale and the Clinical Global Impression Scale modified for BD), and a better performance in cognitive state, social cognition and functioning (as measured by the Screen for Cognitive Impairment in Psychiatry, The Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test and the Functioning Assessment Short Test, respectively). Traumatic events will be evaluated by The Holmes-Rahe Life Stress Inventory, the Clinician-administered PTSD Scale and the Impact of Event Scale.\nThe results of this study will provide evidence whether a specific EMDR protocol for patients with BD is effective in reducing affective episodes, affective symptoms and functional, cognitive and trauma symptoms.\nThe trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier: NCT02634372 . Registered on 3 December 2015.", "The purpose of this study was to assess whether the differential effects of working memory (WM) components (the central executive, phonological loop, and visual-spatial sketchpad) on math word problem-solving accuracy in children (N\u2009=\u2009413, ages 6-10) are completely mediated by reading, calculation, and fluid intelligence. The results indicated that all three WM components predicted word problem solving in the nonmediated model, but only the storage component of WM yielded a significant direct path to word problem-solving accuracy in the fully mediated model. Fluid intelligence was found to moderate the relationship between WM and word problem solving, whereas reading, calculation, and related skills (naming speed, domain-specific knowledge) completely mediated the influence of the executive system on problem-solving accuracy. Our results are consistent with findings suggesting that storage eliminates the predictive contribution of executive WM to various measures Colom, Rebollo, Abad, & Shih (Memory & Cognition, 34: 158-171, 2006). The findings suggest that the storage component of WM, rather than the executive component, has a direct path to higher-order processing in children.", "Gastric tubes are commonly used for the administration of drugs and tube feeding for people who are unable to swallow. Feeding via a tube misplaced in the trachea can result in severe pneumonia. Therefore, the confirmation of tube placement in the stomach after tube insertion is important. Recent studies have reported that ultrasonography provides good diagnostic accuracy estimates in the confirmation of appropriate tube placement. Hence, ultrasound could provide a promising alternative to X-rays in the confirmation of tube placement, especially in settings where X-ray facilities are unavailable or difficult to access.\nTo assess the diagnostic accuracy of ultrasound for gastric tube placement confirmation.\nWe searched the Cochrane Library (2016, Issue 3), MEDLINE (to March 2016), Embase (to March 2016), National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) PROSPERO Register (to May 2016), Aggressive Research Intelligence Facility Databases (to May 2016), ClinicalTrials.gov (to May 2016), ISRCTN registry (May 2016), World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (to May 2016) and reference lists of articles, and contacted study authors.\nWe included studies that evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of naso- and orogastric tube placement confirmed by ultrasound visualization using X-ray visualization as the reference standard. We included cross-sectional studies, and case-control studies. We excluded case series or case reports. Studies were excluded if X-ray visualization was not the reference standard or if the tube being placed was a gastrostomy or enteric tube.\nTwo review authors independently assessed the risk of bias and extracted data from each of the included studies. We contacted authors of the included studies to obtain missing data.\nWe identified 10 studies (545 participants and 560 tube insertions) which met our inclusion criteria.No study was assigned low risk of bias or low concern in every QUADAS-2 domain. We judged only three (30%) studies to have low risk of bias in the participant selection domain because they performed ultrasound after they confirmed correct position by other methods.Few data (43 participants) were available for misplacement detection (specificity) due to the low incidence of misplacement. We did not perform a meta-analysis because of considerable heterogeneity of the index test such as the difference of echo window, the combination of ultrasound with other confirmation methods (e.g. saline flush visualization by ultrasound) and ultrasound during the insertion of the tube. For all settings, sensitivity estimates for individual studies ranged from 0.50 to 1.00 and specificity estimates from 0.17 to 1.00. For settings where X-ray was not readily available and participants underwent gastric tube insertion for drainage (four studies, 305 participants), sensitivity estimates of ultrasound in combination with other confirmatory tests ranged from 0.86 to 0.98 and specificity estimates of 1.00 with wide confidence intervals.For the studies using ultrasound alone (four studies, 314 participants), sensitivity estimates ranged from 0.91 to 0.98 and specificity estimates from 0.67 to 1.00.\nOf 10 studies that assessed the diagnostic accuracy of gastric tube placement, few studies had a low risk of bias. Based on limited evidence, ultrasound does not have sufficient accuracy as a single test to confirm gastric tube placement. However, in settings where X-ray is not readily available, ultrasound may be useful to detect misplaced gastric tubes. Larger studies are needed to determine the possibility of adverse events when ultrasound is used to confirm tube placement.", "Irish educational psychologists frequently use the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children - Fourth UK Edition (WISC-IVUK ; Wechsler, 2004, Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Fourth UK Edition, London, UK, Harcourt Assessment) in clinical assessments of children with learning difficulties. Unfortunately, reliability and validity studies of the WISC-IVUK standardization sample have not yet been reported. Watkins et\u00a0al. (2013, International Journal of School and Educational Psychology, 1, 102) found support for a bifactor structure with a large sample (N\u00a0=\u00a0794) of Irish children who were administered the 10 WISC-IVUK core subtests in clinical assessments of learning difficulties and dominance of general intelligence. Because only 10 subtests were available, Cattell-Horn-Carroll (CHC; McGrew, 1997, 2005, Contemporary intellectual assessment: Theories, tests, and issues, New York, NY: Guilford; Schneider & McGrew, 2012, Contemporary intellectual assessment: Theories, tests, and issues, New York, NY, Guilford Press) models could not be tested and compared.\nThe present study utilized confirmatory factor analyses to test the latent factor structure of the WISC-IVUK with a sample of 245 Irish children administered all 15 WISC-IVUK subtests in evaluations assessing learning difficulties in order to examine CHC- and Wechsler-based models. One through five, oblique first-order factor models and higher order versus bifactor models were examined and compared using CFA.\nMeaningful differences in fit statistics were not observed between the Wechsler and CHC representations of higher-order or bifactor models. In all four structures, general intelligence accounted for the largest portions of explained common variance, whereas group factors accounted for small to miniscule portions of explained common variance. Omega-hierarchical subscale coefficients indicated that unit-weighted composites that would be generated by WISC-IVUK group factors (Wechsler or CHC) would contain little unique variance and thus be of little value.\nThese results were similar to those from other investigations, further demonstrating the replication of the WISC-IV factor structure across cultures and the importance of focusing primary interpretation on the FSIQ.", "We studied the emotional processes that allow people to balance two competing desires: benefitting from dishonesty and keeping a positive self-image. We recorded physiological arousal (skin conductance and heart rate) during a computer card game in which participants could cheat and fail to report a certain card when presented on the screen to avoid losing their money. We found that higher skin conductance corresponded to lower cheating rates. Importantly, emotional intelligence regulated this effect; participants with high emotional intelligence were less affected by their physiological reactions than those with low emotional intelligence. As a result, they were more likely to profit from dishonesty. However, no interaction emerged between heart rate and emotional intelligence. We suggest that the ability to manage and control emotions can allow people to overcome the tension between doing right or wrong and license them to bend the rules.", "This article will identify the challenges that post 9/11 law enforcement faces regarding privatepublic partnerships and describe in detail the NYPD Shield programme, created to combat those challenges. Recommendations made by the 911 Commission included the incorporation of the private sector into future homeland security strategies. One such strategy is NYPD Shield. This programme is a nationally recognized award-winning public-private partnership dedicated to providing counterterrorism training and information sharing with government agencies, non-government organizations, private businesses, and the community. Information is shared through several platforms that include a dedicated website, instruction of counterterrorism training curricula, e-mail alerts, intelligence assessments and the hosting of quarterly conferences. This article also details how the NYPD Shield is providing its successful template to other law enforcement agencies enabling them to initiate similar programmes in their respective jurisdictions, and in doing so joining a National Shield Network.", "This study aimed to investigate the impact of mild to severe pediatric TBI on the structural connectome. Children aged 8-14 years with trauma control (TC) injury (n = 27) were compared to children with mild TBI and risk factors for complicated TBI (mildRF+ , n = 20) or moderate/severe TBI (n\u2009=\u200916) at 2.8 years post-injury. Probabilistic tractography on diffusion tensor imaging data was used in combination with graph theory to study structural connectivity. Functional outcome was measured using neurocognitive tests and parent and teacher questionnaires for behavioral functioning. The results revealed no evidence for an impact of mildRF+ TBI on the structural connectome. In contrast, the moderate/severe TBI group showed longer characteristic path length (P\u2009=\u20090.022, d\u2009=\u20090.82) than the TC group. Furthermore, longer characteristic path length was related to poorer intelligence and poorer working memory in children with TBI. In conclusion, children have abnormal organization of the structural connectome after moderate/severe TBI, which may be implicated in neurocognitive dysfunction associated with pediatric TBI. These findings should be interpreted in the context of our exploratory analyses, which indicate that the definition and weighting of connectivity (e.g., streamline density, fractional anisotropy) influence the properties of the reconstructed connectome and its sensitivity to the impact and outcome of pediatric TBI.

Consequently, efforts have been made to improve personal and group performance in EI, mostly in commercial organizations. However, these programs have not been widely applied in the health field. The aim of this study is to assess the impact of a unique special EI interventional process within the framework of an active hematology-oncology unit in a general hospital.\nThis investigation employed a pre- and post-training design using the Bar-On Emotional Quotient Inventory (EQ-i) measure of EI, both before and after completion of training 10 months later. The training included personal and group EI assessments and 10 EI workshops, each 2 weeks apart and each lasting approximately 2 h. Results were compared to a control group of medical staff who did not undergo any EI training program during the same time period.\nAverage total Bar-On EQ-i level at baseline for the group was 97.9, which increased significantly after the interventional process to a score of 105.6 (P = 0.001). There were also significant increases in all five main EQ-i scales, as well as for 12 of the 15 subscales. In contrast, the control group showed no significant differences in general EI level, in any of the five main scales or 15 EI subscale areas.\nThis pilot study demonstrated the capability of a group intervention to improve EI of medical staff working in a hematology-oncological unit. The results are encouraging and suggest that the model program could be successfully applied in a large-scale interventional program.", "Children with CKD are at increased risk for neurocognitive impairment, but whether neurocognitive dysfunction is solely attributable to impaired renal function is unclear. Data from the CKD in Children Study Chronic Kidney Disease in Children (CKiD) Study indicate that a subset of children with CKD have unsuspected genomic disorders that predispose them to organ malformations and neurocognitive impairment. We therefore tested whether the CKiD Study participants with genomic disorders had impaired neurocognitive performance at enrollment. Compared with noncarriers (n=389), children with genomic disorders (n=31) scored significantly poorer on all measures of intelligence, anxiety/depressive symptoms, and executive function (differences of 0.6-0.7 SD; P=1.2\u00d710-3-2.4\u00d710-4). These differences persisted after controlling for known modifiers, including low birth weight, maternal education, seizure disorder, kidney disease duration, and genetically defined ancestry. The deleterious effect of genomic disorders on neurocognitive function was significantly attenuated in offspring of mothers with higher education, indicating the potential for modification by genetic and/or environmental factors. These data indicate that impaired neurocognitive function in some children with CKD may be attributable to genetic lesions that affect both kidney and neurocognitive development. Early identification of genomic disorders may provide opportunity for early diagnosis and personalized interventions to mitigate the effect on neurocognitive function.", "Previous research suggests that assessment of mate preferences has received relatively little psychometric attention from researchers, particularly in non-Western cultures. The current research was designed to (1) extend previous findings on long-term mate preferences by using a qualitative strategy, (2) develop a psychometrically sound scale for assessment of long-term mate preferences in men, and (3) develop a sex-neutral scale for assessment of long-term mate preferences. Six dimensions of mate preferences emerged for men: F = family/domesticity, A = attractiveness/sexuality, K = kindness/dependability, E = education/intelligence, R = religiosity/chastity, and S = status/resources. These male-specific dimensions of mate preferences showed satisfactory concurrent and convergent validity as well as high internal consistency coefficients. We mixed the female- and male-specific measures of mate preferences and arrived at 20 characteristics without culture- or sex-specific content. We further hypothesized that the 20-item scale of mate preferences would have a five-factor structure (i.e., kindness/dependability, attractiveness/sexuality, status/resources, education/intelligence, religiosity/chastity [KASER]) in men and women and that this model would replicate sex differences cited in the evolutionary psychological literature. Measurement invariance was evidenced across sexes and sex differences accorded with those in the literature. Therefore, the five-factor model of long-term mate preferences (i.e., KASER model) as measured by the Iranian Mate Preferences Scale-20 may be used to evaluate long-term mate preferences in men and women in Iran. Limitations are noted and future directions are discussed in the light of evolutionary perspective on human mating psychology.", "Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) are assuming a major role in the medical area, to grant the quality of medical assistance, supporting physicians with evidence-based information of interventions in the treatment of single pathologies. The treatment of patients affected by multiple diseases (comorbid patients) is one of the main challenges for the modern healthcare. It requires the development of new methodologies, supporting physicians in the treatment of interactions between CPGs. Several approaches have started to face such a challenging problem. However, they suffer from a substantial limitation: they do not take into account the temporal dimension. Indeed, practically speaking, interactions occur in time. For instance, the effects of two actions taken from different guidelines may potentially conflict, but practical conflicts happen only if the times of execution of such actions are such that their effects overlap in time.\nWe aim at devising a methodology to detect and analyse interactions between CPGs that considers the temporal dimension.\nIn this paper, we first extend our previous ontological model to deal with the fact that actions, goals, effects and interactions occur in time, and to model both qualitative and quantitative temporal constraints between them. Then, we identify different application scenarios, and, for each of them, we propose different types of facilities for user physicians, useful to support the temporal detection of interactions.\nWe provide a modular approach in which different Artificial Intelligence temporal reasoning techniques, based on temporal constraint propagation, are widely exploited to provide users with such facilities. We applied our methodology to two cases of comorbidities, using simplified versions of CPGs.\nWe propose an innovative approach to the detection and analysis of interactions between CPGs considering different sources of temporal information (CPGs, ontological knowledge and execution logs), which is the first one in the literature that takes into account the temporal issues, and accounts for different application scenarios.", "Objective. To determine the frequency distribution of pharmacy students across Emotionally Intelligent Leadership Inventory (EILI) measures. Methods. The EILI was administered to 235 pharmacy students at two schools. The instrument was systematically compared to the 2013 CAPE Outcomes and analyzed by confirmatory factor analysis. Results. The EILI has primary connections with pharmacy competencies related to interprofessional communication and leadership. The three facets of the EILI were verified for internal consistency (Context, \u03b1=.78; Self, \u03b1=.74; Others, \u03b1=.79). Student scores were the highest for the consciousness of self facet, with a mean score of 31.4 out of 40. Conclusion. The EILI shows promise as an instrument for use in assessing pharmacy students' emotional intelligence and leadership skills.", "Neural specificity refers to the degree to which neural representations of different stimuli can be distinguished. Evidence suggests that neural specificity, operationally defined as stimulus-related differences in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) activation patterns, declines with advancing adult age, and that individual differences in neural specificity are associated with individual differences in fluid intelligence. A growing body of literature also suggests that regular physical activity may help preserve cognitive abilities in old age. Based on this literature, we hypothesized that exercise-induced improvements in fitness would be associated with greater neural specificity among older adults. A total of 52 adults aged 59-74 years were randomly assigned to one of two aerobic-fitness training regimens, which differed in intensity. Participants in both groups trained three times a week on stationary bicycles. In the low-intensity (LI) group, the resistance was kept constant at a low level (10 Watts). In the high-intensity (HI) group, the resistance depended on participants' heart rate and therefore typically increased with increasing fitness. Before and after the 6-month training phase, participants took part in a functional MRI experiment in which they viewed pictures of faces and buildings. We used multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) to estimate the distinctiveness of neural activation patterns in ventral visual cortex (VVC) evoked by face or building stimuli. Fitness was also assessed before and after training. In line with our hypothesis, training-induced changes in fitness were positively associated with changes in neural specificity. We conclude that physical activity may protect against age-related declines in neural specificity.", "Parental age is increasing rapidly in many countries. Analysis of this potentially important influence on offspring well-being is hampered by strong secular trends and socioeconomic patterning and by a shortage of follow-up data for adult offspring. We used Swedish national data on up to 3,653,938 offspring to consider the associations of parental age with a suite of outcomes in adult offspring, comparing the results from an array of statistical methods for optimal causal inference. The offspring of older mothers had higher BMI, blood pressure, height, intelligence, non-cognitive ability and socioeconomic position. They were less likely to smoke or to be left-handed. Associations with paternal age were strongly, but not completely, attenuated by adjustment for maternal age. Estimates from the commonly-used sibling comparison method were driven primarily by a pathway mediated by offspring date of birth when outcomes showed strong secular trends. These results suggest that the intra-uterine and early life environments provided by older mothers may be detrimental to offspring cardiovascular health, but that their greater life experience and social position may bring intellectual and social advantages to their offspring. The analysis of parental age presents particular challenges, and further methodological developments are needed.", "During the fourth quarter of 2016, Cortellis Competitive Intelligence had 889 new deals added as part of its ongoing coverage of pharmaceutical licensing activity. This was an increase on both the last quarter (865) but a decrease from the same quarter for the previous year (915). This article will focus on highlighting a number of the most valuable and notable deals forged during the quarter, as well as a selection of deals from some of the most prolific deal makers. An update on milestones, options and terminated deals of significance will also be presented, along with an early outlook on the next quarter's pharmaceutical licensing activity.", "Information about Pharmacokinetics of compounds is an essential component of drug design and development. Modeling the pharmacokinetic properties require identification of the factors effecting absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of compounds. There have been continuous attempts in the prediction of intestinal absorption of compounds using various Artificial intelligence methods in the effort to reduce the attrition rate of drug candidates entering to preclinical and clinical trials. Currently, there are large numbers of individual predictive models available for absorption using machine learning approaches.\nSix Artificial intelligence methods namely, Support vector machine, k- nearest neighbor, Probabilistic neural network, Artificial neural network, Partial least square and Linear discriminant analysis were used for prediction of absorption of compounds.\nPrediction accuracy of Support vector machine, k- nearest neighbor, Probabilistic neural network, Artificial neural network, Partial least square and Linear discriminant analysis for prediction of intestinal absorption of compounds was found to be 91.54%, 88.33%, 84.30%, 86.51%, 79.07% and 80.08% respectively.\nComparative analysis of all the six prediction models suggested that Support vector machine with Radial basis function based kernel is comparatively better for binary classification of compounds using human intestinal absorption and may be useful at preliminary stages of drug design and development.", "Evidence suggests that pooling multiple independent diagnoses can improve diagnostic accuracy in well-defined tasks. We investigated whether this is also the case for diagnostics in emergency medicine, an ill-defined task environment where diagnostic errors are rife.\nA computer simulation study was conducted based on empirical data from 2 published experimental studies. In the computer experiments, 285 medical students independently diagnosed 6 simulated patients arriving at the emergency room with dyspnea. Participants' diagnoses (n = 1,710), confidence ratings, and expertise levels were entered into a computer simulation. Virtual groups of different sizes were randomly created, and 3 collective intelligence rules (follow-the-plurality rule, follow-the-most-confident rule, and follow-the-most-senior rule) were applied to combine the independent decisions into a final diagnosis. For different group sizes, the performance levels (i.e., percentage of correct diagnoses) of the 3 collective intelligence rules were compared with each other and against the average individual accuracy.\nFor all collective intelligence rules, combining independent decisions substantially increased performance relative to average individual performance. For groups of 4 or fewer, the follow-the-most-confident rule outperformed the other rules; for larger groups, the follow-the-plurality rule performed best. For example, combining 5 independent decisions using the follow-the-plurality rule increased diagnostic accuracy by 22 percentage points. These results were robust across case difficulty and expertise level. Limitations of the study include the use of simulated patients diagnosed by medical students. Whether results generalize to clinical practice is currently unknown.\nCombining independent decisions may substantially improve the quality of diagnoses in emergency medicine and may thus enhance patient safety.", "This study investigated the association of emotional intelligence (EI) and other factors with perceived stress (PS) in undergraduate dental students.\nA total of 234 undergraduate dental students at the School of Dental Sciences, Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM), in the academic year of 2009/2010, participated in this cross-sectional study. Self-administered questionnaires, the Assessing Emotions Scale and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10), were used to evaluate EI and PS, respectively.\nThe mean EI score was 121.2 (SD 11.85). The scores were significantly higher in females than males, and in students who chose dentistry based on their own interest rather than in those who were motivated by others to study dentistry. The mean PSS-10 score was 21.2 (SD 5.08). Pearson correlation analysis indicated a significant inverse relationship between EI and PSS-10 scores (r = -0.337). Multi-variable regression analysis also indicated a significant negative linear association between EI and PSS-10 scores (b = -0.156, 95% CI: -0.207, -0.104). PSS-10 scores were significantly higher for students who were in the clinical years rather than the preclinical years.\nThis study of USM undergraduate dental students shows that a low EI, female sex, and being in the clinical years were significant predictors of PS.", "Despite advances in early diagnosis and behavioral therapies, more effective treatments for children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are needed. We hypothesized that umbilical cord blood-derived cell therapies may have potential in alleviating ASD symptoms by modulating inflammatory processes in the brain. Accordingly, we conducted a phase I, open-label trial to assess the safety and feasibility of a single intravenous infusion of autologous umbilical cord blood, as well as sensitivity to change in several ASD assessment tools, to determine suitable endpoints for future trials. Twenty-five children, median age 4.6 years (range 2.26-5.97), with a confirmed diagnosis of ASD and a qualified banked autologous umbilical cord blood unit, were enrolled. Children were evaluated with a battery of behavioral and functional tests immediately prior to cord blood infusion (baseline) and 6 and 12 months later. Assessment of adverse events across the 12-month period indicated that the treatment was safe and well tolerated. Significant improvements in children's behavior were observed on parent-report measures of social communication skills and autism symptoms, clinician ratings of overall autism symptom severity and degree of improvement, standardized measures of expressive vocabulary, and objective eye-tracking measures of children's attention to social stimuli, indicating that these measures may be useful endpoints in future studies. Behavioral improvements were observed during the first 6 months after infusion and were greater in children with higher baseline nonverbal intelligence quotients. These data will serve as the basis for future studies to determine the efficacy of umbilical cord blood infusions in children with ASD.

Maternal IgG antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) can cross the placenta during pregnancy and theoretically reach the fetal brain. Some studies showed an increased number of learning disabilities in these children. Objectives To evaluate the long-term neurodevelopmental outcome of 40 children (median age 7.4 years) born to mothers with SLE and/or APS carrying positive IgG aPL during the third trimester of pregnancy. Methods Children were checked for neurological physical exam and intellectual/cognitive functioning by the Wechsler scale for corrected age. We submitted to the mothers the Child Behavior CheckList (CBCL) and a homemade set of questions created by pediatric neurologists. Results In all children neurological physical exam and intelligence levels were found to be normal. A cognitive impairment or a discrepant cognitive profile was found in 3 (7%) and 11 (28%) children, respectively. Learning disabilities were diagnosed in 3 children (19% of school-age children), all born to mothers with triple aPL positivity. A history of epilepsy was shown in four children (10%).\nChildren born to women with SLE and/or APS may need a long-term follow-up focusing on milestones of neurodevelopment in order to detect and correct any alteration as early as possible.", "This study investigated the possible impact of simulated hearing loss on speech perception in Spanish-English bilingual children. To avoid confound between individual differences in hearing-loss configuration and linguistic experience, threshold-elevating noise simulating a mild-to-moderate sloping hearing loss was used with normal-hearing listeners. The hypotheses were that: (1) bilingual children can perform similarly to English-speaking monolingual peers in quiet; (2) for both bilingual and monolingual children, noise and simulated hearing loss would have detrimental impacts consistent with their acoustic characteristics (i.e., consonants with high-frequency cues remain highly intelligible in speech-shaped noise, but suffer from simulated hearing loss more than other consonants); (3) differences in phonology and acquisition order between Spanish and English would have additional negative influence on bilingual children's recognition of some English consonants.\nListeners were 11 English-dominant, Spanish-English bilingual children (6 to 12 years old) and 12 English-speaking, monolingual age peers. All had normal hearing and age-appropriate nonverbal intelligence and expressive English vocabulary. Listeners performed a listen-and-repeat speech perception task. Targets were 13 American English consonants embedded in vowel-consonant-vowel (VCV) syllables. VCVs were presented in quiet and in speech-shaped noise at signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) of -5, 0, 5 dB (normal-hearing condition). For the simulated hearing-loss condition, threshold-elevating noise modeling a mild-to-moderate sloping sensorineural hearing loss profile was added to the normal-hearing stimuli for 0, 5 dB SNR, and quiet. Responses were scored for consonant correct. Individual listeners' performance was summarized for average across 13 consonants (overall) and for individual consonants.\nGroups were compared for the effects of background noise and simulated hearing loss. As predicted, group performed similarly in quiet. The simulated hearing loss had a considerable detrimental impact on both groups, even in the absence of speech-shaped noise. Contrary to our prediction, no group difference was observed at any SNR in either condition. However, although nonsignificant, the greater within-group variance for the bilingual children in the normal-hearing condition indicated a wider \"normal\" range than for the monolingual children. Interestingly, although it did not contribute to the group difference, bilingual children's overall consonant recognition in both conditions improved with age, whereas such a developmental trend for monolingual children was observed only in the simulated hearing-loss condition, suggesting possible effects of experience. As for the recognition of individual consonants, the influence of background noise or simulated hearing loss was similar between groups and was consistent with the prediction based on their acoustic characteristics.\nThe results demonstrated that school-age, English-dominant, Spanish-English bilingual children can recognize English consonants in a background of speech-shaped noise with similar average accuracy as English-speaking monolingual age peers. The general impact of simulated hearing loss was also similar between bilingual and monolingual children. Thus, our hypothesis that bilingual children's English consonant recognition would suffer from background noise or simulated hearing loss more than the monolingual peers was rejected. However, the present results raise several issues that warrant further investigation, including the possible difference in the \"normal\" range for bilingual and monolingual children, influence of experience, impact of actual hearing loss on bilingual children, and stimulus quality.", "The relationship between trigonocephaly and cognitive problems might be explained by: secondary mechanical factors related to growth restriction of the skull, and primary structural defects caused by a shared mechanism related to brain developmental disorder(s) and skull malformation. However, because the exact pathophysiology remains unknown, we examined the pathophysiologic mechanisms behind cognitive dysfunction in patients with trigonocephaly, with an aim of providing a model for cognitive dysfunction based on routinely available variables.\nIncluded were 72 patients with trigonocephaly who were operated on. Postoperatively, intelligence was assessed prospectively. The two independent variables, secondary mechanical and primary brain developmental mechanisms, were evaluated retrospectively. Computed tomographic imaging was used to assess skull volume and severity of the frontal stenosis (secondary mechanical factors), width of the central part of the lateral ventricles, and other structural brain anomalies (primary brain developmental factors). Extracranial congenital anomalies were also taken into account.\nNo association was found between secondary mechanical factors and postoperative IQ score. Width of the central part of the lateral ventricles, and an interaction effect between this width and additional extracranial anomalies, showed a significant negative association with postoperative IQ.\nPrimary brain developmental disorders seem to play an important role in the development of cognitive problems in trigonocephaly. Assessment of width of the central part of the lateral ventricle scores and additional extracranial congenital anomalies for the early prediction of cognitive problems in patients with trigonocephaly could be clinically valuable and can be performed using routinely available tools.", "The competition between the chess computer Deep Blue and the former chess world champion Garri Kasparov in 1997 was a\u00a0spectacle staged for the media. However, the chess game, like other games, was also a\u00a0test field for artificial intelligence research. On the one hand Deep Blue's victory was called a\u00a0\"milestone\" for AI research, on the other hand, a\u00a0dead end, since the superiority of the chess computer was based on pure computing power and had nothing to do with \"real\" AI.The article questions the premises of these different interpretations and maps Deep Blue and its way of playing chess into the history of AI. This also requires an analysis of the underlying concepts of thinking. Finally, the essay calls for assuming different \"ways of thinking\" for man and computer. Instead of fundamental discussions of concepts of thinking, we should ask about the consequences of the human-machine division of labor.", "Mental disorders (MDs) such as intellectual disability (ID), autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and schizophrenia have a strong genetic component. Recently, many gene mutations associated with ID, ASD or schizophrenia have been identified by high-throughput sequencing. A substantial fraction of these mutations are in genes encoding transcriptional regulators. Transcriptional regulators associated with different MDs but acting in the same gene regulatory network provide information on the molecular relation between MDs. Physical interaction between transcriptional regulators is a strong predictor for their cooperation in gene regulation. Here, we biochemically purified transcriptional regulators from neural stem cells, identified their interaction partners by mass spectrometry and assembled a protein interaction network containing 206 proteins, including 68 proteins mutated in MD patients and 52 proteins significantly lacking coding variation in humans. Our network shows molecular connections between established MD proteins and provides a discovery tool for novel MD genes. Network proteins preferentially co-localize on the genome and cooperate in disease-relevant gene regulation. Our results suggest that the observed transcriptional regulators associated with ID, ASD or schizophrenia are part of a transcriptional network in neural stem cells. We find that more severe mutations in network proteins are associated with MDs that include lower intelligence quotient (IQ), suggesting that the level of disruption of a shared transcriptional network correlates with cognitive dysfunction.", "The coexistence of technology and caring is best exemplified in nursing. The theory of Technological Competency as Caring in Nursing illuminates this coexistence as the essence of technology in health care premised on machine technologies as a generic concept of objects or things that are mechanical, organic, and electronic. With its timely development these technologies are continually imbued with artificial general intelligence. As such, the ultimate expression of machine technologies in nursing turns out to be autonomous robots (ARs) with future potentials of functions comparable to human persons. While theory-based nursing practice is essential to nursing care practice, quality human care, particularly with technologies assuming indispensable practice process mechanisms is critical. Some practice-based questions informing ARs and human person engagements in nursing care practice include, \"Will ARs which are imbued with artificial intelligence replace nurses in their practice?\" \"What contributions to quality human health care will autonomous and artificially intelligent robots provide?\" While these questions may reflect far-reaching ramifications of technologies in health care, it must also be acknowledged that these technologies are fundamental to the delivery of quality human health care now, and in the future.

However, they scored above the group norms on the MSCEIT-YRV subscale of Managing Emotions and lower on Understanding Emotions. On the EQi:YV-Brief, children with ADHD reported significantly lower Interpersonal and Adaptability EI.\nChildren with ADHD are relatively similar to children without ADHD when examining EI scores. However, there is some variability in the EI measures which should be considered when creating intervention programs.", "The effect of benzodiazepine long-term administration (BLTA) in cognitive functioning of subjects with schizophrenia (SZ) has been partially explored to date. The objective was to assess BLTA-associated cognitive impairment with a comprehensive cognitive battery in a non-selected multicentric/national community-dwelling sample of stabilized SZ subjects.\n407 community-dwelling stabilized SZ subjects were consecutively included in the FondaMental Academic Centers of Expertise for Schizophrenia Cohort (FACE-SZ). Patients taking daily benzodiazepine were defined as BLTA+ as all patients examined by the Expert Center were clinically stabilized and under stable dose of treatment for at least 3\u00a0months. Each patient has been administered a 1-day long comprehensive cognitive battery (including The National Adult Reading Test, the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, the Trail Making Test, the California Verbal Learning Test, the Doors test, and The Continuous Performance Test-Identical Pairs).\nIn the multivariate analyses, results showed that BLTA was associated with impaired attention/working memory (OR 0.60, 95% confidence interval 0.42-0.86; p\u00a0=\u00a00.005) independently of socio-demographic variables and illness characteristics. Verbal and performance current IQ-[respectively, OR 0.98, 95% CI (0.96;0.99), p\u00a0=\u00a00.016 and 0.98, 95% CI(0.97;0.99), p\u00a0=\u00a00.034] but not premorbid IQ-(p\u00a0>\u00a00.05) have been associated with BLTA in a multivariate model including the same confounding variables.\nBLTA is associated with impaired attention/working memory in schizophrenia. The BLTA benefit/risk ratio should be regularly reevaluated. Alternative pharmacological and non-pharmacological strategies for comorbid anxiety disorders and sleep disorders should be preferred when possible. It seems reasonable to withdraw BLTA before the start of cognitive remediation therapy, as soon as possible, to improve the effectiveness of this therapy. Limits: the delay between the last benzodiazepine intake and testing, as well as the specific class of benzodiazepines (long half-life vs. short half-life), and the number of benzodiazepine daily intakes have not been recorded in the present study. The precise motive for BLTA prescription and sleep disturbances have not been reported, which is a limit for the interpretation of the present results.", "This prospective study describes disease/treatment, personal characteristics, and social/family contextual variables as risk and resilience factors that predict social competence in pediatric brain tumor survivors (PBTS).\nNinety-one PBTS (51% male, mean age 11.21\u00a0years, off-treatment, attending a regular classroom >50% of the time) participated. PBTS and their primary caregivers (proxy) completed the Social Skills Rating System (SSRS) to assess social competence at baseline, 2, and 8\u00a0months follow-up. At baseline, medical information (e.g., tumor type and location, cranial irradiation therapy (CIT)), personal characteristics (e.g., child's age and gender, intelligence, executive function, attention, and memory), and social/family factors (family income and ethnicity) were obtained.\nUsing mixed model multivariable analyses with a longitudinal component, tumor type (medulloblastoma) (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) and poor executive function, specifically, emotional control, were the best predictors of low total and assertion self-reported SSRS scores (p\u00a0<\u00a00.02). Receiving CIT was associated with low proxy-reported assertion (p\u00a0=\u00a00.035), and cooperation score (p\u00a0=\u00a00.02). Poor emotional control was associated with low proxy-reported total (p\u00a0=\u00a00.032), assertion (p\u00a0=\u00a00.023), and self-control scores (p\u00a0=\u00a00.007). Being non-White was associated with low proxy-reported total (p\u00a0=\u00a00.016), self-control (p\u00a0=\u00a00.040), responsibility (p\u00a0=\u00a00.035), and cooperation scores (p\u00a0=\u00a00.002). There were no significant changes over time.\nThis study supports a multifactorial model of insult and non-insult factors (medical, personal, and social context) as determinants of social competence in PBTS. Data from both informants identify determinants of social competence. These factors need to be considered in future interventions to help children better improve their social competence.", "OBJECTIVE Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is treated with either surgical clipping or endovascular coiling, though the latter is the preferred treatment method given its more favorable functional outcomes. However, neuropsychological functioning after treatment is rarely taken into account. In this meta-analysis, the authors synthesized relevant data from the literature and compared neuropsychological functioning in patients after coiling and clipping of SAH. They hypothesized that the coiled patients would outperform the clipped patients; that group differences would be greater with higher posterior circulation rupture rates, in older patients, and in more recent publications; that group differences would be smaller with greater rates of middle cerebral artery (MCA) rupture; and that anterior communicating artery (ACoA) rupture rates would not influence effect sizes. METHODS The MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO databases were searched for clinical studies that compared neuropsychological functioning after either endovascular coiling or surgical clipping for SAH. Hedge's g and 95% confidence intervals were calculated using random effects models. Patients who had undergone coiling or clipping were compared on test performance in 8 neuropsychological domains: executive functions, language, attention/processing speed, verbal memory, visual memory, spatial memory, visuospatial functions, and intelligence. Patients were also compared with healthy controls, and meta-regressions were used to explore the relation between effect sizes and publication year, delay between treatment and neuropsychological testing, mean patient age, and rates of posterior circulation, ACoA, and MCA ruptures. RESULTS Thirteen studies with 396 clipped cases, 314 coiled cases, and 169 healthy controls were included in the study. The coil-treated patients outperformed the clip-treated patients on executive function (g = 0.17, 95% CI 0.08-0.25) and language tests (g = 0.23, 95% CI 0.07-0.39), and all patients were impaired relative to healthy controls (g ranged from -0.93 to -0.29). Coiled patients outperformed clipped patients to a greater degree in more recent publications, over longer posttreatment testing delays, and among older patients. Higher rates of posterior circulation and MCA aneurysms were associated with smaller group differences, while ACoA rupture rates did not influence effect sizes. CONCLUSIONS Coiling of SAH may promote superior neuropsychological functioning under certain circumstances and could have applications for the specialized care of SAH patients.", "Neuroticism is a risk factor for selected mental and physical illnesses and is inversely associated with intelligence. Intelligence appears to interact with neuroticism and mitigate its detrimental effects on physical health and mortality. However, the inter-relationships of neuroticism and intelligence for major depressive disorder (MDD) and psychological distress has not been well examined.\nAssociations and interactions between neuroticism and general intelligence (g) on MDD, self-reported depression, and psychological distress were examined in two population-based cohorts: Generation Scotland: Scottish Family Health Study (GS:SFHS, n=19,200) and UK Biobank (n=90,529). The Eysenck Personality Scale Short Form-Revised measured neuroticism and g was extracted from multiple cognitive ability tests in each cohort. Family structure was adjusted for in GS:SFHS.\nNeuroticism was strongly associated with increased risk for depression and higher psychological distress in both samples. Although intelligence conferred no consistent independent effects on depression, it did increase the risk for depression across samples once neuroticism was adjusted for. Results suggest that higher intelligence may ameliorate the association between neuroticism and self-reported depression although no significant interaction was found for clinical MDD. Intelligence was inversely associated with psychological distress across cohorts. A small interaction was found across samples such that lower psychological distress associates with higher intelligence and lower neuroticism, although effect sizes were small.\nFrom two large cohort studies, our findings suggest intelligence acts a protective factor in mitigating the effects of neuroticism on psychological distress. Intelligence does not confer protection against diagnosis of depression in those high in neuroticism.", "Software Defined Networking (SDN) is an emerging promising paradigm for network management because of its centralized network intelligence. However, the centralized control architecture of the software-defined networks (SDNs) brings novel challenges of reliability, scalability, fault tolerance and interoperability. In this paper, we proposed a novel clustered distributed controller architecture in the real setting of SDNs. The distributed cluster implementation comprises of multiple popular SDN controllers. The proposed mechanism is evaluated using a real world network topology running on top of an emulated SDN environment. The result shows that the proposed distributed controller clustering mechanism is able to significantly reduce the average latency from 8.1% to 1.6%, the packet loss from 5.22% to 4.15%, compared to distributed controller without clustering running on HP Virtual Application Network (VAN) SDN and Open Network Operating System (ONOS) controllers respectively. Moreover, proposed method also shows reasonable CPU utilization results. Furthermore, the proposed mechanism makes possible to handle unexpected load fluctuations while maintaining a continuous network operation, even when there is a controller failure. The paper is a potential contribution stepping towards addressing the issues of reliability, scalability, fault tolerance, and inter-operability.", "The authors investigated whether children with Down's syndrome (DS) who have not started to produce number words understand the one-to-one correspondence principle (Experiment 1), and they looked at the relationship between number word knowledge and receptive vocabulary (Experiment 2).\nSixteen children with DS who did not recite the count list participated in Experiment 1, along with 2 comparison groups: 1 of 16 children with DS who recited up to 10, paired by chronological age, and another of 16 typically developing children paired by their ability to recite the list. The understanding of the principle was evaluated by a preferential looking task. Children saw 1 of 2 conditions. In the number condition, they heard number words and in the beep condition they heard computerized beeps. In both conditions, children saw videos depicting counting events that were principle-consistent or principle-inconsistent. Experiment 2 evaluated 25 children with DS using the Give-a-Number task and the Receptive Vocabulary subtest of the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence-III.\nIn Experiment 1, children in the number condition preferred principle-consistent videos, independent of their ability to recite the count list. Experiment 2 showed a strong correlation between number word knowledge and receptive vocabulary scores, independent of chronological age.\nThe results suggest that the difficulty of children with DS in acquiring counting ability might not reflect a lack of understanding of the one-to-one correspondence principle, but might instead be related to vocabulary development. (PsycINFO Database Record", "The ability of health-care providers to demonstrate empathy toward their patients results in a number of positive outcomes improving the quality of care. In addition, a provider's level of emotional intelligence (EI) can further the doctor-patient relationship, stimulating a more personalized and comprehensive manner of treating patients. Furthermore, personality traits of a clinician may positively or negatively influence that relationship, as well as clinical outcomes. This study was designed to evaluate empathy levels in podiatric medical students in a 4-year doctoral program. Moreover, this study aimed to determine whether EI, personality traits, and demographic variables exhibit correlations with the observed empathy patterns.\nThis cross-sectional study collected data using an anonymous web-based survey completed by 150 students registered at the New York College of Podiatric Medicine. There were four survey sections: (1) demographics, (2) empathy (measured by the Jefferson Scale of Physicians' Empathy), (3) EI (measured by the Assessing Emotions Scale), and (4) personality traits (measured by the NEO-Five-Factor Inventory-3).\nEmpathy levels were significantly correlated with EI scores (r = 0.62, n = 150, P< 0.0001). All the five domains of personality were also shown to correlate with empathy scores, as well as with EI scores. With respect to demographics, Asian-American students had lower mean empathy scores than students of other races (P = 0.0018), females had higher mean empathy scores compared to men (P = 0.001), and undergraduate grade point average correlated with empathy scores in a nonmonotonic fashion (P = 0.0269).\nWhen measuring the variables, it was evident that there was a strong correlation between empathy, EI, and personality in podiatric medical students. Given the suggested importance and effect of such qualities on patient care, these findings may serve as guidance for possible amendments and warranted curriculum initiatives in medical education.", "This study developed a battery of computerized working memory (WM) tests and a scoring system suitable for young adult users. The tests comprised five classic tasks derived from Baddeley's model of WM, reflecting each of the five WM functions. We recruited 115 undergraduate and graduate students from various academic fields and constructed a preliminary WM scoring norm for young adults. The scoring norm was used as a basis for developing a computerized assessment system. The results of correlation analysis show that the fluid intelligence of young adults is related to the memory function of WM, but not to the central executive system. The proposed working memory test battery for young adults comprehensively reflects the WM capacity of adults.", "GDAP1-related hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy (GDAP1-HMSN) is a peripheral neuropathy (also known as a subtype of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease) that typically affects the lower extremities earlier and more severely than the upper extremities. As the neuropathy progresses, the distal upper extremities also become severely affected. Proximal muscles can also become weak. Age at onset ranges from infancy to early childhood. In most cases, disease progression causes disabilities within the first or second decade of life. At the end of the second decade, most individuals are wheelchair bound. Disease progression varies considerably even within the same family. The neuropathy can be either of the demyelinating type with reduced nerve conduction velocities or the axonal type with normal nerve conduction velocities. Vocal cord paresis is common. Intelligence is normal. Life expectancy is usually normal, but on occasion may be reduced because of secondary complications.\nDiagnosis of GDAP1-HMSN is based on clinical findings and confirmed by detection on molecular genetic testing of either biallelic pathogenic variants in GDAP1 in those with autosomal recessive inheritance or a heterozygous pathogenic variant in those with autosomal dominant inheritance.\nTreatment of manifestations: Treatment is symptomatic and involves evaluation and management by a multidisciplinary team that includes neurologists, physiatrists, orthopedic surgeons, and physical and occupational therapists. Treatment may include: daily heel cord stretching exercises to prevent Achilles tendon shortening, ankle/foot orthoses, orthopedic surgery, forearm crutches or canes, wheelchairs, treatment of musculoskeletal pain with acetaminophen or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, and career and employment counseling. Surveillance: Regular evaluation by the multidisciplinary team to determine neurologic status and functional disability. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Drugs and medications known to cause nerve damage; obesity.\nGDAP1-HMSN is usually inherited in an autosomal recessive (AR) manner; autosomal dominant (AD) inheritance is also observed. AR inheritance: At conception, each sib of an affected individual has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Carrier testing for at-risk relatives is possible once the pathogenic variants in an affected family member have been identified. AD inheritance: Offspring of an individual with AD GDAP1-HMSN have a 50% risk of inheriting the GDAP1 pathogenic variant from their affected parent. Prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk for GDAP1-HMSN and preimplantation genetic testing are possible for families in which the pathogenic variant(s) have been identified.", "Previous studies with bilingual children have shown that the nature of their second-language instruction has an effect on the development of their cognitive abilities. The aim of this study was to determine whether children who acquire a second language in two different immersion programs for a period of 1year show advantages in executive functions and to examine how the amount of daily exposure affects executive functions. A group of Serbian-speaking second-grade children exposed to the second language for about 5h each day (high exposure group, HEG) and a low-exposure group (LEG) exposed to the second language for about 1.5h each day were compared with an age-matched control group (CG) of monolingual peers on working memory, inhibition, and shifting. Significant group differences were found for working memory, with the HEG performing better than the CG and LEG even after controlling for individual differences in terms of age and intelligence. The three groups did not differ in terms of inhibition and overall shifting abilities, although the control group had a marginally significant advantage on one of the two shifting tasks. Our findings extend previous research by demonstrating that the amount of daily exposure is a significant factor affecting executive functions in early immersion programs for second-language acquisition. In addition, they show that early intensive second-language acquisition can be advantageous for performance on tasks that require a higher level of executive control.", "Evidence has shown neurocognitive problems often exist among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected children. There are limited data for children in Nigeria.\nThis was a cross-sectional study of 100 school-aged perinatally HIV-infected children seen in the paediatric HIV clinic and age/sex-matched controls from the general paediatric clinic. Neuro-cognitive functioning was assessed using the Raven's progressive matrices (RPM) that has been adapted for the Nigerian population.\nThe mean RPM score of subjects was 22.97\u2009\u00b1\u200911.35 compared with 32.93\u2009\u00b1\u200915.71 among controls (p < 0.001). Twenty-two percent of subjects in the HIV-infected group vs. 56% of controls were in the above-average intelligence group on the RPM. Thirty-four percent had average scores, while 22% were in the below-average scoring range. Neuro-cognitive functioning of the subjects was significantly affected by immunologic staging and socio-economic status.\nNeurocognitive functioning of the HIV-infected children was significantly lower than those of their un-infected counterparts. Neurodevelopmental evaluation should be part of standard care in HIV-infected children in Nigerian setting.", "[Purpose] Prevention of dementia requires early intervention against it. To ensure that early interventions are effective it is crucial to study the cognitive functions related to dementia in young adulthood. Moreover, it is needed not only to verify the cognitive function test but also to elucidate the actual brain activity and the influence of related factors on the brain activity. To investigate the factors influencing cognitive function among young adults and examine the differences in executive function by physical activity level. [Subjects and Methods] Forty healthy university students (mean age, 20.4\u2005years) were classified into two groups by cognitive function score (HIGH and LOW), determined according to Trail Making Test performance and Stroop task processing time. We then assessed what factors were related to cognitive function by logistic regression analysis. Executive function was determined by brain blood flow using near-infrared spectroscopy during the Stroop task, and was then compared by physical activity levels (determined according to number of steps per hour). [Results] Full-scale Intelligence Quotient according to the 3rd Wechsler Adult Intelligent Scale and number of steps per hour influenced cognitive function score, with odds ratios of 1.104 and 1.012, respectively. Oxy-hemoglobin concentrations in areas related to executive function during the Stroop task were significantly higher among those in the high physical activity group than among those in the low physical activity group. [Conclusion] The study revealed that Full-scale Intelligence Quotient and a number of steps per hour are factors associated with the cognitive functions in young adulthood. In addition, activity in execution function related area was found to be significantly higher in the high physical activity group than in the low physical activity group, suggesting the importance of physical activity for enhancing young adulthood cognitive functions.", "Internet access and usage has changed how people seek and report health information. Meanwhile,infectious diseases continue to threaten humanity. The analysis of Big Data, or vast digital data, presents an opportunity to improve disease surveillance and epidemic intelligence. Epidemic intelligence contains two components: indicator based and event-based. A relatively new surveillance type has emerged called event-based Internet biosurveillance systems. These systems use information on events impacting health from Internet sources, such as social media or news aggregates. These systems circumvent the limitations of traditional reporting systems by being inexpensive, transparent, and flexible. Yet, innovations and the functionality of these systems can change rapidly.\nTo update the current state of knowledge on event-based Internet biosurveillance systems by identifying all systems, including current functionality, with hopes to aid decision makers with whether to incorporate new methods into comprehensive programmes of surveillance.\nA systematic review was performed through PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases, while also including grey literature and other publication types.\n50 event-based Internet systems were identified, including an extraction of 15 attributes for each system, described in 99 articles. Each system uses different innovative technology and data sources to gather data, process, and disseminate data to detect infectious disease outbreaks.\nThe review emphasises the importance of using both formal and informal sources for timely and accurate infectious disease outbreak surveillance, cataloguing all event-based Internet biosurveillance systems. By doing so, future researchers will be able to use this review as a library for referencing systems, with hopes of learning, building, and expanding Internet-based surveillance systems. Event-based Internet biosurveillance should act as an extension of traditional systems, to be utilised as an additional, supplemental data source to have a more comprehensive estimate of disease burden.", "The constructs of intelligence and executive function (EF) are commonly used in neuropsychological, cognitive, and developmental research, and in the context of clinical assessment. Yet, we have a limited understanding of the changing age-related associations among these cognitive constructs and the implications for measurement and research. The objectives of this study were to compare hypothetical models using intellectual abilities (non-age corrected scores of intelligence or IQ) and experimental measures of EF and to better understand the role of age in determining the associations between these cognitive abilities at two different periods of development. We also incorporated prediction of ADHD-related difficulties.\nWe examined intellectual abilities and EF in a typically developing child sample (N\u00a0=\u00a0250) and young-adult sample (N\u00a0=\u00a0329). We used confirmatory factor analysis to estimate models for each developmental period: a one-factor model of general cognitive ability and a two-factor model of intelligence and EF. ADHD-related difficulties were regressed on the factors from each model.\nAge was more strongly related to all cognitive abilities in the child sample than in the young-adult sample. In the factor analytic models, higher amounts of cognitive test score variance were explained by both models in the child sample than in the young-adult sample. Further, in the child sample, the general cognitive ability factor (combining intellectual abilities and EF) was a significant predictor of ADHD-related difficulties, but the separate intellectual ability and EF factors were not.\nVariables highly associated with age (such as intellectual ability and EF) should not be statistically controlled when assessing cognitive constructs especially in child samples when there is rapid change in cognitive abilities.", "Large studies, with limited resources call for cost-effective cognitive assessment methods. Computerized tests offer viable alternatives but more data are needed on their functioning. Our aim was to evaluate the overlap between a computerized neuropsychological test battery and a traditional test of general intelligence (IQ).\nCognitive functioning was assessed in birth cohort mothers (n = 80) with two widely used methods: Cogstate, computerized test battery, and WAIS-IV, a traditional IQ test. Correlational analyses were conducted.\nWe found weak-to-moderate correlations between the measures, except for verbal comprehension. The indices of overall performance showed more consistent correlations than Subtests.\nThe overall correlations were in accordance with earlier studies. Cogstate is relatively independent of verbal comprehension abilities. The choice of the cognitive assessment method should be strongly guided by the research question. More studies are needed to evaluate the applicability of the Cogstate Composite Score in cognitive screening.", "To evaluate through a comprehensive protocol, the psychopathological profile of DMD boys. The primary aim of this observational study was to describe the emotional and behavioural profile and the neurodevelopmental problems of Italian boys with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD); the secondary aim was to explore the relation between psychopathological profile and DMD genotype.\n47 DMD boys, aged 2-18, were included in the study and assessed through structured and validated tools including Wechsler scales or Griffiths for cognitive ability, Child Behavior Check List (CBCL), Youth Self Report (YSR) and Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) for emotional and behavioural features. Patients \"at risk\" based on questionnaires scores were evaluated by a clinical structured interview using Development and Well Being Assessment (DAWBA) or Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS), as required.\nThe 47 enrolled patients, defined with a Full Scale Intelligence Quotient (FSIQ) of 80.38 (one SD below average), and presenting a large and significant difference in FSIQ in relation to the site of mutation along the dystrophin gene (distal mutations associated with a more severe cognitive deficit), were showing Internalizing Problems (23.4%) and Autism Spectrum Disorders (14.8%). Interestingly, an association of internalizing problems with distal deletion of the DMD gene is documented.\nEven though preliminary, these data show that the use of validated clinical instruments, that focus on the impact of emotional/behaviour problems on everyday life, allows to carefully identify clinically significant psychopathology.", "This review examines several recent books that deal with the impact of automation and robotics on the future of jobs. Most books in this genre predict that the current phase of digital technology will create massive job loss in an unprecedented way, that is, that this wave of automation is different from previous waves. Uniquely digital technology is said to automate professional occupations for the first time. This review critically examines these claims, puncturing some of the hyperbole about automation, robotics and Artificial Intelligence. The review argues for a more nuanced analysis of the politics of technology and provides some critical distance on Silicon Valley's futurist discourse. Only by insisting that futures are always social can public bodies, rather than autonomous markets and endogenous technologies, become central to disentangling, debating and delivering those futures.", "To assess the predictive value of the 36-month Ages & Stages Questionnaire (ASQ) score for IQ score at age 5 to 6 years in the general population and to identify factors associated with IQ <85 once the ASQ score is taken into account.\nData were collected from 939 children enrolled in a population-based prospective cohort study. Developmental outcomes at 36 months were assessed via the ASQ and at 5 to 6 years via the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence. The ASQ threshold was identified via the receiver operating characteristic curve. Additional predictive factors to obtain an IQ <85 were investigated, and their interaction with ASQ score was studied.\nSixty-nine children (7.3%) had an IQ <85. A 36-month ASQ score threshold of 270 was optimal to identify children with an IQ <85 at 5 to 6 years, with a 0.77 \u00b1 0.11 sensitivity and 0.68 \u00b1 0.03 specificity. Maternal educational level and occupational activity at the time of ASQ completion were associated with the risk of an IQ <85 at a given ASQ level. In the multivariate model, no interaction between the studied factors and ASQ score reached significance.\nIn the general pediatric population, 36-month ASQ parental reports could be used to identify children at later risk of cognitive delay. Low maternal education level should also be considered as a major risk factor for lower IQ in preschool children regardless of ASQ score.", "Critical thinking enables people to form sound beliefs and provides a basis for emotional life. Research has indicated that individuals with better critical thinking disposition can better recognize and regulate their emotions, though the neuroanatomical mechanisms involved in this process remain to be elucidated. Further, the influence of emotional intelligence on the relationship between brain structure and critical thinking disposition has not been examined. The present study utilized voxel-based morphometry (VBM) to investigate the neural structures underlying critical thinking disposition in a large sample of college students (N\u00a0=\u00a0296). Regional gray matter volume (rGMV) in the bilateral temporal pole, which reflects an individual's ability to process social and emotional information, was negatively correlated with critical thinking disposition. In addition, rGMV in bilateral para hippocampal regions -regions involved in contextual association/emotional regulation-exhibited negative correlation with critical thinking disposition. Further analysis revealed that emotional intelligence moderated the relationship between rGMV of the temporal pole and critical thinking disposition. Specifically, critical thinking disposition was associated with decreased GMV of the temporal pole for individuals who have relatively higher emotional intelligence rather than lower emotional intelligence. The results of the present study indicate that people who have higher emotional intelligence exhibit more effective and automatic processing of emotional information and tend to be strong critical thinkers.", "Inorganic arsenic at high and prolonged doses is highly neurotoxic. Few studies have evaluated whether long-term, low-level arsenic exposure is associated with neuropsychological functioning in adults.\nTo investigate the association between long-term, low-level inorganic arsenic exposure and neuropsychological functioning among American Indians aged 64-95.\nWe assessed 928 participants in the Strong Heart Study by using data on arsenic species in urine samples collected at baseline (1989-1991) and results of standardized tests of global cognition, executive functioning, verbal learning and memory, fine motor functioning, and speed of mental processing administered during comprehensive follow-up evaluations in 2009-2013. We calculated the difference in neuropsychological functioning for a 10% increase in urinary arsenic with adjustment for sex, age, education, and study site.\nThe sum of inorganic and methylated arsenic species (\u2211As) in urine was associated with limited fine motor functioning and processing speed. A 10% increase in \u2211As was associated with a .10 (95% CI -.20, -.01) decrease on the Finger Tapping Test for the dominant hand and a .13 decrease (95% CI -.21, -.04) for the non-dominant hand. Similarly, a 10% increase in \u2211As was associated with a .15 (95% CI -.29, .00) decrease on the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Fourth Edition Coding Subtest. \u2211As was not associated with other neuropsychological functions.\nFindings indicate an adverse association between increased urinary arsenic fine motor functioning and processing speed, but not with other neuropsychological functioning, among elderly American Indians.", "Psychotic disorders and intelligence deficiencies are no longer contraindications for cochlear implantation regarding the revised German guidelines from May 2012. This article aims to evaluate the outcome of patients with severe psychiatric comorbidities. Therefore the database of the Cochlear Implant Center of the University Hospital of Heidelberg was investigated.\nRetrospective case review.\nWe present three patients who received a cochlear implant (CI) despite a serious psychiatric disorder. Two were sent from psychiatrists asking if a CI was possible for their profound hearing loss. One patient had acoustic hallucinations and a recurrent depressive disorder, the other had a schizophrenic psychosis and a minor impairment of intelligence. The third patient had a recurrent depressive disorder, a posttraumatic stress disorder, a chronic pain disorder, and paranoid personality traits. We discuss the preoperative diagnosis, course of diseases, and psychosocial situation.\nAll three patients received a CI and rehabilitation in the Cochlear Implant Center of the University Hospital of Heidelberg. All three of them opted for a second implant and developed a good hearing outcome. Free field understanding of words in quite is for all three of them over 60% in the Freiburger monosyllable test with two implants, similar to nonpsychiatric patients' results. No patient has acceptance problems. In the long run, no aggravation of the psychiatric diseases occurred.\nWith interdisciplinary evaluation, a cochlear implantation is possible in severely impaired psychiatric patients. For a good result the indication is to be discussed interdisciplinary.", "The complex non-linear behavior presented in the biological treatment of wastewater requires an accurate model to predict the system performance. This study evaluates the effectiveness of an artificial intelligence (AI) model, based on the combination of artificial neural networks (ANNs) and genetic algorithms (GAs), to find the optimum performance of an up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor (UASB) for saline wastewater treatment. Chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal was predicted using conductivity, organic loading rate (OLR) and temperature as input variables. The ANN model was built from experimental data and performance was assessed through the maximum mean absolute percentage error (= 9.226%) computed from the measured and model predicted values of the COD. Accordingly, the ANN model was used as a fitness function in a GA to find the best operational condition. In the worst case scenario (low energy requirements, high OLR usage and high salinity) this model guaranteed COD removal efficiency values above 70%. This result is consistent and was validated experimentally, confirming that this ANN-GA model can be used as a tool to achieve the best performance of a UASB reactor with the minimum requirement of energy for saline wastewater treatment.", "According to the technical intelligence hypothesis, humans are superior to all other animal species in understanding and using tools. However, the vast majority of comparative studies between humans and chimpanzees, both proficient tool users, have not controlled for the effects of age, prior knowledge, past experience, rearing conditions, or differences in experimental procedures. We tested whether humans are superior to chimpanzees in selecting better tools, using them more dexteriously, achieving higher performance and gaining access to more resource as predicted under the technical intelligence hypothesis.\nAka and Mbendjele hunter-gatherers in the rainforest of Central African Republic and the Republic of Congo, respectively, and Ta\u00ef chimpanzees in the rainforest of C\u00f4te d'Ivoire were observed cracking hard Panda oleosa nuts with different tools, as well as the soft Coula edulis and Elaeis guinensis nuts. The nut-cracking techniques, hammer material selection and two efficiency measures were compared.\nAs predicted, the Aka and the Mbendjele were able to exploit more species of hard nuts in the forest than chimpanzees. However, the chimpanzees were sometimes more efficient than the humans. Social roles differed between the two species, with the Aka and especially the Mbendjele exhibiting cooperation between nut-crackers whereas the chimpanzees were mainly individualistic.\nObservations of nut-cracking by humans and chimpanzees only partially supported the technical intelligence hypothesis as higher degrees of flexibility in tool selection seen in chimpanzees compensated for use of less efficient tool material than in humans. Nut cracking was a stronger social undertaking in humans than in chimpanzees.", "In this study, we report our experiences on the role of transplantation in 2 patients with large liver tumors in the setting of Abernethy malformation. Patient 1 was a 17-year-old boy who was referred for hepatic masses and recurrent hepatic encephalopathy episodes. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging showed 2 large tumors (4 and 8 cm) in the liver. The portal vein drained directly into the vena cava. Core biopsy of the larger mass revealed fibrosis and regenerative hyperplasia. There were hyperintense signals in the T1-weighted images in the globus pallidus. The Stanford-Binet intelligence scale showed moderate mental retardation (IQ 39); however, the patient showed good ability for caring for himself. His cognitive defect was ascribed partially to chronic encephalopathy. The patient received a right hepatic lobe from his older brother. The congenital portacaval shunt was disconnected to provide inflow to the graft. Pathologic examination of the explanted liver revealed no evidence of malignancy. His IQ improved to 75 at 29 months posttransplant. The hyperintensity of the globus pallidus on magnetic resonance imaging disappeared. The patient has maintained a normal life during 9 years of follow-up. Patient 2 was a 17-year-old girl who was referred for multiple hepatic masses; she had no symptoms at admission. Magnetic resonance imaging showed type 1 Abernethy malformation and multiple hepatic masses (largest was 10 cm), which appeared to be hyperplastic lesions. Because malignancy could not be definitely excluded, she received a right lobe without the middle hepatic vein from her uncle. Pathologic examination of the explanted liver showed localized nodular hyperplasia; there was no evidence of malignancy. She has maintained normal life activities during 3 years of follow-up. Liver transplant is a curative treatment option for patients with large liver tumors, replacing the hepatic parenchyma in the setting of Abernethy malformation.", "The Ages and Stages questionnaires (ASQ) has been recently validated in our country for developmental screening. The objective of this study is evaluate the validity of ASQ to predict low cognitive performance in the early years of schooling.\nDiagnostic test studies conducted on a sample of children of medium-high socioeconomic level were evaluated using ASQ at least once at 8, 18 and/or 30 months old, and later, between 6 and 9 years old, reevaluated using the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-third edition (WISC-III). Each ASQ evaluation was recorded independently. WISC-III was standardized, considering underperformance when the total score were under -1 standard deviation.\n123 children, corresponding to 174 ASQ assessments (42 of them were 8 months old, 55 were 18 months and 77 were 30 months of age) were included. An area under the ROC curve of 80.7% was obtained, showing higher values at 8 months (98.0%) compared to 18 and 30 months old (78.1 and 79.3%, respectively). Considering different ASQ scoring criteria, a low sensitivity (27.8 to 50.0%), but a high specificity (78.8 to 96.2%) were obtained; the positive predictive value ranged between 21 and 46%, while the negative value was 92.0-93.2%. Conclusion ASQ has low sensitivity but excellent specificity to predict a low cognitive performance during the first years of schooling, being a good alternative to monitor psychomotor development in children who attend the private sector healthcare in our country.", "The evolution of high performance computing technologies has enabled the large-scale implementation of neuromorphic models and pushed the research in computational intelligence into a new era. Among the machine learning applications, unsupervised detection of anomalous streams is especially challenging due to the requirements of detection accuracy and real-time performance. Designing a computing framework that harnesses the growing computing power of the multicore systems while maintaining high sensitivity and specificity to the anomalies is an urgent research topic. In this paper, we propose anomaly recognition and detection (AnRAD), a bioinspired detection framework that performs probabilistic inferences. We analyze the feature dependency and develop a self-structuring method that learns an efficient confabulation network using unlabeled data. This network is capable of fast incremental learning, which continuously refines the knowledge base using streaming data. Compared with several existing anomaly detection approaches, our method provides competitive detection quality. Furthermore, we exploit the massive parallel structure of the AnRAD framework. Our implementations of the detection algorithm on the graphic processing unit and the Xeon Phi coprocessor both obtain substantial speedups over the sequential implementation on general-purpose microprocessor. The framework provides real-time service to concurrent data streams within diversified knowledge contexts, and can be applied to large problems with multiple local patterns. Experimental results demonstrate high computing performance and memory efficiency. For vehicle behavior detection, the framework is able to monitor up to 16000 vehicles (data streams) and their interactions in real time with a single commodity coprocessor, and uses less than 0.2 ms for one testing subject. Finally, the detection network is ported to our spiking neural network simulator to show the potential of adapting to the emerging neuromorphic architectures.", "Currently, carnivores, and felids in particular, are vastly underrepresented in cognitive literature, despite being an ideal model system for tests of social and ecological intelligence hypotheses. Within Felidae, big cats (Panthera) are uniquely suited to studies investigating the evolutionary links between social, ecological, and cognitive complexity. Intelligence likely did not evolve in a unitary way but instead evolved as the result of mutually reinforcing feedback loops within the physical and social environments. The domain-specific social intelligence hypothesis proposes that social complexity drives only the evolution of cognitive abilities adapted only to social domains. The domain-general hypothesis proposes that the unique demands of social life serve as a bootstrap for the evolution of superior general cognition. Big cats are one of the few systems in which we can directly address conflicting predictions of the domain-general and domain-specific hypothesis by comparing cognition among closely related species that face roughly equivalent ecological complexity but vary considerably in social complexity.", "To examine predictors of speech disorder resolution versus persistence at age 7 years in children with speech errors at age 4 years.\nParticipants were drawn from a longitudinal, community cohort. Assessment at age 4 years (N?=?1494) identified children with speech errors. Reassessment at age 7 years allowed categorization into resolved or persistent categories. Logistic regression examined predictors of speech outcome, including family history, sex, socioeconomic status, nonverbal intelligence, and speech error type (delay vs disorder).\nAt age 7 years, persistent errors were seen in over 40% of children who had errors at age 4 years. Speech symptomatology was the only significant predictor of outcome (P?=?.02). Children with disordered errors at age 4 years were twice as likely to have poor speech outcomes at age 7 years compared with those with delayed errors.\nChildren with speech delay at age 4 years seem more likely to resolve, and this might justify a \"watch and wait\" approach. In contrast, those with speech disorder at age 4 years appear to be at greater risk for persistent difficulties, and could be prioritized for therapy to offset long-term impacts.", "Endometriosis intestines due to its non-specific symptoms can pose diagnostic problems, a lack of or incorrect treatment worsens the quality of life, sometimes leading to serious complications. The differential diagnosis of abdominal pain, especially in patients of reproductive age should be taken disease into account. Often abdominal pain in young women are classified as a functional gastrointestinal disorder, and only carefully collected intelligence allows you to focus on the diagnosis of endometriosis, especially if the symptoms significantly impair quality of life.\nA woman 32 year old who was admitted to the department of gastroenterology because of increasing pain in the abdomen. Due to the deteriorating condition of the patient, the characteristics of mechanical obstruction on imaging studies was transferred to the surgical ward with suspected Crohn's disease. She was treated surgically. Histopathological examination found endometriosis.\nEndometriosis outside the sex system can lead to serious complications.", "In 2010, in an article in this journal, I argued that declassified documents implicated Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) physicians in the conduct of unethical research on enhanced interrogation using detainee subjects. The focus, then as now, is upon physicians at the Office of Medical Services (OMS). The 2010 article highlighted the heavily redacted \"Draft OMS Guidelines on Medical and Psychological Support to Detainee Interrogations\" (the Draft). This commentary focuses upon the recently declassified final version of that document revealing further culpable evidence of unethical human subject research. The commentary locates that unethical research in historical context and the development of the Nuremberg Code. The commentary also locates enhanced interrogation in contemporary political context and considers how to hold OMS physicians accountable for the conduct of unethical human research using detainee subjects.", "Many individual- and job-related factors are known to influence medical careers decision making. Previous research has extensively studied medical trainees' (residents') and students' views of the factors that are important. However, how trainees and students trade off these factors at times of important careers-related decision making is under-researched. Information about trade-offs is crucial to the development of effective policies to enhance the recruitment and retention of junior doctors.\nOur aim was to investigate the strength of UK medical students' preferences for the characteristics of training posts in terms of monetary value.\nWe distributed a paper questionnaire that included a discrete choice experiment (DCE) to final-year medical students in six diverse medical schools across the UK. The main outcome measure was the monetary value of training post characteristics, based on willingness to forgo and willingness to accept extra income for a change in each job characteristic calculated from regression coefficients.\nA total of 810 medical students answered the questionnaire. The presence of good working conditions was by far the most influential characteristic of a training position. Medical students consider that, as newly graduated doctors, they will require compensation of an additional 43.68% above average earnings to move from a post with excellent working conditions to one with poor working conditions. Female students value excellent working conditions more highly than male students, whereas older medical students value them less highly than younger students.\nStudents on the point of completing medical school and starting postgraduate training value good working conditions significantly more than they value desirable geographical location, unit reputation, familiarity with the unit or opportunities for partners or spouses. This intelligence can be used to address the crisis in workforce staffing that has developed in the UK and opens up fruitful areas for future research across contexts and in terms of examining stated preferences versus actual career-related behaviour.", "OBJECTIVE Anterior capsulotomy (AC) is sometimes used as a last resort for treatment-refractory obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Previous studies assessing neuropsychological outcomes in patients with OCD have identified several forms of cognitive dysfunction that are associated with the disease, but few have focused on changes in cognitive function in OCD patients who have undergone surgery. In the present study, the authors investigated the effects of AC on the cognitive function of patients with treatment-refractory OCD. METHODS The authors selected 14 patients with treatment-refractory OCD who had undergone bilateral AC between 2007 and 2013, 14 nonsurgically treated OCD patients, and 14 healthy control subjects for this study. The 3 groups were matched for sex, age, and education. Several neuropsychological tests, including Similarities and Block Design, which are subsets of the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence; Immediate and Delayed Logical Memory and Immediate and Delayed Visual Reproduction, which are subsets of the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised; and Corrects, Categories, Perseverative Errors, Nonperseverative Errors, and Errors, subtests of the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, were conducted in all 42 subjects at baseline and after AC, after nonsurgical treatment, or at 6-month intervals, as appropriate. The Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) was used to measure OCD symptoms in all 28 OCD patients. RESULTS The Y-BOCS scores decreased significantly in both OCD groups during the 12-month follow-up period. Surgical patients showed higher levels of improvement in verbal memory, visual memory, visuospatial skills, and executive function than the nonsurgically treated OCD patients. CONCLUSIONS The findings of this study suggest that AC not only reduces OCD symptoms but also attenuates moderate cognitive deficits.", "To investigate the features of intelligence development, facial expression recognition ability, and the association between them in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).\nA total of 27 ASD children aged 6-16 years (ASD group, full intelligence quotient >70) and age- and gender-matched normally developed children (control group) were enrolled. Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children Fourth Edition and Chinese Static Facial Expression Photos were used for intelligence evaluation and facial expression recognition test.\nCompared with the control group, the ASD group had significantly lower scores of full intelligence quotient, verbal comprehension index, perceptual reasoning index (PRI), processing speed index\uff08PSI), and working memory index (WMI) (P<0.05). The ASD group also had a significantly lower overall accuracy rate of facial expression recognition and significantly lower accuracy rates of the recognition of happy, angry, sad, and frightened expressions than the control group (P<0.05). In the ASD group, the overall accuracy rate of facial expression recognition and the accuracy rates of the recognition of happy and frightened expressions were positively correlated with PRI (r=0.415, 0.455, and 0.393 respectively; P<0.05). The accuracy rate of the recognition of angry expression was positively correlated with WMI (r=0.397; P<0.05).\nASD children have delayed intelligence development compared with normally developed children and impaired expression recognition ability. Perceptual reasoning and working memory abilities are positively correlated with expression recognition ability, which suggests that insufficient perceptual reasoning and working memory abilities may be important factors affecting facial expression recognition ability in ASD children.\n\u63a2\u8ba8\u5b64\u72ec\u75c7\u8c31\u7cfb\u969c\u788d\uff08ASD\uff09\u513f\u7ae5\u7684\u667a\u529b\u53d1\u80b2\u7279\u70b9\u3001\u8868\u60c5\u8bc6\u522b\u80fd\u529b\u53ca\u4e24\u8005\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\n\u62db\u52df6~16\u5c81\u7684ASD\u513f\u7ae5\uff08ASD\u7ec4\uff0c\u603b\u667a\u5546\u5747\u5927\u4e8e70\uff09\u548c\u5e74\u9f84\u3001\u6027\u522b\u5339\u914d\u7684\u6b63\u5e38\u53d1\u80b2\u513f\u7ae5\uff08\u5bf9\u7167\u7ec4\uff09\u540427\u4f8b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u97e6\u6c0f\u513f\u7ae5\u667a\u529b\u91cf\u8868\uff08\u7b2c\u56db\u7248\uff09\u548c\u4e2d\u56fd\u4eba\u7269\u9759\u6001\u9762\u90e8\u8868\u60c5\u56fe\u7247\u5bf9\u4e24\u7ec4\u513f\u7ae5\u8fdb\u884c\u667a\u529b\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u8868\u60c5\u8bc6\u522b\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002\nASD\u7ec4\u603b\u667a\u5546\u3001\u8a00\u8bed\u7406\u89e3\u3001\u77e5\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u52a0\u5de5\u901f\u5ea6\u4ee5\u53ca\u5de5\u4f5c\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6307\u6570\u5f97\u5206\u5747\u4f4e\u4e8e\u5bf9\u7167\u7ec4\uff08P < 0.05\uff09\u3002ASD\u7ec4\u513f\u7ae5\u7684\u8868\u60c5\u8bc6\u522b\u603b\u6b63\u786e\u7387\u53ca\u9ad8\u5174\u3001\u751f\u6c14\u3001\u4f24\u5fc3\u3001\u5bb3\u6015\u8868\u60c5\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u7387\u5747\u4f4e\u4e8e\u5bf9\u7167\u7ec4\u513f\u7ae5\uff08P < 0.05\uff09\u3002ASD\u7ec4\u8868\u60c5\u8bc6\u522b\u603b\u6b63\u786e\u7387\u3001\u9ad8\u5174\u53ca\u5bb3\u6015\u8868\u60c5\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u7387\u4e0e\u77e5\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u5448\u6b63\u76f8\u5173\uff08r\u5206\u522b\u4e3a0.415\u30010.455\u30010.393\uff0cP < 0.05\uff09\uff0c\u751f\u6c14\u8868\u60c5\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u7387\u4e0e\u5de5\u4f5c\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6307\u6570\u5448\u6b63\u76f8\u5173\uff08r=0.397\uff0cP < 0.05\uff09\u3002\nASD\u513f\u7ae5\u5728\u667a\u529b\u53d1\u80b2\u7684\u591a\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u843d\u540e\u4e8e\u6b63\u5e38\u513f\u7ae5\uff0c\u5176\u8868\u60c5\u8bc6\u522b\u80fd\u529b\u53d7\u635f\u3002\u60a3\u513f\u667a\u529b\u4e2d\u7684\u77e5\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u5de5\u4f5c\u8bb0\u5fc6\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u8868\u60c5\u8bc6\u522b\u80fd\u529b\u5b58\u5728\u6b63\u76f8\u5173\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u63a8\u6d4b\u77e5\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u5de5\u4f5c\u8bb0\u5fc6\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u5f71\u54cdASD\u513f\u7ae5\u8868\u60c5\u8ba4\u77e5\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "The determinants of cognitive deficits among individuals with Klinefelter syndrome (KS) are not well understood. This study was conducted to assess the impact of general intelligence, personality, and social engagement on cognitive performance among patients with KS and a group of controls matched for age and years of education.\nSixty-nine patients with KS and 69 controls were assessed in terms of IQ, NEO personality inventory, the Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ) scale, and measures of cognitive performance reflecting working memory and executive function.\nPatients with KS performed more poorly on memory and executive-function tasks. Patients with KS also exhibited greater neuroticism and less extraversion, openness, and conscientiousness than controls. Memory deficits among patients with KS were associated with lower intelligence, while diminished executive functioning was mediated by both lower intelligence and less social engagement.\nOur results suggest that among patients with KS, memory deficits are principally a function of lower general intelligence, while executive-function deficits are associated with both lower intelligence and poorer social skills. This suggests a potential influence of social engagement on executive cognitive functioning (and/or vice-versa) among individuals with KS, and perhaps those with other genetic disorders. Future longitudinal research would be important to further clarify this and other issues discussed in this research.", "Recently, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been used widely in medicine and health care sector. In machine learning, the classification or prediction is a major field of AI. Today, the study of existing predictive models based on machine learning methods is extremely active. Doctors need accurate predictions for the outcomes of their patients' diseases. In addition, for accurate predictions, timing is another significant factor that influences treatment decisions. In this paper, existing predictive models in medicine and health care have critically reviewed. Furthermore, the most famous machine learning methods have explained, and the confusion between a statistical approach and machine learning has clarified. A review of related literature reveals that the predictions of existing predictive models differ even when the same dataset is used. Therefore, existing predictive models are essential, and current methods must be improved.", "HIV-infected individuals are at increased risk of neurocognitive impairment compared to the general population. Studies suggest that, despite combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), HIV infection causes immune activation which results in neural damage; however, few data exist in HIV-infected youth.\nHIV-infected youth 8-26-years-old on cART with virological suppression were prospectively enrolled along with healthy controls. Neurocognitive performance was assessed by age-appropriate Wechsler Intelligence Scales. Soluble and cellular markers of T-lymphocyte and monocyte activation were measured by ELISA and flow cytometry, respectively.\n45 HIV-infected subjects and 21 controls were enrolled. Markers of T-cell and monocyte activation were higher in the HIV-infected subjects compared to controls, but proportions of inflammatory and patrolling monocytes were similar. Although there were no significant differences in neurocognitive scores between the HIV-infected and control groups, scores were low-average for four of five testing domains for the HIV-infected subjects and average for all five in the controls, and % of HIV-infected subjects with scores classified as 'low average' or below was higher than in the controls. Variables most associated with neurocognitive performance among HIV-infected subjects included activated CD4+ T-cells (% CD4+CD38+HLA-DR), monocyte activation (soluble CD14), HIV duration, age and sex.\nHIV-infected youth on cART with virological suppression show subtle evidence of neurocognitive impairment compared to healthy controls, and increased immune activation appears to play a role. Additional studies are needed to develop strategic interventions beyond cART to potentially improve neurocognitive performance and/or minimize further impairment in this vulnerable population. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01523496.", "The last 2 decades witnessed a surge in empirical studies on the variables associated with achievement in higher education. A number of meta-analyses synthesized these findings. In our systematic literature review, we included 38 meta-analyses investigating 105 correlates of achievement, based on 3,330 effect sizes from almost 2 million students. We provide a list of the 105 variables, ordered by the effect size, and summary statistics for central research topics. The results highlight the close relation between social interaction in courses and achievement. Achievement is also strongly associated with the stimulation of meaningful learning by presenting information in a clear way, relating it to the students, and using conceptually demanding learning tasks. Instruction and communication technology has comparably weak effect sizes, which did not increase over time. Strong moderator effects are found for almost all instructional methods, indicating that how a method is implemented in detail strongly affects achievement. Teachers with high-achieving students invest time and effort in designing the microstructure of their courses, establish clear learning goals, and employ feedback practices. This emphasizes the importance of teacher training in higher education. Students with high achievement are characterized by high self-efficacy, high prior achievement and intelligence, conscientiousness, and the goal-directed use of learning strategies. Barring the paucity of controlled experiments and the lack of meta-analyses on recent educational innovations, the variables associated with achievement in higher education are generally well investigated and well understood. By using these findings, teachers, university administrators, and policymakers can increase the effectivity of higher education. (PsycINFO Database Record", "The Paediatric Active Enhanced Disease Surveillance (PAEDS) network is a hospital-based active surveillance system employing prospective case ascertainment of selected uncommon vaccine preventable diseases and potential adverse events following immunisation (AEFI). PAEDS enhances other Australian surveillance systems by providing prospective detailed clinical and laboratory data for the same child.\nSpecialist surveillance nurses screen hospital admissions, emergency department records, laboratory and other data, to prospectively identify hospitalised children aged under 15 years in 5 paediatric tertiary referral hospitals in New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Western Australia and Queensland. Standardised protocols and case definitions are used across all sites. Conditions under surveillance include vaccine preventable diseases: acute flaccid paralysis, varicella, pandemic and seasonal influenza and pertussis, and potential AEFIs: febrile seizures and intussusception. PAEDS also conducts surveillance for acute childhood encephalitis.\nSince August 2007, PAEDS has recruited a total of 6,227 hospitalised cases in total, for all conditions. From January to December 2014, there were 1,220 cases recruited across all conditions. Key outcomes include: enhanced acute flaccid paralysis surveillance to reach World Health Organization targets; supporting varicella and influenza vaccination in children; confirmation of a known low risk of febrile seizures following the 1st dose of measles-mumps-rubella vaccine but no increased risk of febrile seizures after measles-mumps-rubella-varicella vaccine, and a slightly increased risk of developing intussusception 1-7 days after rotavirus vaccination in infants aged less than 3 months. Acute childhood encephalitis data facilitated rapid investigation and response to the enterovirus 71 outbreak in 2013-2014.\nPAEDS provides unique policy-relevant data. This is the first of planned PAEDS annual reports to Communicable Diseases Intelligence.", "In ERP studies of cognitive processes during attentional tasks, the cue signals containing information about the target can increase the amplitude of the parietal cue P3 in relation to the 'neutral' temporal cue, and reduce the subsequent target P3 when this information is valid, i.e. corresponds to the target's attributes. The present study compared the cue-to-target P3 ratios in neutral and visuospatial cueing, in order to estimate the contribution of valid visuospatial information from the cue to target stages of the task performance, in terms of cognitive load. The P3 characteristics were also correlated with the results of individuals' performance of the visuospatial tasks, in order to estimate the relationship of the observed ERP with spatial reasoning. In 20 typically developing boys, aged 10-13 years (11.3\u00b10.86), the intelligence quotient (I.Q.) was estimated by the Block Design and Vocabulary subtests from the WISC-III. The subjects performed the Attentional Network Test (ANT) accompanied by EEG recording. The cued two-choice task had three equiprobable cue conditions: No cue, with no information about the target; Neutral (temporal) cue, with an asterisk in the center of the visual field, predicting the target onset; and Spatial cues, with an asterisk in the upper or lower hemifield, predicting the onset and corresponding location of the target. The ERPs were estimated for the mid-frontal (Fz) and mid-parietal (Pz) scalp derivations. In the Pz, the Neutral cue P3 had a lower amplitude than the Spatial cue P3; whereas for the target ERPs, the P3 of the Neutral cue condition was larger than that of the Spatial cue condition. However, the sums of the magnitudes of the cue and target P3 were equal in the spatial and neutral cueing, probably indicating that in both cases the equivalent information processing load is included in either the cue or the target reaction, respectively. Meantime, in the Fz, the analog ERP components for both the cue and target stimuli did not depend on the cue condition. The results show that, in the parietal site, the spatial cue P3 reflects the processing of visuospatial information regarding the target position. This contributes to the subsequent \"decision-making\", thus reducing the information processing load on the target response, which is probably reflected in the lower P3. This finding is consistent with the positive correlation of parietal cue P3 with the individual's ability to perform spatial tasks as scored by the Block Design subtest.", "The ability to learn tasks in a sequential fashion is crucial to the development of artificial intelligence. Until now neural networks have not been capable of this and it has been widely thought that catastrophic forgetting is an inevitable feature of connectionist models. We show that it is possible to overcome this limitation and train networks that can maintain expertise on tasks that they have not experienced for a long time. Our approach remembers old tasks by selectively slowing down learning on the weights important for those tasks. We demonstrate our approach is scalable and effective by solving a set of classification tasks based on a hand-written digit dataset and by learning several Atari 2600 games sequentially.", "Developmental dyslexia is defined as an unexpected specific and persistent failure to acquire efficient reading skills despite conventional instruction, adequate intelligence and sociocultural opportunity. This article reports the outcomes of a study that evaluated the implementation of a 4-month intervention program. The intervention consisted of structured activities aiming at improving (a) the children's phonological awareness, (b) their visual and auditory memory, (c) their visual discrimination ability, and (d) their text comprehension. Participants were 12 children diagnosed as dyslexic matched with 12 typically achieving peers of similar age and gender. Baseline assessment consisted of a clinical neuropsychological battery of tests and Event Related Potentials (ERPs) and resulted in confirming the discrepancy between the dyslexic and the control group. Following the remediation program, the dyslexic group did not differ significantly from their control group in six out of eight neuropsychological tests. The electrophysiological results revealed that the two groups had similar P300 latencies in 12 out of the 15 electroencephalographic sites assessed. These findings suggest that children with dyslexia can improve their abilities through a remediation program which aims to strengthen their audio-visual and phonological processes along with their working memory capability.", "Coping Intelligence is defined as efficient individual ways of managing life stress. This paper presents a new assessment instrument named Coping IQ (CIQ; Coping Intelligence Questionnaire). A measure is based on the Multidimensional Positive Coping Model, which includes three cross-cutting parameters that characterize coping strategy as efficient or inefficient, emotional, cognitive or behavioral, and active or passive. Results of the factor analysis verified a basic two-factor structure of the Coping Intelligence with the alternative solutions for efficient and inefficient coping strategies characterized via three basic modalities. The validity of the Coping IQ instrument showed an internal consistency ranging from 0.72 to 0.81. The unified methodology that underlies the new concept of Coping Intelligence, as well as Coping IQ assessment, is applicable for studying both clinical and general populations. CIQ parameters might serve as useful feedback while assessing changes in individual coping repertoire, for CIQ measures strategies that can be modified as a result of life experiences or educational training. Based on the study findings, Coping Intelligence is further defined by a broad repertoire of life skills required to solve successfully everyday stress and life adversities in order to achieve desired goals and maintain physical, mental, and social well-being.", "Socioeconomic status (SES) is known to have a considerable influence on the development of neuropsychological functions. In particular there is strong evidence for less efficient development of prefrontal-cortex-related functions in children raised in low-SES households. \"Street children\" are a common feature of low SES in many low- and middle-income countries, and some researchers have suggested that the unique life experiences of street children may drive their neurocognitive development. This study compares a group of 36 former street children in Quito, Ecuador with a control group of 26 never street-connected schoolchildren. All children were assessed with a range of neuropsychological tests. Although the street children group performed significantly below the level of the control group on all measures, they did not demonstrate a generalized lower ability. By controlling the effects of fluid intelligence it was found that there are relatively independent effects on visuospatial ability and executive planning ability. Furthermore, the executive function test scores in general are significantly less affected than the other cognitive functions and may be temporary effects caused by recent substance abuse within the street child sample. The findings generally support results from other countries suggesting that low SES is associated with negative effects on neuropsychological development. However, they also suggest that the local social and economic context, such as in the case of street children, might mitigate the harmful effects of low SES on the development of some executive functions.", "Gyrification of the cortical mantle is a dynamic process that increases with cortical surface area and decreases with age. Increased gyrification is associated with higher scores on cognitive tasks in adults; however, the degree to which this relationship is independent of cortical surface area remains undefined. This study investigates whether regional variation in gyrification is associated with domain-general and domain-specific cognition. Our hypothesis is that increased local gyrification confers a functional advantage that is independent of surface area. To quantify regional gyrification, we computed the local gyrification index (LGI) at each vertex and averaged across a bilateral parietal-frontal region associated with general intelligence and reasoning (Jung and Haier 2007). A sample of 48 healthy adults (24 males/24 females; ages 18-68\u00a0years) completed a high-resolution 3\u00a0T T1-weighted MRI and standardized administration of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS). We found a positive correlation between cortical gyrification and working memory, which remained significant after controlling for cortical surface area. Results suggest that a higher degree of local cortical folding confers a functional advantage that is independent from surface area and evident for more dynamic or \"fluid\" cognitive processes (i.e., working memory) rather than over-learned or \"crystallized\" cognitive processes.", "An important aspect of successful aging is maintaining the ability to solve everyday problems encountered in daily life. The limited evidence today suggests that everyday problem solving ability increases from young adulthood to middle age, but decreases in older age.\nThe present study examined age differences in the relative contributions of fluid and crystallized abilities to solving problems on the Everyday Problems Test (EPT). We hypothesized that due to diminishing fluid resources available with advanced age, crystallized knowledge would become increasingly important in predicting everyday problem solving with greater age.\nTwo hundred and twenty-one healthy adults from the Dallas Lifespan Brain Study, aged 24-93 years, completed a cognitive battery that included measures of fluid ability (i.e., processing speed, working memory, inductive reasoning) and crystallized ability (i.e., multiple measures of vocabulary). These measures were used to predict performance on EPT.\nEveryday problem solving showed an increase in performance from young to early middle age, with performance beginning to decrease at about age of 50 years. As hypothesized, fluid ability was the primary predictor of performance on everyday problem solving for young adults, but with increasing age, crystallized ability became the dominant predictor.\nThis study provides evidence that everyday problem solving ability differs with age, and, more importantly, that the processes underlying it differ with age as well. The findings indicate that older adults increasingly rely on knowledge to support everyday problem solving, whereas young adults rely almost exclusively on fluid intelligence.", "The aim of this study was to develop a neuropsychometric battery for the differential diagnosis of specific learning disability (SLD), with specific respect to attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and to help resolve the conflicting results in the literature by an integrative utilization of scores on both the Bannatyne categories and neuropsychological tests.\nThe sample included 168 primary school boys who were assigned to SLD (n=21), ADHD (n=45), SLD and ADHD (n=57), and control groups (n=45). The exclusion criteria were a neurological or psychiatric comorbidity other than ADHD, a level of anxiety and/or depression above the cutoff score, medication affecting cognitive processes, visual and/or auditory disorders, and an intelligence level outside the IQ range of 85-129. Psychometric scores were obtained from the SLD Battery and Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised in the form of Bannatyne category scores. Neuropsychological scores were from the Visual-Aural Digit Span Test-Form B, Serial Digit Learning Test, Judgment of Line Orientation, and Mangina Test. The battery was called the Integrative Battery of SLD.\nThe correctness of estimation for classifying cases into the diagnostic dyads (SLD/ADHD, SLD/SLD+ADHD, and SLD+ADHD/ADHD) by an integrative utilization of both the Bannatyne category scores (n=4) and scores from the four neuropsychological tests (n=10) was 92.4%, 81.4%, and 71.8%, respectively. These proportions were generally higher than those obtained using the Bannatyne category scores alone (86.4%, 75.5%, and 73.1%, respectively). The same trend was seen in the classification of children into diagnostic and control groups. However, the proportion of the correctness of estimation was higher than that obtained for the diagnostic dyads.\nWhen conducted using appropriately chosen research designs and statistical techniques and if confounding variables are sufficiently controlled, a neuropsychometric battery that includes capacities that relate to intelligence (Bannatyne categories) and those that relate to neurocognitive processes (neuropsychological tests) can be useful in the differential diagnosis of SLD.", "The Levels of Emotional Awareness Scale (LEAS; Lane, Quinlan, Schwartz, Walker, & Zeitlin, 1990 ) is an open-ended measure of the ability to describe emotional reactions. Scoring the LEAS by hand is complex and time consuming (Barchard, Bajgar, Leaf, & Lane, 2010 ). Therefore, Program for Open-Ended Scoring (POES; Leaf & Barchard, 2010 ) was designed to score the LEAS quickly and easily. Using 268 undergraduates, this article compares traditional LEAS hand scoring to 6 POES methods, 2 of which are holistic methods that have never before been examined. Based on split-half reliability, correlations with measures of emotional and social intelligence, and partial correlations once response length and vocabulary were partialed out, we recommend 3 of the POES methods when testing nonclinical samples of young adults. Because POES scoring is fast and efficient, it allows more researchers and clinicians to use the LEAS, thus moving away from self-report measures of emotional awareness.", "Enabling touch-sensing capability would help appliances understand interaction behaviors with their surroundings. Many recent studies are focusing on the development of electronic skin because of its necessity in various application domains, namely autonomous artificial intelligence (e.g., robots), biomedical instrumentation, and replacement prosthetic devices. An essential task of the electronic skin system is to locally process the tactile data and send structured information either to mimic human skin or to respond to the application demands. The electronic skin must be fabricated together with an embedded electronic system which has the role of acquiring the tactile data, processing, and extracting structured information. On the other hand, processing tactile data requires efficient methods to extract meaningful information from raw sensor data. Machine learning represents an effective method for data analysis in many domains: it has recently demonstrated its effectiveness in processing tactile sensor data. In this framework, this paper presents the implementation of digital signal processing based on FPGAs for tactile data processing. It provides the implementation of a tensorial kernel function for a machine learning approach. Implementation results are assessed by highlighting the FPGA resource utilization and power consumption. Results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed implementation when real-time classification of input touch modalities are targeted.", "Patients under radiotherapy for head-and-neck cancer often suffer of long-term xerostomia, and/or consistent shrinkage of parotid glands. In order to avoid these drawbacks, adaptive therapy can be planned for patients at risk, if the prediction is obtained timely, before or during the early phase of treatment. Artificial intelligence can address the problem, by learning from examples and building classification models. In particular, fuzzy logic has shown its suitability for medical applications, in order to manage uncertain data, and to build transparent rule-based classifiers. In previous works, clinical, dosimetric and image-based features were considered separately, to find different possible predictors of parotid shrinkage. On the other hand, a few works reported possible image-based predictors of xerostomia, while the combination of different types of features has been little addressed.\nThis paper proposes the application of a novel machine learning approach, based on both statistics and fuzzy logic, aimed at the classification of patients at risk of i) parotid gland shrinkage and ii) 12-months xerostomia. Both problems are addressed with the aim of individuating predictors and models to classify respective outcomes.\nKnowledge is extracted from a real dataset of radiotherapy patients, by means of a recently developed method named Likelihood-Fuzzy Analysis, based on the representation of statistical information by fuzzy rule-based models. This method enables to manage heterogeneous variables and missing data, and to obtain interpretable fuzzy models presenting good generalization power (thus high performance), and to measure classification confidence. Numerous features are extracted to characterize patients, coming from different sources, i.e. clinical features, dosimetric parameters, and radiomics-based measures obtained by texture analysis of Computed Tomography images. A learning approach based on the composition of simple models in a more complicated one allows to consider the features separately, in order to identify predictors and models to use when only some data source is available, and obtaining more accurate results when more information can be combined.\nRegarding parotid shrinkage, a number of good predictors is detected, some already known and confirmed here, and some others found here, in particular among radiomics-based features. A number of models are also designed, some using single features and others involving models composition to improve classification accuracy. In particular, the best model to be used at the initial treatment stage, and another one applicable at the half treatment stage are identified. Regarding 12-months toxicity, some possible predictors are detected, in particular among radiomics-based features. Moreover, the relation between final parotid shrinkage rate and 12-months xerostomia is evaluated. The method is compared to the na\u00efve Bayes classifier, which reveals similar results in terms of classification accuracy and best predictors. The interpretable fuzzy rule-based models are explicitly presented, and the dependence between predictors and outcome is explained, thus furnishing in some cases helpful insights about the considered problems.\nThanks to the performance and interpretability of the fuzzy classification method employed, predictors of both parotid shrinkage and xerostomia are detected, and their influence on each outcome is revealed. Moreover, models for predicting parotid shrinkage at initial and half radiotherapy stages are found.", "Given the potential role of the 5-hydroxytryptamine-3 receptor in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia, this study was performed to determine whether ondansetron plus risperidone could reduce the negative and depressive symptoms in patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia.\nIn a double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized trial (IRCT registration # 201112125280N7), in 2012-2013 in Mashhad, Iran, 38 patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia received risperidone either combined with a fixed dose (4-8 mg/d) of ondansetron (n=18) or with a placebo (n=20) for 12 weeks. The patients were evaluated using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), Wechsler's Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised (WAIS-R), and Hamilton's Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD) at baseline and 12 weeks later. Changes in the inventories were used to evaluate the efficacy of the treatment. The t test, Chi-square test, and SPSS (version 16) were used to analyze the data. The statistical significance was set atP<0.05.\nOndansetron plus risperidone was associated with a significantly larger improvement in the PANSS overall scale and subscales for negative symptoms and cognition than was risperidone plus placebo (P<0.001). The WAIS-R scale results indicated significant differences between the 2 groups before and after administrating the medicine and the placebo. The administration of ondansetron significantly improved visual memory based on the subtests of the WAIS (P<0.05). Ondansetron had no positive effects on depressive symptoms (effect size=0.13).\nThis study confirmed that ondansetron, as an adjunct treatment, reduces negative symptoms in patients with schizophrenia and can be used as a potential adjunctive strategy particularly for negative symptoms and cognitive impairments. Trial Registration Number: IRCT201112125280N7.", "The present study explores savouring, defined as the process of attending to positive experiences, as a mediator in the relationships between resiliency, trait emotional intelligence (EI), and subjective mental health in older adults. Following Fredrickson's Broaden and Build Theory of positive emotions, the present study aims to extend our understanding of the underlying processes that link resiliency and trait EI with self-reported mental health in older adulthood.\nA sample of 149 adults aged 65 and over (M = 73.72) were recruited from retirement homes and community groups. Participants completed measures of resiliency, savouring, trait EI, and subjective mental health either online or in a paper format.\nPath analysis revealed that savouring fully mediated the relationship between resiliency and mental health. However, trait EI did not significantly predict mental health in this sample.\nThese findings provided partial support for the Broaden and Build Theory of positive emotions. As anticipated, savouring imitated the broadening effect of positive emotions by mediating the relationship between resiliency and mental health. However, savouring failed to reflect the undoing effect of positive emotions and did not mediate the relationship between EI and mental health. These findings have implications for positive psychology exercises and may be a simple, yet effective means of improving the life quality of older adults.", "Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and metals (lead and cadmium) are neurotoxic and affect neurobehavioral performance. Yet little is known about the association between exposure to multiple neurotoxic compounds and cognitive functioning in older adults.\nUsing data from two consecutive cycles of the National Health and Nutrition and Examination Survey (1999-2002), path analysis was used to simultaneously evaluate the association between whole blood concentrations of 14 neurotoxic compounds and cognitive functioning measured by the Digit Symbol Coding Test of the Weschler Adult Intelligence Scale, 3rd Edition in participants 60-84 years of age (N\u2009=\u2009498). Effect modification was assessed for age (above/below the mean) and sex.\nThe final path model fit 5 compounds (i.e. PCB 74, PCB 118, PCB 146, PCB 153, and lead). After controlling for co-exposures and confounders, PCB 146 (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009-0.16, 95% CI: -0.29, -0.02, p\u2009=\u20090.02) and lead (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009-0.10, 95% CI: -0.20, -0.006, p\u2009=\u20090.04) were negatively associated with DSC scores in 60-84 year olds. Whereas, PCB 153 was positively associated with DSC scores (\u03b2 =0.20, 95% CI: 0.05, 0.35; p\u2009=\u20090.01).\nThis cross-sectional analysis which controlled for collinear exposure to several neurotoxic compounds demonstrated an association between non-dioxin like polychlorinated biphenyl exposure, specifically PCB 146, and lower cognitive functioning, in older adults. Lead exposure was also weakly associated with lower cognitive functioning. Additional studies are needed to determine the causality of the observed associations.", "To investigate growth patterns and anthropometrics in former extremely low birth weight (ELBW, <1000 g) children and link these outcomes to neurocognition and body composition in childhood.\nELBW children were examined at birth (n = 140), at 9 and 24 months (n\u226596) and at approximately 11 years within the framework of the PREMATCH (PREMATurity as predictor children's of Cardiovascular and renal Health) case-control (n = 93-87) study. Regional growth charts were used to convert anthropometrics into Z-scores. Catch-up growth in the first two years of life was qualified as present if \u0394Z-score >0.67 SDS. At 11 years, anthropometrics, neurocognitive performance, body composition, grip strength and puberty scores were assessed.\nELBW neonates displayed extra-uterine growth restriction with mean Z-scores for height, weight and head circumference of -0.77, -0.93 and -0.46 at birth, -1.61, -1.67 and -0.72 at 9 months, -1.22, -1.61 and -0.84 at 24 months, and -0.42, -0.49 and -1.09 at 11 years. ELBW children performed consistently worse on neurocognitive testing with an average intelligence quotient equivalent at 11 years of 92.5 (SD 13.1). Catch-up growth was not associated with neurocognitive performance. Compared to controls, ELBW cases had lower grip strength (13.6 vs. 15.9 kg) and percentage lean body weight (75.1 vs. 80.5%), but higher body fat (24.6 vs. 19.2%) and advanced puberty scores at 11 years (all P\u22640.025). Catch-up growth for weight and height in the first two years of life in cases was associated with a lower percentage body fat compared to cases without catch-up growth (16.8% catch-up growth for weight vs. 25.7%, P<0.001; 20.9% catch-up for height vs. 25.8%, P = 0.049).\nIn young adolescence, former ELBW children still have difficulties to reach their target height. Compared to normal birth weight controls, ELBW adolescents show lower neurocognitive performance and grip strength and a higher percentage body fat, a potential risk factor for adverse health outcomes in adulthood. Our key finding is that catch-up growth in ELBW children in the first two years of life is associated with a lower percentage body fat and is therefore likely to be beneficial.", "Individuals with sickle cell anemia may suffer symptomatic or silent cerebral infarcts leading to neurocognitive complications. This study investigated the cognitive and intellectual performance of children and adolescents with sickle cell anemia.\nThe socioeconomic status, clinical aspects and behavioral profile of 15 young individuals with sickle cell anemia were evaluated. The Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, the Developmental Neuropsychological Assessment Test, and the Child Behavior Checklist were applied.\nParticipants with a history of stroke had lower intelligence quotient (IQ) scores. Alterations were found in attention and executive functioning, language, verbal and visual memory, visuospatial processing and sensorimotor skills. These alterations were found both in the children and adolescents who had had a cerebral infarction and in those who apparently had not. In the majority of cases, there were learning difficulties, a history of repeating school years and a need for specialist educational support. The most common additional diagnoses in accordance with the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV were depressive disorder, anxiety disorder and somatic disorder, as well as conditions associated with physical and psychosocial repercussions of sickle cell anemia.\nAs sickle cell anemia is considered a progressive cerebral vasculopathy, it is a potential risk factor for neurocognitive and psychosocial development. Therefore, periodic neuropsychological and behavioral evaluations of children and adolescents with sickle cell anemia may represent a useful measure to reduce long-term biopsychosocial repercussions.", "A high percentage of medical errors, committed because of physician's lack of experience, huge volume of data to be analyzed, and inaccessibility to medical records of previous patients, can be reduced using computer-aided techniques. Therefore, designing more efficient medical decision-support systems (MDSSs) to assist physicians in decision-making is crucially important. Through combining the properties of fuzzy logic and neural networks, fuzzy cognitive maps (FCMs) are among the latest, most efficient, and strongest artificial intelligence techniques for modeling complex systems. This review study is conducted to identify different FCM structures used in MDSS designs. The best structure for each medical application can be introduced by studying the properties of FCM structures.\nThis paper surveys the most important decision- making methods and applications of FCMs in the medical field in recent years. To investigate the efficiency and capability of different FCM models in designing MDSSs, medical applications are categorized into four key areas: decision-making, diagnosis, prediction, and classification. Also, various diagnosis and decision support problems addressed by FCMs in recent years are reviewed with the goal of introducing different types of FCMs and determining their contribution to the improvements made in the fields of medical diagnosis and treatment.\nIn this survey, a general trend for future studies in this field is provided by analyzing various FCM structures used for medical purposes, and the results from each category.\nDue to the unique specifications of FCMs in integrating human knowledge and experience with computer-aided techniques, they are among practical instruments for MDSS design. In the not too distant future, they will have a significant role in medical sciences.", "The influence of visuo-spatial skills on numerical magnitude processing is the subject of a long-standing debate. As most of the numerical and non-numerical magnitude abilities underpinning mathematical development are visual by nature, they are often assessed in the visual modality, thereby confusing visuo-spatial and numerical processing. In order to assess the influence of visuo-spatial processing on numerical magnitude representation, we examined magnitude processing in patients with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS), a genetic condition characterized by a cognitive profile with a relative weakness in visuo-spatial abilities but with preserved verbal abilities. Twenty-seven participants with 22q11DS were compared to two control groups (one matched on verbal intelligence and the other on visuo-spatial abilities) on several magnitude comparison tasks each with different visuo-spatial processing requirements. Our results showed that participants with 22q11DS present a consistent pattern of impairment in magnitude comparison tasks requiring the processing of visuo-spatial dimensions: comparison of lengths and collections. In contrast, their performance did not differ from the control groups in a visual task with no spatial processing requirement (i.e. numerical comparison of flashed dot sequences) or in auditory tasks (i.e., duration comparison and numerical comparison of sound sequences). Finally, a specific deficit of enumeration processes was observed in the subitizing range. Taken together, these results show that deficits in magnitude can occur as a consequence of a visuo-spatial deficit. This highlights the influence of the nature of the tasks selected to assess magnitude representation.", "Video analysis and understanding play a central role in visual intelligence. In this paper, we aim to analyze unconstrained videos, by designing features and approaches to represent and analyze videography styles in the videos. Videography denotes the process of making videos. The unconstrained videos are defined as the long duration consumer videos that usually have diverse editing artifacts and significant complexity of contents. We propose to construct a videography dictionary, which can be utilized to represent every video clip as a sequence of videography words. In addition to semantic features, such as foreground object motion and camera motion, we also incorporate two novel interpretable features to characterize videography, including the scale information and the motion correlations. We then demonstrate that, by using statistical analysis methods, the unique videography signatures extracted from different events can be automatically identified. For real-world applications, we explore the use of videography analysis for three types of applications, including content-based video retrieval, video summarization (both visual and textual), and videography-based feature pooling. In the experiments, we evaluate the performance of our approach and other methods on a large-scale unconstrained video dataset, and show that the proposed approach significantly benefits video analysis in various ways.", "We sought to assess the effect of congenital heart disease requiring infant surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass on neurodevelopmental outcomes and growth at 4\u00a0years of age, while matching for gestational age, socioeconomic status, maternal gestational conditions, home environment, and parental intelligence by studying multiple-gestation births.\nWe performed within-family comparison of 14 multiple-gestation births in which 1 child had congenital heart disease requiring surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass at \u22646\u00a0months of age. Between 4 and 5\u00a0years of age, a comprehensive neurodevelopmental assessment was performed. Paired comparisons were conducted between siblings with and without heart defects using a series of nonparametric tests.\nOn average, the children qualified as late preterm (mean gestational age 35.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.6\u00a0weeks). At an average age of 4.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.1\u00a0years, children with congenital heart disease weighed less than their siblings (median weight for age z score -0.4 vs 0.1, P\u00a0=\u00a0.02) and had worse performance for cognition (median full-scale IQ 99 vs 109, P\u00a0=\u00a0.02) and fine motor skills (median Wide Range Assessment of Visual Motor Ability, Fine Motor score 94.5 vs 107.5, P\u00a0<\u00a0.01).\nAfter controlling for socioeconomic status, home environment, parental intelligence, and gestational factors by using multiple-gestation births, congenital heart disease requiring surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass at \u22646\u00a0months of age is associated with lower weight, cognitive abilities and fine motor skills at 4\u00a0years of age.", "Emotional intelligence (EI) is known to be a risk factor for several types of addiction. The purpose of this study was to investigate, in a cross-sectional design, the presence of a relationship between the level of EI and nicotine dependence in a sample of Lebanese adults. A self-administered questionnaire was used to determine the sociodemographic characteristics, the level of nicotine dependence, and the level of EI in a sample of 142 Lebanese participants from the community. The sample was 51.4% women, with a mean age of 33.9\u00a0years. There was no difference in EI level between smokers and non-smokers (p\u00a0=\u00a00.66), and there were no associations between EI level and the level of nicotine dependence (p\u00a0=\u00a00.59). However, EI was positively correlated with age (p\u00a0=\u00a00.023). Due to the fact that smokers have been dependent on nicotine for many years and that EI is known to increase with age, findings suggest that low EI may be a risk factor for initiation, rather than maintenance, of nicotine dependence.", "Kabuki syndrome (KS-OMIM 147920) is a rare developmental disease characterized by the association of multiple congenital anomalies and intellectual disability. This study aimed to investigate intellectual performance in children with KS and link the performance to several clinical features and molecular data. We recruited 31 children with KMT2D mutations who were 6 to 16 years old. They all completed the Weschler Intelligence Scale for Children, fourth edition. We calculated all indexes: the Full Scale Intellectual Quotient (FSIQ), Verbal Comprehension Index (VCI), Perceptive Reasoning Index (PRI), Processing Speed Index (PSI), and Working Memory Index (WMI). In addition, molecular data and several clinical symptoms were studied. FSIQ and VCI scores were 10 points lower for patients with a truncating mutation than other types of mutations. In addition, scores for FSIQ, VCI and PRI were lower for children with visual impairment than normal vision. We also identified a discrepancy in indexes characterized by high WMI and VCI and low PRI and PSI. We emphasize the importance of early identification and intensive care of visual disorders in patients with KS and recommend individual assessment of intellectual profile.", "Patients suffering from pituitary adenomas may experience cognitive dysfunctions due to hormonal imbalance or suprasellar tumor extension displacing neural structures. Progressively enlarging or symptomatic nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas with suprasellar extension are frequently resected. The literature on neurocognitive performance surrounding resection of these lesions is sparse.\nA prospective matched-control study was conducted to investigate the impact of nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas with suprasellar extension on preoperative and postoperative cognitive performance. Controls were matched for age, sex, handedness, education, and profession. The neurocognitive test battery included perceptual speed, executive function, visual-spatial and verbal working memory, short- and long-term memory, verbal fluency, fluid intelligence, anxiety, and depression.\nTen patients and 10 healthy controls were matched. Median suprasellar tumor extension scored 8mm, compression of frontal lobe parenchyma was present in all cases. Median sagittal tumor diameter was 21mm. Preoperatively, patients scored worse in perceptual speed and short-term memory tasks. All patients underwent surgical resection either through a transnasal, transsphenoidal approach or a supraorbital frontolateral keyhole approach. The short-term memory deficit disappeared one week after surgery. Perceptual speed recovered within two months after surgical therapy. None of the patients experienced worsening of cognitive function. Routine postoperative imaging at six months did not reveal displacement of neural structures or surgery-related complications in any of the patients.\nPatients suffering from nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas with suprasellar extension may experience preoperative impairments in some neurocognitive domains that resolve within two months after surgery. The risk for cognitive deterioration with surgery appears to be low.", "The advancement of information technology in financial applications nowadays have led to fast market-driven events that prompt flash decision-making and actions issued by computer algorithms. As a result, today's markets experience intense activity in the highly dynamic environment where trading systems respond to others at a much faster pace than before. This new breed of technology involves the implementation of high-speed trading strategies which generate significant portion of activity in the financial markets and present researchers with a wealth of information not available in traditional low-speed trading environments. In this study, we aim at developing feasible computational intelligence methodologies, particularly genetic algorithms (GA), to shed light on high-speed trading research using price data of stocks on the microscopic level. Our empirical results show that the proposed GA-based system is able to improve the accuracy of the prediction significantly for price movement, and we expect this GA-based methodology to advance the current state of research for high-speed trading and other relevant financial applications.", "Historically, domains such as business intelligence would require a single analyst to engage with data, develop a model, answer operational questions, and predict future behaviors. However, as the problems and domains become more complex, organizations are employing teams of analysts to explore and model data to generate knowledge. Furthermore, given the rapid increase in data collection, organizations are struggling to develop practices for intelligence analysis in the era of big data. Currently, a variety of machine learning and data mining techniques are available to model data and to generate insights and predictions, and developments in the field of visual analytics have focused on how to effectively link data mining algorithms with interactive visuals to enable analysts to explore, understand, and interact with data and data models. Although studies have explored the role of single analysts in the visual analytics pipeline, little work has explored the role of teamwork and visual analytics in the analysis of big data. In this article, we present an experiment integrating statistical models, visual analytics techniques, and user experiments to study the role of teamwork in predictive analytics. We frame our experiment around the analysis of social media data for box office prediction problems and compare the prediction performance of teams, groups, and individuals. Our results indicate that a team's performance is mediated by the team's characteristics such as openness of individual members to others' positions and the type of planning that goes into the team's analysis. These findings have important implications for how organizations should create teams in order to make effective use of information from their analytic models.", "For children with sickle cell disease (SCD) and at low risk category of stroke, we aim to build a predictive model to differentiate those with decline of intelligence-quotient (IQ) from counterparts without decline, based on structural magnetic-resonance (MR) imaging volumetric analysis.\nThis preliminary prospective cohort study included 25 children with SCD, homozygous for hemoglobin S, with no history of stroke and transcranial Doppler mean velocities below 170cm/s at baseline. We administered the Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test (K-BIT) to each child at yearly intervals for 2-4 years. Each child underwent MR examination within 30 days of the baseline K-BIT evaluation date. We calculated K-BIT change rates, and used rate of change in K-BIT to classify children into two groups: a decline group and a non-decline group. We then generated predictive models to predict K-BIT decline/non-decline based on regional gray-matter (GM) volumes computed from structural MR images.\nWe identified six structures (the left median cingulate gyrus, the right middle occipital gyrus, the left inferior occipital gyrus, the right fusiform gyrus, the right middle temporal gyrus, the right inferior temporal gyrus) that, when assessed for volume at baseline, are jointly predictive of whether a child would suffer subsequent K-BIT decline. Based on these six regional GM volumes and the baseline K-BIT, we built a prognostic model using the K* algorithm. The accuracy, sensitivity and specificity were 0.84, 0.78 and 0.86, respectively.\nGM volumetric analysis predicts subsequent IQ decline for children with SCD.", "Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common sleep disorder. The, literature lacks studies examining sleep, cognition, and Alzheimer's Disease (AD) cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers in OSA patients. Therefore, we first studied cognitive performances, polysomnographic sleep, and CSF \u03b2-amyloid42, tau proteins, and lactate levels in patients affected by subjective cognitive impairment (SCI) divided in three groups: OSA patients (showing an Apnea-Hypopnea Index [AHI] \u226515/hr), controls (showing an AHI < 15/hr), and patients with OSA treated by continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP).\nWe compared results among 25 OSA, 10 OSA-CPAP, and 15 controls who underwent a protocol counting neuropsychological testing in the morning, 48-hr polysomnography followed by CSF analysis.\nOSA patients showed lower CSF A\u03b242 concentrations, higher CSF lactate levels, and higher t-tau/A\u03b242 ratio compared to controls and OSA-CPAP patients. OSA patients also showed reduced sleep quality and continuity and lower performances at memory, intelligence, and executive tests than controls and OSA-CPAP patients. We found significant relationships among higher CSF tau proteins levels, sleep impairment, and increased CSF lactate levels in the OSA group. Moreover, lower CSF A\u03b242 levels correlate with memory impairment and nocturnal oxygen saturation parameters in OSA patients.\nWe hypothesize that OSA reducing sleep quality and producing intermittent hypoxia lowers CSF A\u03b242 levels, increases CSF lactate levels, and alters cognitive performances in SCI patients, thus inducing early AD clinical and neuropathological biomarkers changes. Notably, controls as well as OSA-CPAP SCI patients did not show clinical and biochemical AD markers. Therefore, OSA may induce early but possibly CPAP-modifiable AD biomarkers changes.", "Many studies have demonstrated that listeners use information extracted from verbs to guide anticipatory eye movements to objects in the visual context that satisfy the selection restrictions of the verb. An important question is what underlies such verb-mediated anticipatory eye gaze. Based on empirical and theoretical suggestions, we investigated the influence of 5 potential predictors of this behavior: functional associations and general associations between verb and target object, as well as the listeners' production fluency, receptive vocabulary knowledge, and nonverbal intelligence. In 3 eye-tracking experiments, participants looked at sets of 4 objects and listened to sentences where the final word was predictable or not predictable (e.g., \"The man peels/draws an apple\"). On predictable trials only the target object, but not the distractors, were functionally and associatively related to the verb. In Experiments 1 and 2, objects were presented before the verb was heard. In Experiment 3, participants were given a short preview of the display after the verb was heard. Functional associations and receptive vocabulary were found to be important predictors of verb-mediated anticipatory eye gaze independent of the amount of contextual visual input. General word associations did not and nonverbal intelligence was only a very weak predictor of anticipatory eye movements. Participants' production fluency correlated positively with the likelihood of anticipatory eye movements when participants were given the long but not the short visual display preview. These findings fit best with a pluralistic approach to predictive language processing in which multiple mechanisms, mediating factors, and situational context dynamically interact.

Dental professionals ask patients to rely on their expertise, making it incumbent on the dental team to understand the materials in use. The author explores how to leverage the technological advancements with the uniqueness of the dental professional's personal touch to create implant-supported solid zirconia hybrid restorations. The tips and strategies shared in this article will enhance both efficiency and predictability.", "Specific learning disabilities (SLDs) are an important cause of academic underachievement in children and are also associated with comorbidities like attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) which further have an impact on the child's education.\nTo estimate the prevalence and psychosocial profile and psychiatric comorbidities in children with SLD in two settings, i.e., on special (remedial) education and schools and to compare the findings with normal children.\nThis study was carried out in schools situated in urban and semi-urban areas and special education schools. A total of 96 children were chosen for the study. After taking informed consent from the parents, the details about socioeconomic status, family, developmental history, and school history of the children were collected on a semi-structured pro forma and then the children were screened for SLD. They were administered colored/standard progressive matrices and Malin's intelligence scale for assessing their intelligence quotient and NIMHANS SLD index and developmental psychopathology checklist to study psychopathology. Chi-square test and ANOVA were done.\nThe prevalence of SLD in schools is found out to be 6.6%. There was a significant association with prematurity, cesarean section, delayed speech, and family history of SLD. Among comorbidities of SLD, association with ADHD alone has been found to be significant.\nThe most common type of SLD is combined type comorbid with ADHD. There is a need for early identification of learning disabilities in schools so that with early recognition and remedial intervention children can be helped with to cope with studies.", "To describe the 1-year neurobehavioral outcome of survivors of cardiac arrest secondary to drowning, compared with other respiratory etiologies, in children enrolled in the Therapeutic Hypothermia after Pediatric Cardiac Arrest Out-of-Hospital (THAPCA-OH) trial.\nExploratory analysis of survivors (ages 1-18 years) who received chest compressions for \u22652min, were comatose, and required mechanical ventilation after return of circulation (ROC). Participants recruited from 27 pediatric intensive care units in North America received targeted temperature management [therapeutic hypothermia (33\u00b0C) or therapeutic normothermia (36.8\u00b0C)] within 6h of ROC. Neurobehavioral outcomes included 1-year Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, Second Edition (VABS-II) total and domain scores and age-appropriate cognitive performance measures (Mullen Scales of Early Learning or Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence).\nSixty-six children with a respiratory etiology of cardiac arrest survived for 1-year; 60/66 had broadly normal premorbid functioning (VABS-II\u226570). Follow up was obtained on 59/60 (30 with drowning etiology). VABS-II composite and domain scores declined significantly from premorbid scores in drowning and non-drowning groups (p<0.001), although declines were less pronounced for the drowning group. Seventy-two percent of children had well below average cognitive functioning at 1-year. Younger age, fewer doses of epinephrine, and drowning etiology were associated with better VABS-II composite scores. Demographic variables and treatment with hypothermia did not influence neurobehavioral outcomes.\nRisks for poor neurobehavioral outcomes were high for children who were comatose after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest due to respiratory etiologies; survivors of drowning had better outcomes than those with other respiratory etiologies.", "Between 1984 and 1998, people living in Arica were involuntarily exposed to metal-containing waste stored in the urban area. The study aims to determine whether children who lived near the waste disposal site during early childhood experienced negative effects on their cognitive development. The cognitive performance was assessed using the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children. The exposure variable was defined by the year of birth in three categories: (1) Pre-remediation (born before 1999); (2) During-remediation (born between 1999 and 2003); and (3) Post-remediation (born after 2003). In the crude analysis, a difference of 10 points in the IQ average was observed between the group born in the pre- (81.9 points) and post-remediation period (91.1 points). The difference between both groups was five times higher as compared to children of similar age and socioeconomic status in other cities of Chile. This result could be related with a period of high potential for exposure to this contaminated site.", "Mosquito-borne diseases account for multiple public health challenges in our modern world. The international health community has seen a number of mosquito-borne diseases come to the forefront in recent years, including West Nile virus, Chikungunya virus, and currently, Zika virus. Predicting the spread of mosquito-borne disease can aid early decision support for when and how to employ public health interventions within a community; however, accurate and fast predictions, months into the future, are difficult to achieve in urgent scenarios, particularly when little information is known about infection rates. New sources of information including social media have been proposed to accelerate the development of predictive models of disease progression. In this research, we adapted a previously described model for the spread of mosquito-borne disease using open intelligence sources. The novel implementation of a mixed-model for mosquito-borne disease was capable of being executed in minimal runtime. The results indicate that this model yields fast and relevant results with acceptable margins of error.", "Intelligence, in most people's conception, involves combining pieces of evidence to reach non-obvious conclusions. A recent theoretical study shows that intelligence-like brain functions can emerge from simple neural circuits, in this case the honeybee mushroom body.", "Cross-cultural comparisons provide critical insight into variation in reasoning about intelligence. In two studies, the authors used a novel methodology based on multivocal ethnography to assess the role of conformity in U.S. and Ni-Vanuatu adults' judgments of children's intelligence and, as a comparison trait, good behavior. In Study 1, there were cultural differences in the impact of conformity on U.S. and Ni-Vanuatu adults' judgments of children's intelligence and good behavior. When evaluating U.S. children only, U.S. adults were less likely to endorse high conformity children as intelligent, often citing creativity as a justification for their judgments. In contrast, Ni-Vanuatu adults were more likely to endorse Ni-Vanuatu high conformity children as intelligent. Ni-Vanuatu adults were also more likely to endorse high conformity children as well-behaved than U.S. adults. In Study 2, there were no effects of socioeconomic status on U.S. adults' evaluations of conformity. U.S. adults were less likely to endorse high conformity children as intelligent than Ni-Vanuatu adults. Taken together, the data demonstrate that beliefs about the relations between intelligence, conformity, and creativity vary within and across cultures. (PsycINFO Database Record", "In this paper, we investigate into the problem of image quality assessment (IQA) and enhancement via machine learning. This issue has long attracted a wide range of attention in computational intelligence and image processing communities, since, for many practical applications, e.g., object detection and recognition, raw images are usually needed to be appropriately enhanced to raise the visual quality (e.g., visibility and contrast). In fact, proper enhancement can noticeably improve the quality of input images, even better than originally captured images, which are generally thought to be of the best quality. In this paper, we present two most important contributions. The first contribution is to develop a new no-reference (NR) IQA model. Given an image, our quality measure first extracts 17 features through analysis of contrast, sharpness, brightness and more, and then yields a measure of visual quality using a regression module, which is learned with big-data training samples that are much bigger than the size of relevant image data sets. The results of experiments on nine data sets validate the superiority and efficiency of our blind metric compared with typical state-of-the-art full-reference, reduced-reference and NA IQA methods. The second contribution is that a robust image enhancement framework is established based on quality optimization. For an input image, by the guidance of the proposed NR-IQA measure, we conduct histogram modification to successively rectify image brightness and contrast to a proper level. Thorough tests demonstrate that our framework can well enhance natural images, low-contrast images, low-light images, and dehazed images.

Despite overall improvement, there were minor differences between the adaptive and mock-training conditions. Moreover, dropout was relatively high (26%). In the current study we explored potential predicting and moderating factors to clarify these findings. The effects of intelligence, autism traits, WM, flexibility, reward sensitivity and Theory of Mind on dropout, improvement during training, and improvement in everyday executive functioning (EF), ASD-like behavior, and Quality of Life (QoL) were studied. None of the predictors influenced dropout or training improvement. However, 1) more pre-training autism traits related to less improvement in EF and QoL, and 2) higher reward sensitivity was related to more improvement in QoL and ASD-like behavior. These findings suggest that these EF-training procedures may be beneficial for children with fewer autism traits and higher reward sensitivity. However, the exploratory nature of the analyses warrant further research before applying the findings clinically.", "Sleep apnea syndrome (SAS), which can significantly decrease the quality of life is associated with a major risk factor of health implications such as increased cardiovascular disease, sudden death, depression, irritability, hypertension, and learning difficulties. Thus, it is relevant and timely to present a systematic review describing significant applications in the framework of computational intelligence-based SAS, including its performance, beneficial and challenging effects, and modeling for the decision-making on multiple scenarios.\nThis study aims to systematically review the literature on systems for the detection and/or prediction of apnea events using a classification model.\nForty-five included studies revealed a combination of classification techniques for the diagnosis of apnea, such as threshold-based (14.75%) and machine learning (ML) models (85.25%). In addition, the ML models, were clustered in a mind map, include neural networks (44.26%), regression (4.91%), instance-based (11.47%), Bayesian algorithms (1.63%), reinforcement learning (4.91%), dimensionality reduction (8.19%), ensemble learning (6.55%), and decision trees (3.27%).\nA classification model should provide an auto-adaptive and no external-human action dependency. In addition, the accuracy of the classification models is related with the effective features selection. New high-quality studies based on randomized controlled trials and validation of models using a large and multiple sample of data are recommended.", "Goal maintenance is the process where task rules and instructions are kept active to exert their control on behavior. When this process fails, an individual may ignore a rule while performing the task, despite being able to describe it after task completion. Previous research has suggested that the goal maintenance system is limited by the number of concurrent rules which can be maintained during a task, and that this limit is dependent on an individual's level of fluid intelligence. However, the speed at which an individual can process information may also limit their ability to use task rules when the task demands them. In the present study, four experiments manipulated the number of instructions to be maintained by younger and older adults and examined whether performance on a rapid letter-monitoring task was predicted by individual differences in fluid intelligence or processing speed. Fluid intelligence played little role in determining how frequently rules were ignored during the task, regardless of the number of rules to be maintained. In contrast, processing speed predicted the rate of goal neglect in older adults, where increasing the presentation rate of the letter-monitoring task increased goal neglect. These findings suggest that goal maintenance may be limited by the speed at which it can operate.", "Dietary intake during pregnancy may influence child neurodevelopment and cognitive function. This study aims to investigate the associations between dietary patterns obtained in pregnancy and intelligence quotients (IQ) among offspring at 8\u00a0years of age. Pregnant women enrolled in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children completed a food frequency questionnaire at 32\u00a0weeks' gestation (n\u00a0=\u00a012,195). Dietary patterns were obtained by cluster analysis. Three clusters best described women's diets during pregnancy: \"fruit and vegetables,\" \"meat and potatoes,\" and \"white bread and coffee.\" The offspring's IQ at 8\u00a0years of age was assessed using the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children. Models, using variables correlated to IQ data, were performed to impute missing values. Linear regression models were employed to investigate associations between the maternal clusters and IQ in childhood. Children of women who were classified in the meat and potatoes cluster and white bread and coffee cluster during pregnancy had lower average verbal (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-1.74; p\u00a0<\u00a0.001 and \u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-3.05; p\u00a0<\u00a0.001), performance (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-1.26; p\u00a0=\u00a0.011 and \u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-1.75; p\u00a0<\u00a0.001), and full-scale IQ (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-1.74; p\u00a0<\u00a0.001 and \u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-2.79; p\u00a0<\u00a0.001) at 8\u00a0years of age when compared to children of mothers in the fruit and vegetables cluster in imputed models of IQ and all confounders, after adjustment for a wide range of known confounders including maternal education. The pregnant women who were classified in the fruit and vegetables cluster had offspring with higher average IQ compared with offspring of mothers in the meat and potatoes cluster and white bread and coffee cluster.", "The arrival of modern brain imaging technologies has provided new opportunities for examining the biological essence of human intelligence as well as the relationship between brain size and cognition. Thanks to these advances, we can now state that the relationship between brain size and intelligence has never been well understood. This view is supported by findings showing that cognition is correlated more with brain tissues than sheer brain size. The complexity of cellular and molecular organization of neural connections actually determines the computational capacity of the brain. In this review article, we determine that while genotypes are responsible for defining the theoretical limits of intelligence, what is primarily responsible for determining whether those limits are reached or exceeded is experience (environmental influence). Therefore, we contend that the gene-environment interplay defines the intelligent quotient of an individual.", "The present study evaluated subjective and objective cognitive measures as predictors of fluid intelligence in healthy older adults. We hypothesized that objective cognitive measures would predict fluid intelligence to a greater degree than self-reported cognitive functioning. Ninety-three healthy older (>65 years old) community-dwelling adults participated. Raven's Advanced Progressive Matrices (RAPM) were used to measure fluid intelligence, Digit Span Sequencing (DSS) was used to measure working memory, Trail Making Test (TMT) was used to measure cognitive flexibility, Design Fluency Test (DFT) was used to measure creativity, and Tower Test (TT) was used to measure planning. The Cognitive Failures Questionnaire (CFQ) was used to measure subjective perceptions of cognitive functioning. RAPM was correlated with DSS, TT, and DFT. When CFQ was the only predictor, the regression model predicting fluid intelligence was not significant. When DSS, TMT, DFT, and TT were included in the model, there was a significant change in the model and the final model was also significant, with DFT as the only significant predictor. The model accounted for approximately 20% of the variability in fluid intelligence. Our findings suggest that the most reliable means of assessing fluid intelligence is to assess it directly.", "Vocabulary knowledge is used as a representative index of general intelligence, and is regarded as a marker for cognitive reserve in elderly people. However, vocabulary knowledge mainly depends on formal education, hence, it may not fully represent cognitive functioning in elderly people with poor educational backgrounds. Herein, we investigated whether vocabulary knowledge is a measure of general cognitive ability among normal elderly people with few years of formal education.\nThe association between vocabulary knowledge and general cognitive functioning was compared between 35 elderly females with very low educational attainment and 68 elderly females with higher education.\nThe vocabulary knowledge was a significant predictor of general cognitive functioning in elderly individuals with more than primary education, even after controlling the effects of age and years of education. However, it was not a significant predictor of general cognitive functioning in elderly individuals with very low educational attainment.\nVocabulary assessment was effective in estimating general cognitive functioning in elderly individuals who received \u22656 years of education. Our findings suggested that vocabulary knowledge may not be an effective proxy of premorbid intelligence or cognitive reserve in people who have not completed elementary schooling.", "In Portugal, 9.8% of patients admitted were inflicted with healthcare associated infections, corresponding to a prevalence of 11.7%. The Hospital de S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o has developed a business intelligence platform able to supervise (the patients), monitor (the clinical condition) and notify (the healthcare personnel): HViTAL. This study aims to assess the impact of electronic monitoring on healthcare associated infections since the year of HViTAL implementation.\nWe evaluated data since January 2008 (moment from which computerized records exist) until December 2011, comparing them with subsequent data, those corresponding to January 2012 (implementation date of HViTAL) until 19 October 2015.\nThere was an upward trend of infection parameters in the 2008 - 2011 period. Since January 2012 and October 2015, all parameters of the infection indicator showed a negative linear trend.\nThe results are very suggestive that the HVITAL may have had an impact on improving parameters associated to healthcare associated infections. Basic measures of infection control were highlighted since 2005, with an increasing number of health professional awareness campaigns, a fact which, although not analyzed in this report, may also have contributed to the observed improvement. Our study did not include other variables such as investment in human capital.\nThere was a clear improvement in all areas characterizing the healthcare associated infections, with obvious positive impact with the introduction of HViTAL.\nIntrodu\u00e7\u00e3o: Em Portugal, 9,8% dos doentes internados adquiriram infe\u00e7\u00f5es associadas aos cuidados de sa\u00fade, correspondendo a\u00a0uma preval\u00eancia de cerca 11,7%.

For the preclinical safety assessment of drug development, it is difficult to predict seizure-inducing side effects. Here, we introduced a machine learning-based in\u00a0vitro system designed to detect seizure-inducing side effects. We recorded local field potentials from the CA1 alveus in acute mouse neocortico-hippocampal slices, while 14 drugs were bath-perfused at 5 different concentrations each. For each experimental condition, we collected seizure-like neuronal activity and merged their waveforms as one graphic image, which was further converted into a feature vector using Caffe, an open framework for deep learning. In the space of the first two principal components, the support vector machine completely separated the vectors (i.e., doses of individual drugs) that induced seizure-like events and identified diphenhydramine, enoxacin, strychnine and theophylline as \"seizure-inducing\" drugs, which indeed were reported to induce seizures in clinical situations. Thus, this artificial intelligence-based classification may provide a new platform to detect the seizure-inducing side effects of preclinical drugs.", "Informaticians are challenged to design health information technology (IT) solutions for complex problems, such as health disparities, but are achieving mixed results in demonstrating a direct impact on health outcomes. This presentation of collective intelligence and the corresponding terms of smart health, knowledge ecosystem, enhanced health disparities informatics capacities, knowledge exchange, big-data, and situational awareness are a means of demonstrating the complex challenges informatics professionals face in trying to model, measure, and manage an intelligent and smart systems response to health disparities. A critical piece in our understanding of collective intelligence for public and population health rests in our understanding of public and population health as a living and evolving network of individuals, organizations, and resources. This discussion represents a step in advancing the conversation of what a smart response to health disparities should represent and how informatics can drive the design of intelligent systems to assist in eliminating health disparities and achieving health equity.", "It is generally considered that working memory (WM) capacity is limited and that WM capacity affects cognitive processes. Distractor filtering efficiency has been suggested to be an important factor in determining the visual working memory (VWM) capacity of individuals. In the present study, we investigated whether training in visual filtering efficiency (FE) could improve VWM capacity, as measured by performance on the change detection task (CDT) and changes of contralateral delay activity (CDA) (contralateral delay activity) of different conditions, and evaluated the transfer effect of visual FE training on verbal WM and fluid intelligence, as indexed by performance on the verbal WM span task and Raven's Standard Progressive Matrices (RSPM) test, respectively. Participants were divided into high- and low-capacity groups based on their performance in a CDT designed to test VWM capacity, and then the low-capacity individuals received 20 days of FE training. The training significantly improved the group's performance in the CDT, and their CDA models of different conditions became more similar with high capacity group, and the effect generalized to improve verbal WM span. These gains were maintained at a 3-month follow-up test. Participants' RSPM scores were not changed by the training. These findings support the notion that WM capacity is determined, at least in part, by distractor FE and can be enhanced through training.", "The aim of the present study was to investigate whether age-related brain response alterations during sentence comprehension exist when verbal fluency and intelligence are controlled for. Twenty-four younger and twenty-four older adults with matched verbal fluency, verbal intelligence, years of education, and gender ratio were recruited. They were asked to read congruent (CON) and incongruent (INCON) sentences to make semantic acceptability judgments. A significant group by condition interaction on accuracy was found, showing a significant congruency effect in younger, but not older adults. The ERP results revealed a dynamic temporal-spatial change in older adults. The congruency related N400 effect was reduced and delayed significantly in the older adults compared to the younger adults, and accompanied by different distribution patterns across time windows. The late positive component with more positive-going in the INCON condition than the CON condition was found in older adults only, which did not correlate with the performance, however. The results suggest that with age, there is a decline in semantic processing during sentence comprehension.", "Artificial intelligence algorithm performs on par with dermatologists to distinguish malignant from benign skin tumors.", "The gray matter abnormalities revealed by magnetic resonance imaging are inconsistent, especially in pediatric individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) (age\u00a0<\u00a018\u00a0years old), a phenomenon possibly related to the core pathophysiology of ASD. The purpose of our meta-analysis was to identify and map the specific gray matter abnormalities in pediatric ASD individuals thereby exploring the potential effects of clinical and demographic characteristics of these gray matter changes. A systematic search was conducted to identify voxel-based morphometry studies in pediatric individuals with ASD. The effect-size signed differential mapping method was used to quantitatively estimate the regional gray matter abnormalities in pediatric ASD individuals. Meta-regression was used to examine the associations among age, gender, intelligence quotient, symptom severity and gray matter changes. Fifteen studies including 364 pediatric individuals with ASD (male\u00a0=\u00a0282, age\u00a0=\u00a010.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.4\u00a0years) and 377 healthy controls (male\u00a0=\u00a0289, age\u00a0=\u00a010.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.2\u00a0years) were included. Pediatric ASD individuals showed significant gray matter increases in the right angular gyrus, left superior and middle frontal gyrus, left precuneus, left inferior occipital gyrus and right inferior temporal gyrus, most of which involving the default mode network, and decreases in the left cerebellum and left postcentral gyrus. The meta-regression analysis showed that the repetitive behavior scores of the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised were positively associated with increased gray matter volumes in the right angular gyrus. Increased rather than decreased gray matter volume, especially involving the angular gyrus and prefrontal cortex may be the core pathophysiology in the early course of ASD.", "Chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS) is a neurogenetic disorder that is associated with a 25-fold increase in schizophrenia. Both individuals with 22q11.2DS and those with schizophrenia present with social cognitive deficits, which are putatively subserved by a network of brain regions that are involved in the processing of social cognitive information. This study used two-tensor tractography to examine the white matter tracts believed to underlie the social brain network in a group of 57 young adults with 22q11.2DS compared to 30 unaffected controls.\nResults indicated that relative to controls, participants with 22q11.2DS showed significant differences in several DTI metrics within the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, cingulum bundle, thalamo-frontal tract, and inferior longitudinal fasciculus. In addition, participants with 22q11.2DS showed significant differences in scores on measures of social cognition, including the Social Responsiveness Scale and Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire. Further analyses among individuals with 22q11.2DS demonstrated an association between DTI metrics and positive and negative symptoms of psychosis, as well as differentiation between individuals with 22q11.2DS and overt psychosis, relative to those with positive prodromal symptoms or no psychosis.\nFindings suggest that white matter disruption, specifically disrupted axonal coherence in the right inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, may be a biomarker for social cognitive difficulties and psychosis in individuals with 22q11.2DS.", "Sensory, in particular visual processing is recognized as often perturbed in individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). However, in terms of the literature pertaining to visual processing, individuals in the normal intelligence range (IQ = 90-110) and above, are more frequently represented in study samples than individuals who score below normal in the borderline intellectual disability (ID) (IQ = 71-85) to ID (IQ < 70) ranges. This raises concerns as to whether or not current research is generalizable to a disorder that is often co-morbid with ID. Thus, the aim of this review is to better understand to what extent the current ASD visual processing literature is representative of the entire ASD population as either diagnosed or recognized under DSM-5. Our recalculation of ASD prevalence figures, using the criteria of DSM-5, indicates approximately 40% of the ASD population are likely to be ID although searching of the visual processing literature in ASD up to July 2016 showed that only 20% of papers included the ASD with-ID population. In the published literature, the mean IQ sampled was found to be 104, with about 80% of studies sampling from the 96-115 of the IQ range, highlighting the marked under-representation of the ID and borderline ID sections of the ASD population. We conclude that current understanding of visual processing and perception in ASD is not based on the mean IQ profile of the DSM-5 defined ASD population that now appears to lie within the borderline ID to ID range. Give the importance of the role of vision for the social and cognitive processing in ASD, we recommend accurately representing ASD via greater inclusion of individuals with IQ below 80, in future ASD research.", "Neocortical gamma activity is crucial for sensory perception and cognition. This study examines the value of using non-task stimulation-induced EEG oscillations to predict cognitive status in a birth cohort of healthy Danish males (Metropolit) with varying cognitive ability. In particular, we examine the steady-state VEP power response (SSVEP-PR) in the alpha (8Hz) and gamma (36Hz) bands in 54 males (avg. age: 62.0 years) and compare these with 10 young healthy participants (avg. age 27.6 years). Furthermore, we correlate the individual alpha-to-gamma difference in relative visual-area power (\u0394RV) with cognitive scores for the older adults. We find that \u0394RV decrease with age by just over one standard deviation when comparing young with old participants (p<0.01). Furthermore, intelligence is significantly negatively correlated with \u0394RV in the older adult cohort, even when processing speed, global cognition, executive function, memory, and education (p<0.05). In our preferred specification, an increase in \u0394RV of one standard deviation is associated with a reduction in intelligence of 48% of a standard deviation (p<0.01). Finally, we conclude that the difference in cerebral rhythmic activity between the alpha and gamma bands is associated with age and cognitive status, and that \u0394RV therefore provide a non-subjective clinical tool with which to examine cognitive status in old age.", "Few studies on the relations between sleep quantity and/or quality and cognition have been conducted among preschoolers from healthy general population. We aimed at identifying, among 36 months old children, early factors associated with intelligence quotient (IQ) estimated through the Weschler Preschool and Primary Scale Intelligence-III test and its indicators: Full-Scale-, Verbal- and Performance-IQs and their subscale scores.\nWe included 194 children from the French birth cohort AuBE with both available Weschler Preschool and Primary Scale Intelligence-III scores at three years and sleep data. Information was collected through self-questionnaires at birth, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months. A day/night sleep ratio was calculated.\nMean scores were in normal ranges for Verbal, Performance, and Full-Scale IQs ?. In multivariate models, being a third-born or more child and watching television \u22651\u00a0h/day at 24 months were negatively associated with all IQ scores, whereas collective care arrangement was positively associated. Night waking at six months and frequent snoring at 18 months were negatively associated with Performance IQ, some subscales, and Full Scale IQ contrary to day/night sleep ratio at 12 months. No association was observed between early sleep characteristics and Verbal IQ.\nWe showed that early features including infant sleep characteristics influence IQ scores at 36 months old. Some of these may be accessible to prevention.", "From a differential perspective it is essential to identify high intellectual capacity (HIC) as a valuable personal and social resource. A valid, stable and reliable metric approach is needed that prevents both false positives and non-detection, thus facilitating the planning and implementation of educational intervention programmes that enable the individual to express his or her personal well-being and potential.\nTo explore the reliability and stability of the metric approach to HIC at different times of measurement.\nThe study examined a sample of 58 children with HIC, aged 8-14 years, who attended an extra-curricular enrichment programme. A multidimensional intellectual measure was administered at two points in time with an interval of one year (T1 and T2), by means of the differential and general aptitudes battery or the differential aptitudes test (according to the age), and the Torrance test of creative thinking. Calculations were performed to determine whether there were any statistically significant differences between the scores obtained by each participant at T1 and T2. An intra-individual regression analysis was also performed to establish the meaning of the significant differences obtained.\nThere were significant differences between the T1-T2 measurements in 25 of the profiles studied. Of these, the regression analysis indicated that there were five with instability between the T1 and T2 measures, which implies a change in intellectual profile.\nWe discuss the importance of ensuring the stability and reliability of the psychological measure, and the role of the intelligence quotient to increase the efficacy of the diagnosis of HIC, given its repercussion in educational adaptation, the expression of potentiality and the patient's personal well-being.\nFiabilidad y estabilidad en el diagnostico de la alta capacidad intelectual.\nIntroduccion. Desde una perspectiva diferencial, es esencial identificar la alta capacidad intelectual (ACI) como recurso de valor personal y social. Es necesaria una aproximacion metrica valida, estable y fiable que evite tanto los falsos positivos como su no deteccion, facilitando la planificacion e implementacion de programas de intervencion educativa que permitan la expresion del potencial y bienestar personal. Objetivo. Explorar la fiabilidad y estabilidad de la aproximacion metrica a la ACI en distintos momentos de medida. Sujetos y metodos. Se estudian 58 ni\u00f1os con ACI, de 8-14 a\u00f1os, asistentes a un programa de enriquecimiento extracurricular. Se administra una medida intelectual multidimensional, en dos puntos temporales con un intervalo de un a\u00f1o (T1 y T2), mediante la bateria de aptitudes diferenciales y generales o el test de aptitudes diferenciales (segun la edad), y el test de pensamiento creativo de Torrance. Se calcula si hay diferencias estadisticamente significativas entre las puntuaciones obtenidas por cada participante en T1 y T2, y se realiza un analisis de regresion intraindividual para conocer el significado de las diferencias significativas obtenidas. Resultados. Hay diferencias significativas en 25 de los perfiles estudiados entre las medidas T1-T2, de los cuales el analisis de regresion indica que hay cinco con inestabilidad entre las medidas T1 y T2, lo que implica un cambio de perfil intelectual. Conclusion. Se reflexiona sobre la importancia de asegurar la estabilidad y fiabilidad de la medida psicologica y el papel del cociente de inteligencia para aumentar la eficacia del diagnostico de la ACI, dada su repercusion en el ajuste educativo, la expresion de la potencialidad y el bienestar personal.", "According to the 2015 Quality of Death Index published by the Intelligence Unit of the Economist, Hong Kong is ranked 22nd in terms of quality of palliative care in the world, behind many other major developed countries in Asia, including Taiwan, Singapore, Japan, and South Korea. The objectives of the present study were to describe the knowledge, attitude, and preferences of the general Hong Kong adult population across different age groups regarding end-of-life (EOL) care decisions, place of care and death, as well as advance directive (AD).\nThis was a population-based cross-sectional survey conducted by telephone. A total of 1067 adults over 30\u00a0years old were contacted through residential telephone lines using a random sampling method and were interviewed. Information on sociodemographic factors, general health status, chronic diseases, knowledge, attitude and preferences of advance decisions, EOL care, and place of death were collected.\nA total of 85.7% had not heard of AD, but 60.9% would prefer to make their own AD if legislated after explanation; and for those who did not prefer to have an AD, the predominant concern was the possible change of mind afterward. Adjusted logistic regression suggested that female participants were less willing to make an AD, whereas those with prior knowledge of do-not-attempt-cardiopulmonary-resuscitation significantly increased the chance of making an AD. In terms of life-sustaining treatments, a predominant 87.6% preferred to receive appropriate palliative care that gives comfort rather than to prolong life if being diagnosed to be terminally ill; 43% disagreed that doctors should generally try to keep patients alive for as long as possible; and 86.2% agreed that the patient's own wishes should determine what treatment he/she should receive. Adjusted logistic regression showed that palliative care was more preferred by age groups 50\u00a0years or above but was less preferred by those who did not care for their family members with chronic diseases. Regarding place of death, 31.2% of the participants would choose to die at home, and among those, 19.5% would still prefer to die at home even if they did not have sufficient support. Adjusted logistic regression showed a decreased trend for all older age groups from 40-49\u00a0years to 80+\u00a0years, as well as having poor self-rated health, to prefer to die at home. Being a female participant and having education level of tertiary or above, however, had higher preference for death at home.\nThis is the first population-representative survey of the general Hong Kong adult population on the knowledge, attitude, and preferences of AD, EOL care, and place of care/death. The main implication of this study was that preferences to have autonomy over own EOL care, to receive palliative care, and to die at home were greater than the actual practice currently, highlighting the service gaps for better EOL care in the future.", "Artificial intelligence has seen several breakthroughs in recent years, with games often serving as milestones. A common feature of these games is that players have perfect information. Poker, the quintessential game of imperfect information, is a long-standing challenge problem in artificial intelligence. We introduce DeepStack, an algorithm for imperfect-information settings. It combines recursive reasoning to handle information asymmetry, decomposition to focus computation on the relevant decision, and a form of intuition that is automatically learned from self-play using deep learning. In a study involving 44,000 hands of poker, DeepStack defeated, with statistical significance, professional poker players in heads-up no-limit Texas hold'em. The approach is theoretically sound and is shown to produce strategies that are more difficult to exploit than prior approaches.", "In children, acute global brain injury from traumatic brain injury (TBI) and nontraumatic coma has a substantial cost to the child, the family, and the society. There have historically been relatively few studies looking at long-term cognition and behavioural outcomes.\nLong-term follow-up studies, population-based studies, and meta-analyses are now available for TBI in children as well as adults and suggest that there is a significant cognitive cost, particularly for processing speed, working memory, and intelligence quotient (IQ) in severe TBI. Poor attention is often a premorbid deficit. Children surviving a cardiac arrest typically have a reduction in IQ. The available data for meningitis suggest that IQ is within the normal range at follow-up in most but is lower than that of matched controls. For encephalitis, the main advances have been in the recognition of additional mechanisms for postinfectious causes, including autoimmune disorders and demyelination. MRI assists with diagnosis, particularly in infectious causes, and there is some evidence that it may be useful for prognosis, particularly in TBI.\nFor the essential randomized control trials of acute treatment and rehabilitation, cognitive or MRI endpoints may become feasible as otherwise the time frame for follow-up is too long for the implementation of change.", "The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between emotional intelligence and job satisfaction among nurses in Accra, Ghana.\nA correlational study was conducted in Ghana in 2015. The study conveniently sampled 120 registered general nurses (83 females and 37 males) from three public hospitals located in Accra. The Schutte Self-Report Emotional Intelligence Inventory and the Job Satisfaction Survey were used to assess emotional intelligence and job satisfaction respectively.\nThe findings showed a significant positive correlation between emotional intelligence and job satisfaction among the nurses. However, the results revealed no significant gender difference in emotional intelligence and job satisfaction.", "Citation and coauthor networks offer an insight into the dynamics of scientific progress. We can also view them as representations of a causal structure, a logical process captured in a graph. From a causal perspective, we can ask questions such as whether authors form groups primarily due to their prior shared interest, or if their favourite topics are 'contagious' and spread through co-authorship. Such networks have been widely studied by the artificial intelligence community, and recently a connection has been made to nonlocal correlations produced by entangled particles in quantum physics-the impact of latent hidden variables can be analyzed by the same algebraic geometric methodology that relies on a sequence of semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxations. Following this trail, we treat our sample coauthor network as a causal graph and, using SDP relaxations, rule out latent homophily as a manifestation of prior shared interest only, leading to the observed patternedness. By introducing algebraic geometry to citation studies, we add a new tool to existing methods for the analysis of content-related social influences.", "To determine: (1) if childhood cognitive and academic abilities mediate the association between being born at extremely low birth weight (ELBW) and socioeconomic attainment at age 29 to 36 years; (2) which cognitive abilities (IQ, verbal abilities, fluid intelligence, mathematical abilities, or academic achievement) most strongly mediate this association; and (3) if the mediating role of cognition is different in ELBW survivors with significant neurosensory impairment (NSI).\nA prospective, longitudinal cohort of 100 Canadian ELBW survivors born between 1977 and 1982 and 89 normal birth weight comparison participants were used to examine the mediating role of childhood cognition by using 5 cognitive mediators assessed at age 8 years (overall IQ, verbal IQ, performance IQ, quantitative ability, and academic achievement) on socioeconomic attainment at adulthood. Socioeconomic attainment was defined as personal annual earnings and full-time employment assessed via self-report at age 29 to 36 years.\nMediation models revealed that childhood cognition mediated the association between ELBW status and income attainment, with mathematical abilities and overall IQ each accounting for 26% of the direct effect. Mediated effects were not statistically significant in full-time employment models. For both outcomes, the mediating effect of cognition was stronger for ELBW survivors with NSI.\nChildhood cognitive abilities partially mediate associations between ELBW status and adult income attainment. Early life cognition is a critical predictor of socioeconomic attainment in ELBW survivors, particularly in those born with NSI. Interventions aimed at enhancing early cognition in ELBW survivors may help optimize their later socioeconomic attainment.", "The purposes of this study are to determine the level of emotional intelligence (EI) among nurse managers (NMs) in an academic medical center and determine the relationship of EI and demographic variables.\nEmotional intelligence is a concept that warrants further research in nursing because there is a huge gap in knowledge about nurse leaders' EI.\nData were collected from 38 NMs recruited from a large academic medical center in the Northeast.\nMean EI scores among NMs were average. Nurse managers with less than 2 years of experience had statistically significant lower \"using emotions\" branch score and strategic EI. Nurse managers with a masters' degree in nursing scored significantly higher in using emotions branch score than did those with a masters' degree in a related field.\nOpportunities exist to enhance the EI of NMs.", "The purpose of this comment is to put the Process Overlap Theory of Kovacs and Conway in the broadest possible context. I will briefly discuss the nature of intelligence testing and then relate it to the theory under consideration before making a few concluding comments.", "The aim of the present study was to evaluate the relationship of drinking water fluoride levels with children's intelligence quotient (IQ).\nWater was collected from initially identified endemic fluoride regions according to the geological research of Government of India. Fluoride concentration of the water was assessed by utilizing fluoride ion selective electrode, Orion 9609BN, and categorized on the basis of fluoride concentration into low, medium, and high-fluoride regions, i.e., Virajpet (low fluoride level < 1.2 ppm), Banavara (Medium fluoride level 1.2-2 ppm), and Mastihalli (High fluoride levels > 3 ppm). Government school from all three villages were selected randomly and IQ levels were assessed by using Raven's Standard Progressive Matrices. This test was conducted on each child in the study sample.\nA significant inverse relationship was found between the fluoride concentration in drinking water and IQ (r value = -0.204; P < 0.000). It was observed that IQ level was negatively correlated with fluoride concentration in drinking water.\nIt is concluded that IQ level was negatively correlated with fluoride level in drinking water. Factors that might affect children's IQ need to be considered, and it is necessary to devise solutions for preventing the harmful effects of excessive intake of fluoride ion to the body.", "Acoustic temporal envelope (E) cues containing speech information are distributed across the frequency spectrum. To investigate the relative weight of E cues in different frequency regions for Mandarin sentence recognition, E information was extracted from 30 contiguous bands across the range of 80-7,562\u2009Hz using Hilbert decomposition and then allocated to five frequency regions. Recognition scores were obtained with acoustic E cues from 1 or 2 random regions from 40 normal-hearing listeners. While the recognition scores ranged from 8.2% to 16.3% when E information from only one region was available, the scores ranged from 57.9% to 87.7% when E information from two frequency regions was presented, suggesting a synergistic effect among the temporal E cues in different frequency regions. Next, the relative contributions of the E information from the five frequency regions to sentence perception were computed using a least-squares approach. The results demonstrated that, for Mandarin Chinese, a tonal language, the temporal E cues of Frequency Region 1 (80-502\u2009Hz) and Region 3 (1,022-1,913\u2009Hz) contributed more to the intelligence of sentence recognition than other regions, particularly the region of 80-502\u2009Hz, which contained fundamental frequency (F0) information.", "Methylmercury (MeHg) is a known developmental neurotoxicant present in fish, yet the impact of childhood exposure is uncertain, especially in children with poor nutrition.\nTo evaluate associations of MeHg exposure with cognitive abilities and behavior in children from a poor rural area in Bangladesh.\nThe MeHg exposure was assessed in 1434 ten-year-old children by measuring mercury concentrations in hair (hair-Hg), using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Cognitive abilities were assessed with the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (4th edition), and behavior by the parent-report Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire.\nChildren's median hair-Hg was 674\u03bcg/kg (range 70-17,561\u03bcg/kg). Concentrations did not differ by distance from scalp, indicating a similar exposure over time. No multivariable-adjusted associations were observed between the children's hair-Hg and their cognitive abilities. However, children in the highest tertile of hair-Hg had a lower prevalence of hyperactivity (OR: 0.61, 95% CI: 0.45-0.83) and peer relationship problems (OR: 0.58, 95% CI: 0.44-0.76), compared to children in the lowest tertile. The corresponding ORs were slightly stronger in children from families with lower socioeconomic status (OR: 0.56, 95% CI: 0.34-0.90 and OR: 0.48, 95% CI: 0.30-0.74) than in children from families with higher socioeconomic status (OR: 0.73, 95% CI: 0.49-1.08 and OR: 0.72, 95% CI: 0.51-1.02). Similar stronger ORs were observed in underweight children.\nMeHg exposure was not associated with cognitive function, but inversely associated with certain adverse behavior. More studies are needed concerning the risk-benefit of different fish consumption in rural Bangladesh.", "Follow-up observation is required for mild-to-moderate hydrocephalic patients because of the potential damage to brain. However, effects of mild-to-moderate hydrocephalus on gray and white matter remain unclear in vivo. Using structural MRI and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), current study compared the cortical thickness and white matter integrity between children with mild-to-moderate communicating hydrocephalus and healthy controls. The relationships between cortical changes and intelligence quota were also examined in patients. We found that cortical thickness in the left middle temporal and left rostral middle frontal gyrus was significantly lower in the hydrocephalus group compared with that of controls. Fractional anisotropy in the right corpus callosum body was significantly lower in the hydrocephalus group compared with that of controls. In addition, there was no association of cortical thinning or white matter fractional anisotropy with intelligence quota in either group. Thus, our findings provide clues to that mild-to-moderate hydrocephalus could lead to structural brain deficits especially in the middle temporal and middle frontal gyrus prior to the behavior changes.", "In efforts to develop reliable methods to detect the likelihood of impending suicidal behaviors, we have proposed the following.\nTo gain a deeper understanding of the state of suicide risk by determining the combination of variables that distinguishes between groups with and without suicide risk.\nA study involving 707 patients consulting for mental health issues in three health centers in Greater Santiago, Chile. Using 345 variables, an analysis was carried out with artificial intelligence tools, Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining processes, and decision tree techniques. The basic algorithm was top-down, and the most suitable division produced by the tree was selected by using the lowest Gini index as a criterion and by looping it until the condition of belonging to the group with suicidal behavior was fulfilled.\nFour trees distinguishing the groups were obtained, of which the elements of one were analyzed in greater detail, since this tree included both clinical and personality variables. This specific tree consists of six nodes without suicide risk and eight nodes with suicide risk (tree decision 01, accuracy 0.674, precision 0.652, recall 0.678, specificity 0.670, F measure 0.665, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) area under the curve (AUC) 73.35%; tree decision 02, accuracy 0.669, precision 0.642, recall 0.694, specificity 0.647, F measure 0.667, ROC AUC 68.91%; tree decision 03, accuracy 0.681, precision 0.675, recall 0.638, specificity 0.721, F measure, 0.656, ROC AUC 65.86%; tree decision 04, accuracy 0.714, precision 0.734, recall 0.628, specificity 0.792, F measure 0.677, ROC AUC 58.85%).\nThis study defines the interactions among a group of variables associated with suicidal ideation and behavior. By using these variables, it may be possible to create a quick and easy-to-use tool. As such, psychotherapeutic interventions could be designed to mitigate the impact of these variables on the emotional state of individuals, thereby reducing eventual risk of suicide. Such interventions may reinforce psychological well-being, feelings of self-worth, and reasons for living, for each individual in certain groups of patients.", "To introduce the Canadian Network for Public Health Intelligence's new Knowledge Integration using Web-based Intelligence (KIWI) technology, and to pefrom preliminary evaluation of the KIWI technology using a case study. The purpose of this new technology is to support surveillance activities by monitoring unstructured data sources for the early detection and awareness of potential public health threats.\nA prototype of the KIWI technology, adapted for zoonotic and emerging diseases, was piloted by end-users with expertise in the field of public health and zoonotic/emerging disease surveillance. The technology was assessed using variables such as geographic coverage, user participation, and others; categorized by high-level attributes from evaluation guidelines for internet based surveillance systems. Special attention was given to the evaluation of the system's automated sense-making algorithm, which used variables such as sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values. Event-based surveillance evaluation was not applied to its full capacity as such an evaluation is beyond the scope of this paper.\nKIWI was piloted with user participation = 85.0% and geographic coverage within monitored sources = 83.9% of countries. The pilots, which focused on zoonotic and emerging diseases, lasted a combined total of 65 days and resulted in the collection of 3243 individual information pieces (IIP) and 2 community reported events (CRE) for processing. Ten sources were monitored during the second phase of the pilot, which resulted in 545 anticipatory intelligence signals (AIS). KIWI's automated sense-making algorithm (SMA) had sensitivity = 63.9% (95% CI: 60.2-67.5%), specificity = 88.6% (95% CI: 87.3-89.8%), positive predictive value = 59.8% (95% CI: 56.1-63.4%), and negative predictive value = 90.3% (95% CI: 89.0-91.4%).\nLiterature suggests the need for internet based monitoring and surveillance systems that are customizable, integrated into collaborative networks of public health professionals, and incorporated into national surveillance activities. Results show that the KIWI technology is well posied to address some of the suggested challenges. A limitation of this study is that sample size for pilot participation was small for capturing overall readiness of integrating KIWI into regular surveillance activities.\nKIWI is a customizable technology developed within an already thriving collaborative platform used by public health professionals, and performs well as a tool for discipline-specific event monitoring and early warning signal detection.", "To examine emotion processing in euthymic bipolar patients (EBP) compared to healthy controls. In addition, to determine whether or not there is an association between emotion processing and psychosocial functioning.\nA sample of 60 EBP and 60 healthy controls matched for age, gender, education level, and premorbid intelligence were studied. All subjects were assessed using the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB) and two additional executive function measures: the Trail Making Test-Part B and the Stroop Test. Emotion processing was examined using the Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test (MSCEIT). Psychosocial functioning was assessed using the Functional Assessment Short Test (FAST).\nEuthymic bipolar patients obtained lower scores than controls in all MSCEIT measures except for the using emotions branch. Likewise, EBP obtained a worse performance than healthy controls in all neurocognitive domains. Correlation between MSCEIT strategic area measures and FAST total score was found (r = -0.311; P < 0.016). Regression analysis showed that residual depressive symptomatology explains a 9.1% of the variance in functional outcome. MSCEIT strategic area score explained an additional 8.6%. Neurocognition did not increase the percentage of the variance explained by emotion processing.\nEuthymic bipolar patients exhibit deficits in emotion processing. Emotion processing is associated with social functioning in these patients.", "A series of papers showing that measures of general cognitive ability predicted performance on the job and in training and that measures of specific cognitive abilities rarely made an incremental contribution to prediction led to a premature decline in research on the roles of specific abilities in the workplace. Lessons learned from this research include the importance of choosing the right general cognitive measures and variables, the relative roles of prediction vs. understanding and the need for a wide range of criteria when evaluating the contribution of specific skills such as complex problem solving. In particular, research published since the \"not much more than g\" era suggests that distinguishing between fluid and crystallized intelligence is important for understanding the development and the contribution of complex problem solving.", "Childhood trauma is a risk factor for schizophrenia that affects brain functions associated with higher cognitive processes, including social cognition. Alterations in Theory-of-Mind (ToM), or mentalizing skills, are a hallmark feature of schizophrenia, and are also evident in individuals exposed to childhood trauma. However, the impact of childhood trauma exposure on brain function during social cognition in schizophrenia remains unclear. We thus examined the association between childhood trauma and brain function during the performance of a ToM task in 47 patients diagnosed with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. All participants completed the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) and underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging while performing an established visual-cartoon affective ToM task. Whole-brain multiple regression analysis was performed on ToM-related brain activation, with CTQ total score as regressor of interest, while accounting for the effects of age, sex, diagnosis, symptom severity, behavioural performance, intelligence and medications levels. First, using a small-volume correction approach within a mask made of key regions for ToM [including bilateral temporo-parietal junctions (TPJ), medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC)/precuneus], total CTQ scores were positively associated with activation of the PCC/precuneus. Second, exploratory analyses for the rest of the brain (i.e., ROIs masked-out), revealed a positive association between trauma exposure and activation of the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC), and a negative association with activation of the anterior section of the TPJ. These results suggest that childhood trauma exposure may, at least partially, contribute to functional alterations of brain regions essential for effective mental state inference in schizophrenia.", "We investigated possible pathways into mental illness via the combined effects of trait emotional intelligence (trait EI), mindfulness, and irrational beliefs. The sample comprised 121 psychiatric outpatients (64.5% males, mean age\u00a0=\u00a038.8\u00a0years) with a variety of formal clinical diagnoses. Psychopathology was operationalized by means of 3 distinct indicators from the Millon Clinical Multi-Axial Inventory (mild pathology, severe pathology, and clinical symptomatology). A structural equation model confirmed significant direct trait EI and mindfulness effects on irrational beliefs and psychopathology. Trait EI also had a significant indirect effect on psychopathology via mindfulness. Together, the 3 constructs accounted for 44% of the variance in psychopathology. A series of hierarchical regressions demonstrated that trait EI is a stronger predictor of psychopathology than mindfulness and irrational beliefs combined. We conclude that the identified pathways can provide the basis for the development of safe and effective responses to the ongoing mental health and overmedication crises.\nSelf-perception constructs concerning one's beliefs about oneself have a major impact on the likelihood of developing psychopathological symptoms. Emotional perceptions captured by trait emotional intelligence were stronger predictors of psychopathology than either or both mindfulness and irrational beliefs in a clinical sample of adults. If the seed factors of psychopathology are mainly psychological, rather than mainly biological, and given that psychological constructs, like trait emotional intelligence, mindfulness, and irrational beliefs, are amenable to training and optimization, the findings herein provide the impetus for a much needed shift of emphasis from pharmacological to psychological treatments.", "The importance of emotional intelligence (EI) in the successful practice of medicine has been well established. However, efforts to study the same in India, especially in doctors and medical students, are lacking. This study has measured the emotional intelligence of postgraduate medical students in Delhi and aimed to identify some of the factors affecting it.\nA cross-sectional analytical study, using the Schutte's Self-Report Emotional Intelligence Test, to measure the EI of 200 postgraduate medical students\u00a0of two medical colleges in Delhi. Students working in clinical specialties were selected randomly\u00a0and contacted by the first author. Data was collected by a self-administered questionnaire.\nThe mean scores of EI among the study participants was 124.4 with a standard deviation of 12.8. The total scores possible in the scale range from 33 to 165, with higher scores representing higher EI. The age of the participants was positively associated with emotional intelligence (r = 0.187, p = 0.008). EI was also found to decrease with the increase in total workload (p=0.013), having night duty hours (p = 0.019), and having emergency duty (p = 0.037). \u00a0 Conclusions: More studies to measure the EI of doctors, the factors affecting it, and possible measures to improve it, are needed. The workload of the resident doctors needs to be assessed\u00a0with appropriate changes made in the total work done and the quality of work done.", "This study set out to improve our understanding of potential pedagogical factors that may influence the mental health of veterinary students. Previous research has demonstrated that the type of feedback given to children by parents and teachers can strongly influence young people's beliefs in their ability to modify their intelligence-their \"mindset.\" There is also evidence that we can change the mindset of students relating to their intelligence by changing the methods by which we teach and assess. We used a paper-based questionnaire to assess mindset and psychological well-being in veterinary students (n=148). We found an association linking students' mindset to their intelligence and their psychological well-being. Students who believed that their level of intelligence was fixed had significantly lower scores on five out of six areas of psychological well-being compared to students who believed that their intelligence was malleable. Giving process rather than person feedback and reducing assessment methods that encourage comparison with other students could increase the proportion of our students with a growth mindset and, if the association we identified is causal, improve their psychological well-being.", "This paper discusses the importance of three features of psychometric tests for cognition research: construct definition, problem space, and knowledge domain. Definition of constructs, e.g., intelligence or creativity, forms the theoretical basis for test construction. Problem space, being well or ill-defined, is determined by the cognitive abilities considered to belong to the constructs, e.g., convergent thinking to intelligence, divergent thinking to creativity. Knowledge domain and the possibilities it offers cognition are reflected in test results. We argue that (a) comparing results of tests with different problem spaces is more informative when cognition operates in both tests on an identical knowledge domain, and (b) intertwining of abilities related to both constructs can only be expected in tests developed to instigate such a process. Test features should guarantee that abilities can contribute to self-generated and goal-directed processes bringing forth solutions that are both new and applicable. We propose and discuss a test example that was developed to address these issues.", "The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) on the early intellectual development of preterm infants.\nFrom 2011 to 2015, 83 preterm infants diagnosed with BPD were recruited to the BPD group, and 89 preterm infants without BPD and 98 healthy term infants were randomly recruited to the non-BPD and term group, respectively. Neural and intellectual development according to the Gesell Development Scale were evaluated and compared between groups at 0-3 months, 3-6 months, 6-9 months, and 9-12 months of adjusted age for preterm infants and real age for term infants. Multivariate logistic regression was used to determine the associations between BPD and adverse neurological outcomes at 9-12 months of adjusted age.\nCompared with term infants, preterm infants had significantly lower developmental quotients for adaptability, gross motor, fine motor, language and social skills. At follow up, deficits in one or more neurofunctions related to adaptability, gross motor, fine motor, language and social skills were significantly more frequent in preterm children with BPD than in those with no history of BPD. BPD was independently associated with adverse neurological outcome at 9-12 months of adjusted age in preterm infants.\nEarly intelligence disturbances occurred significantly more frequently in BPD infants than in non-BPD infants. Monitoring of the development of the nervous system in BPD infants should be strengthened.", "Studies in child and adolescent offspring of patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorders may help understand the influence of neurodevelopmental factors on the premorbid phenotype of these disorders.\nTo assess whether a combination of neurodevelopmental factors discriminates between young offspring of patients with schizophrenia (SzO) or bipolar disorder (BpO) and community controls (CcO). To assess the association between these factors and rates of psychiatric diagnoses in high risk (HR) youth.\nOne hundred thirty-three HR offspring (47 SzO and 86 BpO) and 84 CcO, aged 6-17, underwent cross-sectional clinical, neurocognitive, and structural neuroimaging assessment. Information on perinatal events and early childhood development was also obtained. General linear mixed models were performed to assess group discrimination and association with lifetime axis I psychiatric disorders.\nMultivariate analyses revealed that greater neurological soft signs (NSS), less total grey matter volume (GMV) and a higher frequency of obstetric complications discriminated HR offspring from CcO. When comparing each group individually, greater NSS and a higher frequency of obstetric complications discriminated SzO from CcO, and BpO from CcO, while lower intelligence also discriminated SzO from CcO and from BpO. Within HR offspring, lower intelligence and less total GMV were associated with lifetime incidence of psychiatric disorders.\nBoth SzO and BpO showed evidence of neurodevelopmental insult, although this may have a greater impact in SzO. Lower intelligence and less total GMV hold potential as biomarkers of risk for psychiatric disorders in HR youth.", "Koolen-de Vries Syndrome (KdVS), also referred to as 17q21.31 microdeletion syndrome, is caused by haploinsufficiency of the KANSL1 gene. This genetic disorder is associated with a clinical phenotype including facial dysmorphism, developmental delay, and friendly disposition, as well as mild-to-moderate intellectual disability. We present the case of a 10 year 8 month old female with KdVS due to a de novo intragenic KANSL1 mutation. At this time, she does not present with intellectual disability, and her verbal intelligence is relatively preserved, although she has perceptual deficits, developmental dyspraxia, and severe speech disorder. This case expands the mild end of the neurodevelopmental spectrum seen in children with de novo KANSL1 mutation and KdVS. \u00a9 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.", "Regarding the importance of health care providers such as nurses who are always in stressful environments, it is imperative to better understand how they become more engaged in their work. The purpose of this paper is to focus on health care providers (nurses), and examine how the interaction between spiritual intelligence and psychological empowerment affect job engagement.\nThis descriptive and quantitative study was conducted among nurses at the Faghihi Hospital in Shiraz, Iran in 2010. A sample of nurses (n = 179) completed standard survey questionnaire including spiritual intelligence, psychological empowerment, and job engagement which included 5 questions for each dimensions. For testing the hypotheses of the study, results were analyzed through structural equation modeling (SEM) using LISREL 8.8.\nSEM revealed that psychological empowerment could fully mediate the relationship between spiritual intelligence and job engagement. However, the correlation between spiritual intelligence and job engagement was significant but weak using Pearson coefficient method. This can imply that psychological empowerment plays a crucial role in the relationship between spiritual intelligence and job engagement.\nThis paper indicates that spiritual intelligence might affect different organizational parameters, directly or indirectly. Therefore, it is recommended that the researchers evaluate probable relationships between spiritual intelligence and other variables.", "Studies of executive function and its relationship with brain T2-weighted hyperintensities in children with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) have yielded inconsistent results. We examined 16 children with NF1 aged 8 to 15 years, of normal intelligence, and compared their findings to those of 16 siblings and 16 typically developing children using the Behavioural Assessment of the Dysexecutive Syndrome in Children (BADS-C). NF1 patients had an adequate overall score at BADS-C, but showed significantly lower performance than typical peers in the Key Search subtest. This is a task that must be solved without any given rules, in which subjects must devise a strategy and an efficient search pattern transferable to other similar real situations. The Key Search scores were not correlated with number and signal characteristics of T2-weighted hyperintensities. Planning without external indications is impaired in children with NF1 because they have to rely entirely on self-organization and monitoring; this study provides information for remediation programs designed to improve functioning in daily life.", "Object detection and classification have countless applications in human-robot interacting systems. It is a necessary skill for autonomous robots that perform tasks in household scenarios. Despite the great advances in deep learning and computer vision, social robots performing non-trivial tasks usually spend most of their time finding and modeling objects. Working in real scenarios means dealing with constant environment changes and relatively low-quality sensor data due to the distance at which objects are often found. Ambient intelligence systems equipped with different sensors can also benefit from the ability to find objects, enabling them to inform humans about their location. For these applications to succeed, systems need to detect the objects that may potentially contain other objects, working with relatively low-resolution sensor data. A passive learning architecture for sensors has been designed in order to take advantage of multimodal information, obtained using an RGB-D camera and trained semantic language models. The main contribution of the architecture lies in the improvement of the performance of the sensor under conditions of low resolution and high light variations using a combination of image labeling and word semantics. The tests performed on each of the stages of the architecture compare this solution with current research labeling techniques for the application of an autonomous social robot working in an apartment. The results obtained demonstrate that the proposed sensor architecture outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.", "Gene selection is a demanding task for microarray data analysis. The diverse complexity of different cancers makes this issue still challenging. In this study, a novel evolutionary method based on genetic algorithms and artificial intelligence is proposed to identify predictive genes for cancer classification. A filter method was first applied to reduce the dimensionality of feature space followed by employing an integer-coded genetic algorithm with dynamic-length genotype, intelligent parameter settings, and modified operators. The algorithmic behaviors including convergence trends, mutation and crossover rate changes, and running time were studied, conceptually discussed, and shown to be coherent with literature findings. Two well-known filter methods, Laplacian and Fisher score, were examined considering similarities, the quality of selected genes, and their influences on the evolutionary approach. Several statistical tests concerning choice of classifier, choice of dataset, and choice of filter method were performed, and they revealed some significant differences between the performance of different classifiers and filter methods over datasets. The proposed method was benchmarked upon five popular high-dimensional cancer datasets; for each, top explored genes were reported. Comparing the experimental results with several state-of-the-art methods revealed that the proposed method outperforms previous methods in DLBCL dataset.", "Individuals with a growth mindset believe that all failures are opportunities and that their baseline intelligence and talent can be used for continuous improvement. Individuals with a fixed mindset believe that baseline intelligence and talent cannot be developed. A growth mindset is associated with greater academic success and greater resilience in the face of failure or stress. Second-year veterinary students completed three surveys to determine mindset, perceived levels of stress, and life change score. Of 57 students, 70% had a strong growth mindset or a growth mindset with some fixed ideas. No students had a strong fixed mindset. Mindset was not correlated with GPA or perceived stress level. Colleges of veterinary medicine can assist students by providing resources and training for stress management, including training in how to further develop a growth mindset.", "The human brain is the outcome of innumerable evolutionary processes; the systems genetics of psychiatric disorders could bear their signatures. On this basis, we analyzed five psychiatric disorders, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, and schizophrenia (SCZ), using GWAS summary statistics from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium. Machine learning-derived scores were used to investigate two natural-selection scenarios: complete selection (loci where a selected allele reached fixation) and incomplete selection (loci where a selected allele has not yet reached fixation). ASD GWAS results positively correlated with incomplete-selection (p = 3.53*10-4). Variants with ASD GWAS p<0.1 were shown to have a 19%-increased probability to be in the top-5% for incomplete-selection score (OR = 1.19, 95%CI = 1.11-1.8, p = 9.56*10-7). Investigating the effect directions of minor alleles, we observed an enrichment for positive associations in SNPs with ASD GWAS p<0.1 and top-5% incomplete-selection score (permutation p<10-4). Considering the set of these ASD-positive-associated variants, we observed gene-expression enrichments for brain and pituitary tissues (p = 2.3*10-5 and p = 3*10-5, respectively) and 53 gene ontology (GO) enrichments, such as nervous system development (GO:0007399, p = 7.57*10-12), synapse organization (GO:0050808, p = 8.29*10-7), and axon guidance (GO:0007411, p = 1.81*10-7). Previous genetic studies demonstrated that ASD positively correlates with childhood intelligence, college completion, and years of schooling. Accordingly, we hypothesize that certain ASD risk alleles were under positive selection during human evolution due to their involvement in neurogenesis and cognitive ability.", "During their early years at medical school, students repeatedly criticize their workload, time constraints and test associated stress. At the same time, depressiveness and anxiety among first and second year medical students are on the rise. We therefore hypothesized that test anxiety may be related to depressiveness and considered cognitive and academic performances as confounders for the former and psychosocial distress for the latter.\nA whole class of 200 second year students was invited to participate in the study. Anxiety as a trait, depressiveness, crystallized intelligence, verbal fluency and psychosocial distress were assessed using validated tests and questionnaires. Acute state anxiety and sympathetic stress parameters were measured in real life situations immediately before an oral and a written exam and paired tests were used to compare the individual anxieties at the various time points. Previous academic performances were self-reported, the results of the impending exams were monitored. Finally, correlations were performed to test for interrelatedness between academic performances and the various personal, cognitive and psychosocial factors.\nAcute test anxiety did not correlate with depressiveness nor did it correlate with previous nor impending academic performances nor any of the expected confounders on academic performance. However both, depressiveness and test anxiety strongly correlated with the perceived imbalance between efforts spent and rewards received. Moreover, anxiety as a trait not only correlated with acute state anxiety before an exam but was also significantly correlated to the feeling of over-commitment.\nDepressiveness during the early years of medical school seems unrelated to test anxiety and academic performance. Instead, it strongly correlated with the psychosocial distress emanating from attending medical school and points at a perceived imbalance between efforts spent and rewards received.", "Congenital muscular dystrophy (CMD) is a heterogeneous disease entity. The detailed clinical manifestation and causative gene for each subgroup of CMD are quite variable. This study aims to analyze the phenotypes and genotypes of Taiwanese patients with CMD as the epidemiology of CMD varies among populations and has been scantly described in Asia.\nA total of 48 patients suspected to have CMD were screened and categorized by histochemistry and immunohistochemistry studies. Different genetic analyses, including next-generation sequencing (NGS), were selected, based on the clinical and pathological findings.\nWe identified 17 patients with sarcolemma-specific collagen VI deficiency (SSCD), 6 patients with merosin deficiency, two with reduced alpha-dystroglycan staining, and two with striking lymphocyte infiltration in addition to dystrophic change on muscle pathology. Fourteen in 15 patients with SSCD, were shown to have COL6A1, COL6A2 or COL6A3 mutations by NGS analysis; all showed marked distal hyperlaxity and normal intelligence but the overall severity was less than in previously reported patients from other populations. All six patients with merosin deficiency had mutations in LAMA2. They showed relatively uniform phenotype that were compatible with previous studies, except for higher proportion of mental retardation with epilepsy. With reduced alpha-dystroglycan staining, one patient was found to carry mutations in POMT1 while another patient carried mutations in TRAPPC11. LMNA mutations were found in the two patients with inflammatory change on muscle pathology. They were clinically characterized by neck flexion limitation and early joint contracture, but no cardiac problem had developed yet.\nMuscle pathology remains helpful in guiding further molecular analyses by direct sequencing of certain genes or by target capture/NGS as a second-tier diagnostic tool, and is crucial for establishing the genotype-phenotype correlation. We also determined the frequencies of the different types of CMD in our cohort which is important for the development of a specific care system for each disease.", "Advances in machine intelligence have created powerful capabilities in algorithms that find hidden patterns in data, classify objects based on their measured characteristics, and associate similar patients/diseases/drugs based on common features. However, artificial intelligence (AI) applications in medical data have several technical challenges: complex and heterogeneous datasets, noisy medical datasets, and explaining their output to users. There are also social challenges related to intellectual property, data provenance, regulatory issues, economics, and liability.", "Physical capacity and coordination cannot alone predict success in team sports such as soccer. Instead, more focus has been directed towards the importance of cognitive abilities, and it has been suggested that executive functions (EF) are fundamentally important for success in soccer. However, executive functions are going through a steep development from adolescence to adulthood. Moreover, more complex EF involving manipulation of information (higher level EF) develop later than simple executive functions such as those linked to simple working memory capacity (Core EF). The link between EF and success in young soccer players is therefore not obvious. In the present study we investigated whether EF are associated with success in soccer in young elite soccer players. We performed tests measuring core EF (a demanding working memory task involving a variable n-back task; dWM) and higher level EF (Design Fluency test; DF). Color-Word Interference Test and Trail Making Test were performed on an exploratory level as they contain a linguistic element. The lower level EF test (dWM) was taken from CogStateSport computerized concussion testing and the higher level EF test (DF) was from Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System test battery (D-KEFS). In a group of young elite soccer players (n = 30; aged 12-19 years) we show that they perform better than the norm in both the dWM (+0.49 SD) and DF (+0.86 SD). Moreover, we could show that both dWM and DF correlate with the number of goals the players perform during the season. The effect was more prominent for dWM (r = 0.437) than for DF (r = 0.349), but strongest for a combined measurement (r = 0.550). The effect was still present when we controlled for intelligence, length and age in a partial correlation analysis. Thus, our study suggests that both core and higher level EF may predict success in soccer also in young players.", "In a longitudinal population-based study of 2,905 children, we investigated if infants' neuromotor development was associated with autistic traits in childhood. Overall motor development and muscle tone were examined by trained research assistants with an adapted version of Touwen's Neurodevelopmental Examination between ages 2 and 5 months. Tone was assessed in several positions and items were scored as normal, low, or high tone. Parents rated their children's autistic traits with the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) and the Pervasive Developmental Problems (PDP) subscale of the Child Behavior Checklist at 6 years. We defined clinical PDP if scores were >98th percentile of the norm population. Diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) was clinically confirmed in 30 children. We observed a modest association between overall neuromotor development in infants and autistic traits. Low muscle tone in infancy predicted autistic traits measured by SRS (adjusted beta\u2009=\u20090.05, 95% CI for B: 0.00-0.02, P\u2009=\u20090.01), and PDP (adjusted beta\u2009=\u20090.08, 95% CI for B: 0.04-0.10, P\u2009<\u20090.001). Similar results emerged for the association of low muscle tone and clinical PDP (adjusted OR\u2009=\u20091.36, 95% CI: 1.08-1.72, P\u2009=\u20090.01) at age 6 years. Results remained unchanged if adjusted for child intelligence. There was no association between high muscle tone and SRS or PDP. Exclusion of children with ASD diagnosis did not change the association. This large study showed a prospective association of infant muscle tone with autistic traits in childhood. Our findings suggest that early detection of low muscle tone might be a gateway to improve early diagnosis of ASD.

Early life cognitive ability has been linked to subsequent dementia risk but studies to date have been small and none has examined sex differences.\nIn the 1932 Scottish Mental Survey cohort, we related intelligence test scores at age 11 years in 16,370 boys and 16,097 girls (born in 1921) to incident dementia ages \u226565 years as ascertained using probabilistic linkage to electronic health records up to the age of 92 years (1,231 cases in men, 2,163 in women; median follow-up 15 years).\nCompared with the highest intelligence group (IQ \u2265115), dementia risk was raised in the lowest-scoring category (<85) and these associations were stronger for women (hazard ratio; 95% confidence interval: 1.51; 1.29, 1.76) than men (1.19; 0.98, 1.44; P value for interaction by gender: 0.054). There was evidence of a dose-response association between childhood IQ and dementia in women (IQ 100-114.9 compared with \u2265115: 1.18; 1.03, 1.34; IQ 85-99.9: 1.32; 1.15, 1.51; P value for trend <0.001) but not in men (1.05; 0.89, 1.24 and 1.01; 0.85, 1.21; 0.44).\nChildhood intelligence is related to subsequent dementia risk but this association is not the same in men and women. See video abstract at, http://links.lww.com/EDE/B184.", "These studies explore elementary-school-aged children's ability to evaluate circular explanations and whether they respond to receiving weak explanations by expressing interest in additional learning. In the first study, 6-, 8-, and 10-year-olds (n = 53) heard why questions about unfamiliar animals. For each question, they rated the quality of single explanations and later selected the best explanation between pairs of circular and noncircular explanations. When judging single explanations, 8- and 10-year-olds, and to some extent 6-year-olds, provided higher ratings for noncircular explanations compared to circular ones. When selecting between pairs of explanations, all age groups preferred noncircular explanations to circular ones, but older children did so more consistently than 6-year-olds. Children who recognized the weakness of the single circular explanations were more interested in receiving additional information about the question topics. In Study 2, all three age groups (n = 87) provided higher ratings for noncircular explanations compared to circular ones when listening to responses to how questions, but older children showed a greater distinction in their ratings than 6-year-olds. Moreover, the link between recognizing circular explanations as weak and interest in future learning could not be accounted for solely by individual differences in verbal intelligence. These findings illustrate the developmental trajectory of explanation evaluation and support that recognition of weak explanations is linked to interest in future learning across the elementary years. Implications for education are discussed.", "This article tells the story behind our first paper on the fusiform face area (FFA): how we chose the question, developed the methods, and followed the data to find the FFA and subsequently many other functionally specialized cortical regions. The paper's impact had less to do with the particular findings in the paper itself and more to do with the method that it promoted and the picture of the human mind and brain that it led to. The use of a functional localizer to define a candidate region in each subject individually enabled us not just to make pictures of brain activation, but also to ask principled, hypothesis-driven questions about a thing in nature. This method enabled stronger and more extensive tests of the function of each cortical region than had been possible before in humans and, as a result, has produced a large body of evidence that the human cortex contains numerous regions that are specifically engaged in particular mental processes. The growing inventory of cortical regions with distinctive and often very specific functions can be seen as an initial sketch of the basic components of the human mind. This sketch also serves as a roadmap into the vast and exciting new landscape of questions about the computations, structural connections, time course, development, plasticity, and evolution of each of these regions, as well as the hardest question of all: how do these regions work together to produce human intelligence?", "The association between iron and neurocognition remains underexplored in adolescents, and the neurocognitive effects of low and high iron levels have yet to be established. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationships of low and high iron levels with neurocognitive domains in early adolescents.\nThe sample comprised 428 adolescents (12.0 \u00b1 0.4 years) from Jintan, China. Serum iron concentrations were analyzed from venous blood samples and classified into low, normal, and high levels according to the clinical reference range 75-175 \u03bcg/dl. Neurocognition was measured by the Penn Computerized Neurocognitive Battery and Wechsler Intelligence Scale. Generalized linear regression was used to analyze relationships.\nPrevalence rates of iron deficiency, normal iron, and high iron were 13.8%, 76.4%, and 9.8%, respectively. Compared with normal levels, iron deficiency was associated with slower performance in tasks that measured abstraction and mental flexibility (\u03b2 = 107.5, p = .03) and spatial processing ability (\u03b2 = 917.2, p = .04). High serum iron was associated with less accuracy in the spatial processing ability task (\u03b2 = -2.2, p = .03) and a longer reaction time in the task assessing abstraction and mental flexibility (\u03b2 = 702.8, p = .046) compared to normal levels.\nBoth iron deficiency and high iron levels contribute to reduced neurocognitive performance in a domain-specific manner in early adolescents. The dual burden of iron under- and overnutrition should be incorporated into future interventions for improving brain development and cognitive function in adolescents, especially in a Chinese context.", "The study investigated whether age at attainment of 20 developmental milestones within the areas of language, walking, eating, dressing, social interaction, and toilet training was associated with adult intelligence. Mothers of 821 children of the Copenhagen Perinatal Cohort recorded 20 developmental milestones at a 3-year examination, and all children were administered the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale when they were 20-34\u00a0years old. Later attainment of a number of milestones was associated with lower adult IQ with the strongest associations found for those related to language and social interaction. The adjusted full-scale IQ means were 107.0, 101.8, and 100.6 for being able to form a sentence at less than 24\u00a0months, at 24\u00a0months, and later than 24\u00a0months.", "Services making use of information and communication technology (ICT) are of potential\u00a0interest to face the challenges of our aging society. Aim of this article is to describe the possible field of application for ICT-supported services in the management of older adults, in particular those with functional impairment. The current status of ICT-supported services is described and examples of how these services can be implemented in everyday practice\u00a0are given. Upcoming technical solutions and future directions\u00a0are also addressed. An ICT-supported service is not only the technological tool, but its combination with clinical purposes for which it is used and the way it is implemented in everyday care. Patient's satisfaction with ICT-supported services is moderate to good. Actual use of patients is higher than those of professionals but very variable. Frequency\u00a0of use is positively related to clinical outcome. ICT offers a variety of opportunities for the treatment and prevention of frailty and functional decline. Future challenges are related to the intelligence of the systems and making the technologies even more unobtrusive and intuitive.", "Dyslexia is a reading disorder with strong associations with KIAA0319 and DCDC2. Both genes play a functional role in spike time precision of neurons. Strikingly, poor readers show an imprecise encoding of fast transients of speech in the auditory brainstem. Whether dyslexia risk genes are related to the quality of sound encoding in the auditory brainstem remains to be investigated. Here, we quantified the response consistency of speech-evoked brainstem responses to the acoustically presented syllable [da] in 159 genotyped, literate and preliterate children. When controlling for age, sex, familial risk and intelligence, partial correlation analyses associated a higher dyslexia risk loading with KIAA0319 with noisier responses. In contrast, a higher risk loading with DCDC2 was associated with a trend towards more stable responses. These results suggest that unstable representation of sound, and thus, reduced neural discrimination ability of stop consonants, occurred in genotypes carrying a higher amount of KIAA0319 risk alleles. Current data provide the first evidence that the dyslexia-associated gene KIAA0319 can alter brainstem responses and impair phoneme processing in the auditory brainstem. This brain-gene relationship provides insight into the complex relationships between phenotype and genotype thereby improving the understanding of the dyslexia-inherent complex multifactorial condition.", "Most models of sensory processing in the brain have a feedforward architecture in which each stage comprises simple linear filtering operations and nonlinearities. Models of this form have been used to explain a wide range of neurophysiological and psychophysical data, and many recent successes in artificial intelligence (with deep convolutional neural nets) are based on this architecture. However, neocortex is not a feedforward architecture. This paper proposes a first step toward an alternative computational framework in which neural activity in each brain area depends on a combination of feedforward drive (bottom-up from the previous processing stage), feedback drive (top-down context from the next stage), and prior drive (expectation). The relative contributions of feedforward drive, feedback drive, and prior drive are controlled by a handful of state parameters, which I hypothesize correspond to neuromodulators and oscillatory activity. In some states, neural responses are dominated by the feedforward drive and the theory is identical to a conventional feedforward model, thereby preserving all of the desirable features of those models. In other states, the theory is a generative model that constructs a sensory representation from an abstract representation, like memory recall. In still other states, the theory combines prior expectation with sensory input, explores different possible perceptual interpretations of ambiguous sensory inputs, and predicts forward in time. The theory, therefore, offers an empirically testable framework for understanding how the cortex accomplishes inference, exploration, and prediction.", "Individuals who believe intelligence is malleable (a growth mindset) are better able to bounce back from failures than those who believe intelligence is immutable. Event-related potential (ERP) studies among adults suggest this resilience is related to increased attention allocation to errors. Whether this mechanism is present among young children remains unknown, however. We therefore evaluated error-monitoring ERPs among 123 school-aged children while they completed a child-friendly go/no-go task. As expected, higher attention allocation to errors (indexed by larger error positivity, Pe) predicted higher post-error accuracy. Moreover, replicating adult work, growth mindset was related to greater attention to mistakes (larger Pe) and higher post-error accuracy. Exploratory moderation analyses revealed that growth mindset increased post-error accuracy for children who did not attend to their errors. Together, these results demonstrate the combined role of growth mindset and neural mechanisms of attention allocation in bouncing back after failure among young children.", "There is increasing interest in learning how human brain networks vary as a function of a continuous trait, but flexible and efficient procedures to accomplish this goal are limited. We develop a Bayesian semiparametric model, which combines low-rank factorizations and flexible Gaussian process priors to learn changes in the conditional expectation of a network-valued random variable across the values of a continuous predictor, while including subject-specific random effects.\nThe formulation leads to a general framework for inference on changes in brain network structures across human traits, facilitating borrowing of information and coherently characterizing uncertainty. We provide an efficient Gibbs sampler for posterior computation along with simple procedures for inference, prediction and goodness-of-fit assessments. The model is applied to learn how human brain networks vary across individuals with different intelligence scores. Results provide interesting insights on the association between intelligence and brain connectivity, while demonstrating good predictive performance.\nSource code implemented in R and data are available at https://github.com/wangronglu/BNRR.\nrl.wang@duke.edu.\nSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.", "Researchers have demonstrated the prediction of academic functioning by children's prosocial behavior (PB). The goal of our study was to examine the contribution of adolescents' PB for middle and senior high school grades after controlling for stability of achievement and for intelligence, Big Five traits, and sociodemographic variables (i.e., sex and socioeconomic status).\nStudy 1 examined on 165 adolescents (48.5% boys) the prediction by peer-reported PB in 7th grade of academic achievement at the end of junior high school, after controlling for the above variables. Study 2 examined the prediction by 927 (52% girls) 8th graders' PB of academic achievement 5 years later, at the end of senior high school, taking into account the stability of grades, personality traits, and socio-structural variables.\nOverall, hierarchical regression analysis indicated in both studies PB and Openness significantly predicted better grades in the short term and over time despite the high stability of grades across 5 years. Extraversion negatively predicted academic achievement across 1 year in junior high school.\nFindings supported the view of PB as a strength and a key resource for adolescents' academic attainment.", "The maintenance of social/emotional information in working memory (SWM/EWM) has recently been the topic of multiple neuroimaging studies. However, some studies find that SWM/EWM involves a medial frontal-parietal network while others instead find lateral frontal-parietal activations similar to studies of verbal and visuospatial WM. In this study, we asked 26 healthy volunteers to complete an EWM task designed to examine whether different cognitive strategies- maintaining emotional images, words, or feelings- might account for these discrepant results. We also examined whether differences in EWM performance were related to general intelligence (IQ), emotional intelligence (EI), and emotional awareness (EA). We found that maintaining emotional feelings, even when accounting for neural activation attributable to maintaining emotional images/words, still activated a left lateral frontal-parietal network (including the anterior insula and posterior dorsomedial frontal cortex). We also found that individual differences in the ability to maintain feelings were positively associated with IQ and EA, but not with EI. These results suggest that maintaining the feelings of others (at least when perceived exteroceptively) involves similar frontal-parietal control networks to exteroceptive WM, and that it is similarly linked to IQ, but that it also may be an important component of EA.", "Mathematics ability is a complex cognitive trait with polygenic heritability. Genome-wide association study (GWAS) has been an effective approach to investigate genetic components underlying mathematic ability. Although previous studies reported several candidate genetic variants, none of them exceeded genome-wide significant threshold in general populations. Herein, we performed GWAS in Chinese elementary school students to identify potential genetic variants associated with mathematics ability. The discovery stage included 494 and 504 individuals from two independent cohorts respectively. The replication stage included another cohort of 599 individuals. In total, 28 of 81 candidate SNPs that met validation criteria were further replicated. Combined meta-analysis of three cohorts identified four SNPs (rs1012694, rs11743006, rs17778739 and rs17777541) of SPOCK1 gene showing association with mathematics ability (minimum p value 5.67\u2009\u00d7\u200910-10, maximum \u03b2 -2.43). The SPOCK1 gene is located on chromosome 5q31.2 and encodes a highly conserved glycoprotein testican-1 which was associated with tumor progression and prognosis as well as neurogenesis. This is the first study to report genome-wide significant association of individual SNPs with mathematics ability in general populations. Our preliminary results further supported the role of SPOCK1 during neurodevelopment. The genetic complexities underlying mathematics ability might contribute to explain the basis of human cognition and intelligence at genetic level.", "Elderly people's success in attaining rehabilitation goals may be heavily dependent on their achievement motive, but research has not identified the factors that impact on achievement motive or suggested any effective interventions to enhance it. This study demonstrated the effects of personality traits, theories of intelligence, and other factors on achievement motive among community-dwelling elderly people.\nThe dataset consisted of questionnaire responses from 281 elderly people in day-service or day-care centers. A hypothetical model, based on previous research, proposed that achievement motive would be affected by personality traits, theory of intelligence, and other factors (such as drinking and smoking habits, going out for activities, marital status, and hobbies); that personality traits would have some effect on the theory of intelligence and other factors; and that the theory of intelligence would affect personal factors. The hypothetical model was analyzed using a structural equation modeling approach.\nThe model was modified by removing statistically insignificant paths to achievement motive. The modified model exhibited an excellent fit and showed that achievement motive was affected by personality traits, going out for activities, and marital status (although, surprisingly, single people had stronger achievement motive). The model had an adjusted R2 of 0.593 (P < 0.001) for achievement motive.\nThe results indicated that three of the Big Five personality traits (extraversion, conscientiousness, and openness to experience) tend to enhance elderly people's motivation to achieve their goals; moreover, going out more frequently and being single were also associated with achievement motive.", "Neither consensus on best practice nor validated neuropsychological, intelligence, or personality testing batteries exist for assessment and psychological testing on the transgender population. Historically, assessment has been used in a gate-keeping fashion with transgender clients. There are no firm standards of care when considering the content and appropriateness of evaluations conducted presurgically. These evaluations are discussed in the setting of other presurgical evaluations, with a recommendation to move toward a competency to make a medical decisions model. Additional considerations are discussed, such as effects of transition on mood and how to interpret scores in a field where normative data are often gender stratified.", "Failure to detect psychiatric patients' intellectual disabilities may lead to inappropriate treatment and greater use of coercive measures.\nIn this prospective dynamic cohort study we screened for intellectual disabilities in patients admitted to psychiatric wards, and investigated the use of coercive measures with these patients.\nWe used the Screener for Intelligence and Learning disabilities (SCIL) to screen patients admitted to two acute psychiatric wards, and assessed patient characteristics and coercive measures during their stay and over the last 5 years.\nResults on the SCIL suggested that 43.8% of the sample had Mild Intellectual Disability or Borderline Intellectual Functioning (MID/BIF). During their current stay and earlier stays in the previous 5 years, these patients had an increased risk of involuntary admission (OR 2.71; SD 1.28-5.70) and coercive measures (OR 3.95, SD 1.47-10.54).\nThis study suggests that functioning on the level of MID/BIF is very prevalent in admitted psychiatric patients and requires specific attention from mental health care staff.", "It is necessary and essential to discovery protein function from the novel primary sequences. Wet lab experimental procedures are not only time-consuming, but also costly, so predicting protein structure and function reliably based only on amino acid sequence has significant value. TATA-binding protein (TBP) is a kind of DNA binding protein, which plays a key role in the transcription regulation. Our study proposed an automatic approach for identifying TATA-binding proteins efficiently, accurately, and conveniently. This method would guide for the special protein identification with computational intelligence strategies.\nFirstly, we proposed novel fingerprint features for TBP based on pseudo amino acid composition, physicochemical properties, and secondary structure. Secondly, hierarchical features dimensionality reduction strategies were employed to improve the performance furthermore. Currently, Pretata achieves 92.92% TATA-binding protein prediction accuracy, which is better than all other existing methods.\nThe experiments demonstrate that our method could greatly improve the prediction accuracy and speed, thus allowing large-scale NGS data prediction to be practical. A web server is developed to facilitate the other researchers, which can be accessed at http://server.malab.cn/preTata/ .", "This study evaluated the impact of the mother's and father's anxiety sensitivity (AS) and learning experiences on children's AS, and the influence of two moderators: the children's femininity orientation and the children's emotional intelligence (EI). The sample comprised 200 non-clinical children, aged 9-13\u00a0years, and their parents (mothers and fathers). Results revealed that the effect of parental AS on children's AS is moderated by the children's EI for maternal AS and by their femininity traits for paternal AS. Learning experiences following somatic sensations influenced the children's level of AS. More specifically, special attention by parents following a child's somatic sensations (reinforcement and transmission of information) was associated with high AS in children. Parental reactions of fear following a parent's somatic sensations (modelling) seem to predict higher scores for AS when the link is moderated by the child's femininity orientation. The implications of these findings are discussed. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject The influence of parental factors in child's AS has been demonstrate, but these studies are limited. Specific mechanisms might condition the relationship between child's AS and parental factors. What does this study add? Learning experiences and parental AS influence the child's level of AS. It is important to consider the influence of mothers and fathers in child's AS. Child's emotional intelligence and expressive traits may moderate the effect of parental factors.", "Political debates often suffer from vague-verbiage predictions that make it difficult to assess accuracy and improve policy. A tournament sponsored by the U.S. intelligence community revealed ways in which forecasters can better use probability estimates to make predictions-even for seemingly \"unique\" events-and showed that tournaments are a useful tool for generating knowledge. Drawing on the literature about the effects of accountability, the authors suggest that tournaments may hold even greater potential as tools for depolarizing political debates and resolving policy disputes.", "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a general term that implies the use of a computer to model intelligent behavior with minimal human intervention. AI is generally accepted as having started with the invention of robots. The term derives from the Czech word robota, meaning biosynthetic machines used as forced labor. In this field, Leonardo Da Vinci's lasting heritage is today's burgeoning use of robotic-assisted surgery, named after him, for complex urologic and gynecologic procedures. Da Vinci's sketchbooks of robots helped set the stage for this innovation. AI, described as the science and engineering of making intelligent machines, was officially born in 1956. The term is applicable to a broad range of items in medicine such as robotics, medical diagnosis, medical statistics, and human biology-up to and including today's \"omics\". AI in medicine, which is the focus of this review, has two main branches: virtual and physical. The virtual branch includes informatics approaches from deep learning information management to control of health management systems, including electronic health records, and active guidance of physicians in their treatment decisions. The physical branch is best represented by robots used to assist the elderly patient or the attending surgeon. Also embodied in this branch are targeted nanorobots, a unique new drug delivery system. The societal and ethical complexities of these applications require further reflection, proof of their medical utility, economic value, and development of interdisciplinary strategies for their wider application.", "We examined relationships between individual differences in orthographic priming and a battery of measures assessing orthographic processing ability, reading history, current reading ability, and verbal intelligence in university students. Pronounceable and unpronounceable nonword primes preceded word and nonword targets. Individual differences in nonword reading skill and other measures of reading and spelling ability were associated with the degree of orthographic priming. Individuals with less phonological decoding skill benefited more from anagram primes for word targets preceded by unpronounceable primes and nonword targets preceded by pronounceable primes. Analyses of extreme groups revealed that the group with the lowest phonemic decoding efficiency scores showed a general benefit of orthographic relatedness, while the group with the highest phonemic decoding efficiency scores showed a benefit only under certain conditions. Thus, individuals with worse nonword reading skills may have less precise orthographic representations and therefore benefit more from overlapping coarse-grained orthographic information, regardless of the pronounceability of the prime or the lexical status of the target. These findings demonstrate that university students vary in their orthographic processing skill and the degree to which orthographic information is used during word recognition.", "Personality is a major factor in many kinds of behavior, one of which is criminal behavior. To determine what makes a criminal \"a criminal,\" we must understand his/her personality. This study tries to identify different personality traits which link criminals to their personality.\nIn the present study, 37 male criminals of district jail of Dhanbad (Jharkhand) and 36 normal controls were included on a purposive sampling basis. Each criminal was given a personal datasheet and Cattel's 16 personality factors (PFs) scale for assessing their sociodemographic variables and different personality traits.\nThe objective of this study was to examine the relation between personality traits and criminal behavior, and to determine whether such factors are predictive of future recidivism.\nResults indicated high scores on intelligence, impulsiveness, suspicion, self-sufficient, spontaneity, self-concept control factors, and very low scores on emotionally less stable on Cattel's 16 PFs scale in criminals as compared with normal.\nCriminals differ from general population or non criminals in terms of personality traits.", "Ecosystem services modelling tools can help land managers and policy makers evaluate the impacts of alternative management options or changes in land use on the delivery of ecosystem services. As the variety and complexity of these tools increases, there is a need for comparative studies across a range of settings, allowing users to make an informed choice. Using examples of provisioning and regulating services (water supply, carbon storage and nutrient retention), we compare three spatially explicit tools - LUCI (Land Utilisation and Capability Indicator), ARIES (Artificial Intelligence for Ecosystem Services) and InVEST (Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs). Models were parameterised for the UK and applied to a temperate catchment with widely varying land use in North Wales. Although each tool provides quantitative mapped output, can be applied in different contexts, and can work at local or national scale, they differ in the approaches taken and underlying assumptions made. In this study, we focus on the wide range of outputs produced for each service and discuss the differences between each modelling tool. Model outputs were validated using empirical data for river flow, carbon and nutrient levels within the catchment. The sensitivity of the models to land-use change was tested using four scenarios of varying severity, evaluating the conversion of grassland habitat to woodland (0-30% of the landscape). We show that, while the modelling tools provide broadly comparable quantitative outputs, each has its own unique features and strengths. Therefore the choice of tool depends on the study question.", "Tony is a 6-year-old multiracial boy diagnosed as having attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder-combined type who is followed in your primary care practice and has started on a stimulant medication. Tony continues to have difficulty with emotion regulation and impulse control both at home and at school. He was asked to leave his private school soon after beginning first grade because of physical fighting, emotional outbursts, and arguing with teachers.His mother made the decision to enroll Tony in online virtual schooling for the remainder of the academic year, with the plan to transition back to traditional school for the next academic year. They have enrolled in a program that offers lessons online and sends materials to the home for the child to use to complete certain types of assignments (e.g., science experiments). Virtual schools are different from traditional home schooling because children receive their instruction from teachers online with parental assistance as opposed to parents being responsible for teaching all material. Tony's mother comes to your practice requesting assistance with setting up an appropriate school environment for her son at home, where she can monitor and support his academic progress.Tony is a bright child, with an Intelligence Quotient in the superior range. He has advanced academic skills, but he becomes dysregulated if he is told he is wrong or that he has answered a question incorrectly. For example, if he answered a question incorrectly in class, he would become verbally abusive toward his teacher and often have temper tantrums. This challenging behavior occurred daily at school and was one of the factors leading to his expulsion. The behavior had predated the introduction of stimulant medication and had remained consistent after he began medication.Tony's parents are highly educated, and both parents hold professional jobs with steady income. His parents have good command of typical behavior management strategies such as the use of rewards, time out, and behavioral contingencies to target noncompliance and temper tantrums. However, Tony's difficulty identifying and regulating his emotions leads to emotional outbursts and shutdowns that have thus far been unresponsive to standard behavior management techniques. Tony continued to have outbursts even when the behavior was ignored. His mother is concerned not only about his learning during the coming year but also about his social relationships and the family dynamic. Tony's outbursts cause significant disruption in the home and are a source of tension among parents and siblings.His mother is asking for advice on how to support his behavior better at home now that he will be spending his entire day there. How might you assist this child and his mother by helping to integrate therapeutic goals into the academic environment?", "The environmental contributions to autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and their informative content for diagnosing the condition are still largely unknown. The objective of this study was to investigate associations between early medical events and ASD, as well as autistic traits, in twins, to test the hypothesis of a cumulative environmental effect on ASD risk. A total of 80 monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs (including a rare sample of 13 twin pairs discordant for clinical ASD) and 46 dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs with varying autistic traits, were examined for intra-pair differences in early medical events (for example, obstetric and neonatal factors, first year infections). First, differences in early medical events were investigated using multisource medical records in pairs qualitatively discordant for ASD. The significant intra-pair differences identified were then tested in relation to autistic traits in the remaining sample of 100 pairs, applying generalized estimating equations analyses. Significant association of the intra-pair differences in the MZ pairs were found for the cumulative load of early medical events and clinical ASD (Z=-2.85, P=0.004) and autistic traits (\u03b2=78.18, P=0.002), as well as infant dysregulation (feeding, sleeping abnormalities, excessive crying and worriedness), when controlling for intelligence quotient and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder comorbidity. The cumulative load of early medical events in general, and infant dysregulation in particular, may index children at risk of ASD owing to non-shared environmental contributions. In clinical practice, these findings may facilitate screening and early detection of ASD.", "Lucy is a 12-year-old Latina whose mother brought her to the pediatric clinic for help with her anxiety symptoms, \"hearing voices,\" and episodes of \"spacing out.\" Lucy did not cry at birth secondary to vocal cord paralysis and still has the tracheostomy performed at a few days of life. In addition to her neonatal intensive care unit stay, she has been hospitalized for pneumonia. Her mother says she is \"sickly\" and has a weak immune system due to her asthma symptoms. Lucy also experiences somatic complaints related to gastroesophageal reflux and constipation.Lucy is described as being \"in another world\" and must be called several times before she responds. Lucy states she is nervous \"all the time\" and often experiences a fast heartbeat, chest pain, and headache. Her attention and internalizing problems began at age 4 years and have worsened since she entered adolescence. When she is alone in the dark, she sees an unknown person and becomes frightened. She hears the voice of her paternal uncle telling her something will harm her mother and runs crying to \"check\" on her. Lucy also says she hears voices of paternal family members fighting. She has dreamed that her paternal uncle stabbed her in an alley. Lucy reports experiencing sadness and feelings of wanting to die. She has not tried to harm herself and has no plan to do this. She states that she does not know when she is awake or asleep and \"hate people talking in my head.\" She does not report drug use.Lucy's family is bilingual, English and Spanish. Her mother works part-time as a nutritionist, and her father is a machinist. Her father receives counseling for anger management, and there have been previous unsub- stantiated child abuse reports involving Lucy and her younger brother. The maternal uncle has been involved in a gang and attempts to phone Lucy's mother, who does not wish to have contact with him. Lucy's mother expresses strong Christian religious and spiritual beliefs, including demons and spirits that may enter her home and can be cast off with prayer. Recently, the family purchased a \"cuadro\" (picture) at a yard sale, and Lucy's mother said this resulted in footprints in the bathroom that are disappearing with prayer, guidance from the church minister, and discarding of the \"cuadro.\"The primary pediatrician ordered a home school program, given Lucy's frequent illnesses. She is progressing well with a special education teacher. Her recent psychological evaluation at school showed a below average nonverbal intelligence quotient, with strengths in the areas of perceptual, logical, and abstract relationships. Lucy's mother in the past has been hesitant to follow through with psychiatric evaluation because \"it is up to God.\"In the clinic, she is pale and slender with an ethereal look. She is awake and alert with appropriate affect and mentation. Her tracheostomy is intact without any respiratory distress noted. There are no signs of drug use or active hallucinations. You are left wondering whether these voices need psychiatric management.", "Previous research has shown that higher Emotional Intelligence (EI) is associated with better academic and work performance. The present study intended to explore the relationship between EI, perceived stress and academic performance and associated factors among medical undergraduates.\nThis descriptive cross-sectional research study was conducted among 471 medical undergraduates of 2nd, 4th and final years of University of Colombo, Sri Lanka. Students were rated on self administered Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) and Schutte Self-Report Emotional Intelligence Test (SEIT). Examination results were used as the dichotomous outcome variable in a logistic regression analysis.\nFemales had higher mean EI scores (p\u2009=\u20090.014). A positive correlation was found between the EI score and the number of extracurricular activities (r\u2009=\u20090.121, p\u2009=\u20090.008). Those who were satisfied regarding their choice to study medicine, and who were planning to do postgraduate studies had significantly higher EI scores and lower PSS scores (p\u2009<0.001). Among final year undergraduates, those who passed the Clinical Sciences examination in the first attempt had a higher EI score (p\u2009<0.001) and a lower PSS score (p\u2009<0.05). Results of the binary logistic-regression analysis in the entire study population indicated that female gender (OR:1.98) and being satisfied regarding their choice of the medical undergraduate programme (OR:3.69) were significantly associated with passing the examinations. However, PSS Score and engagement in extracurricular activities were not associated with 'Examination Results'.\nHigher EI was associated with better academic performance amongst final year medical students. In addition a higher EI was observed in those who had a higher level of self satisfaction. Self-perceived stress was lower in those with a higher EI. Enhancing EI might help to improve academic performance among final year medical student and also help to reduce the stress levels and cultivate better coping during professional life in the future.", "In people with intellectual disabilities, an enriched environment can stimulate the acquisition of motor skills and could partially repair neuronal impairment thanks to exploration and motor activity. A deficit in environmental and motor stimulation leads to low scores in intelligence tests and can cause serious motor skill problems. Although studies in humans do not give much evidence for explaining basic mechanisms of intellectual disability and for highlighting improvements due to enriched environmental stimulation, animal models have been valuable in the investigation of these conditions. Here, we discuss the role of environmental enrichment in four intellectual disabilities: Foetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD), Down, Rett, and Fragile X syndromes.", "This article reviews 100 years of research on individual differences and their measurement, with a focus on research published in the Journal of Applied Psychology. We focus on 3 major individual differences domains: (a) knowledge, skill, and ability, including both the cognitive and physical domains; (b) personality, including integrity, emotional intelligence, stable motivational attributes (e.g., achievement motivation, core self-evaluations), and creativity; and (c) vocational interests. For each domain, we describe the evolution of the domain across the years and highlight major theoretical, empirical, and methodological developments, including relationships between individual differences and variables such as job performance, job satisfaction, and career development. We conclude by discussing future directions for individual differences research. Trends in the literature include a growing focus on substantive issues rather than on the measurement of individual differences, a differentiation between constructs and measurement methods, and the use of innovative ways of assessing individual differences, such as simulations, other-reports, and implicit measures.

Fatal cases can be reduced by using the computational techniques in the medical and health system. If the cancer is diagnosed early, the chance of successful treatment increases. In this study, the risk of getting lung cancer will be obtained and patients will be provided with directions to exterminate the risk. After calculating the risk value for lung cancer, status of the patient's susceptibility and resistance to stress is used in determining the effects of stress to disease. In order to resolve the problem, the neuro-fuzzy logic model has been presented. When encouraging results are obtained from the study; the system will form a pre-diagnosis for the people who possibly can have risk of getting cancer due to working conditions or living standards. Therefore, this study will enable these people to take precautions to prevent the risk of cancer. In this study a new t-norm operator has been utilized in the problem. Finally, the performance of the proposed method has been compared to other methods. Beside this, the contribution of neuro-fuzzy logic model in the field of health and topics of artificial intelligence will also be examined in this study.", "The potentially deleterious effects on offspring health of excess maternal stress in pregnancy are important to understand-both whether observed associations are causal and through what mechanisms their effects may exert an influence. In this issue of the Journal, R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen et al. (Am J Epidemiol. 2012;000(0):000-000) provide an ingenious test of a potential pathway through which maternal stress may influence offspring development. Licorice consumption is known to disrupt the ability of the placental enzyme 11\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 to inactivate cortisol before it reaches the fetus, leading to higher levels of cortisol exposure. Higher levels of cortisol exposure are also hypothesized to underlie the mechanism through which maternal stress may disrupt fetal development. Thus licorice consumption may serve, in some ways, to mimic maternal stress. The authors report associations between heavy licorice consumption during pregnancy and a wide range of offspring outcomes, including changes in pubertal timing, intelligence quotient, and mental health. In our view, these results should be considered preliminary; more work needs to be completed to determine the relationship of prenatal licorice consumption to these outcomes. Nonetheless, these intriguing and suggestive results demonstrate that this line of work should be given high priority, and they set the stage for additional research moving forward.", "The putative effectiveness of working memory (WM) training at enhancing cognitive and academic skills is still ardently debated. Several researchers have claimed that WM training fosters not only skills such as visuospatial WM and short-term memory (STM), but also abilities outside the domain of WM, such as fluid intelligence and mathematics. Other researchers, while acknowledging the positive effect of WM training on WM-related cognitive skills, are much more pessimistic about the ability of WM training to improve other cognitive and academic skills. In other words, the idea that far-transfer-that is, the generalization of a set of skills across two domains only loosely related to each other-may take place in WM training is still controversial. In this meta-analysis, the authors focused on the effects of WM training on cognitive and academic skills (e.g., fluid intelligence, attention/inhibition, mathematics, and literacy) in typically developing (TD) children (aged 3 to 16). Whereas WM training exerted a significant effect on cognitive skills related to WM training (g = 0.46), little evidence was found regarding far-transfer effects (g = 0.12). Moreover, the size of the effects was inversely related to the quality of the design (i.e., random allocation to the groups and presence of an active control group). Results suggest that WM training is ineffective at enhancing TD children's cognitive or academic skills and that, when positive effects are observed, they are modest at best. Thus, in line with other types of training, far-transfer rarely occurs and its effects are minimal. (PsycINFO Database Record", "Assessing a person's intelligence level is required in many situations, such as career counseling and clinical applications. EEG evoked potentials in oddball task and fluid intelligence score are correlated because both reflect the cognitive processing and attention. A system for prediction of an individual's fluid intelligence level using single trial Electroencephalography (EEG) signals has been proposed. For this purpose, we employed 2D and 3D contents and 34 subjects each for 2D and 3D, which were divided into low-ability (LA) and high-ability (HA) groups using Raven's Advanced Progressive Matrices (RAPM) test. Using visual oddball cognitive task, neural activity of each group was measured and analyzed over three midline electrodes (Fz, Cz, and Pz). To predict whether an individual belongs to LA or HA group, features were extracted using wavelet decomposition of EEG signals recorded in visual oddball task and support vector machine (SVM) was used as a classifier. Two different types of Haar wavelet transform based features have been extracted from the band (0.3 to 30 Hz) of EEG signals. Statistical wavelet features and wavelet coefficient features from the frequency bands 0.0-1.875 Hz (delta low) and 1.875-3.75 Hz (delta high), resulted in the 100 and 98% prediction accuracies, respectively, both for 2D and 3D contents. The analysis of these frequency bands showed clear difference between LA and HA groups. Further, discriminative values of the features have been validated using statistical significance tests and inter-class and intra-class variation analysis. Also, statistical test showed that there was no effect of 2D and 3D content on the assessment of fluid intelligence level. Comparisons with state-of-the-art techniques showed the superiority of the proposed system.", "The objective of the present work was to elaborate the content of comprehensive psycho-pedagogical examination for the assessment of the overall intelligence level in the children presenting with hearing impairments. The complex of studies to be carried out to achieve this purpose encompasses evaluation of the social, physical, and cognitive development of the children as well as peculiarities of their play activities, their speech and hearing abilities. This approach is believed to enable a teacher of deaf and hard of hearing to identify the individual characteristics of each child and determine those of special importance for the elaboration of educational programs on an individual basis taking into consideration variants of children's development (harmonic, uneven, retarded, etc.). To facilitate the implementation of the proposed method, a special electronic tool (a virtual practice for a teacher of deaf) has been created. The virtual practice is believed to be instrumental in the training of the teachers of deaf for the comprehensive evaluation of the children with cochlear implants.

The villages were assigned at random to the treatment groups.\nSeveral reasons explain the vulnerability of the first 1000 days: rapid growth and development, high nutritional requirements, greater susceptibility to infections, high sensitivity to programming effects and full dependence on others for care, nutrition, and social interaction. Compared with Fresco, Atole improved total nutrient intakes (protein, energy, and micronutrients) and reduced stunting, but only in children\u2009<\u20093 years of age. A study in 2002-2004 showed that schooling, reading, and intelligence were improved in Atole villages, but only in those who received Atole before the age of 3 years. Wages of men were increased by 46% in those provided Atole through the age of 2 years. Findings for cardiovascular disease risk factors were inconclusive, perhaps because of the young age of the sample. A new study focusing on chronic diseases is ongoing (ages 38-54 years).\nThe Guatemalan studies indicate that substantial improvement in adult human capital and economic productivity resulted from the nutrition intervention. This provides a powerful argument for promoting improvements in nutrition in pregnant women and young children in low income countries.", "Variants at microRNA-137 (MIR137), one of the most strongly associated schizophrenia risk loci identified to date, have been associated with poorer cognitive performance. As microRNA-137 is known to regulate the expression of ~1900 other genes, including several that are independently associated with schizophrenia, we tested whether this gene set was also associated with variation in cognitive performance. Our analysis was based on an empirically derived list of genes whose expression was altered by manipulation of MIR137 expression. This list was cross-referenced with genome-wide schizophrenia association data to construct individual polygenic scores. We then tested, in a sample of 808 patients and 192 controls, whether these risk scores were associated with altered performance on cognitive functions known to be affected in schizophrenia. A subgroup of healthy participants also underwent functional imaging during memory (n=108) and face processing tasks (n=83). Increased polygenic risk within the empirically derived miR-137 regulated gene score was associated with significantly lower performance on intelligence quotient, working memory and episodic memory. These effects were observed most clearly at a polygenic threshold of P=0.05, although significant results were observed at all three thresholds analyzed. This association was found independently for the gene set as a whole, excluding the schizophrenia-associated MIR137 SNP itself. Analysis of the spatial working memory fMRI task further suggested that increased risk score (thresholded at P=10-5) was significantly associated with increased activation of the right inferior occipital gyrus. In conclusion, these data are consistent with emerging evidence that MIR137 associated risk for schizophrenia may relate to its broader downstream genetic effects.", "This randomized control study investigates the effects of working memory (WM) training on near (similar WM memory tasks) and far (math problem-solving processes and accuracy tasks) transfer in children aged 7 to 11 years who vary in fluid intelligence. Participants were randomly assigned to either a control group or one of two WM training conditions (repeated practice vs. cued recall). \u200bWhen compared to the control condition, the results show that the cued recall condition yields higher post-test scores for the far transfer measures, whereas the repeated practice condition yields higher scores for the near transfer\u200b measures. However, these finding are qualified by significant treatment \u00d7 fluid intelligence interactions. Thus, improvements in WM and related measures, as well as the positive transfer in learning outcomes, are moderated by fluid intelligence.", "Crowdsourcing has become a popular service computing paradigm for requesters to integrate the ubiquitous human-intelligence services for tasks that are difficult for computers but trivial for humans. This paper focuses on crowdsourcing complex tasks by team formation in social networks (SNs) where a requester connects to a large number of workers. A good indicator of efficient team collaboration is the social connection among workers. Most previous social team formation approaches, however, either assume that the requester can maintain information of all workers and can directly communicate with them to build teams, or assume that the workers are cooperative and be willing to join the specific team built by the requester, both of which are impractical in many real situations. To this end, this paper first models each worker as a selfish entity, where the requester prefers to hire inexpensive workers that require less payment and workers prefer to join the profitable teams where they can gain high revenue. Within the noncooperative SNs, a distributed negotiation-based team formation mechanism is designed for the requester to decide which worker to hire and for the worker to decide which team to join and how much should be paid for his skill service provision. The proposed social team formation approach can always build collaborative teams by allowing team members to form a connected graph such that they can work together efficiently. Finally, we conduct a set of experiments on real dataset of workers to evaluate the effectiveness of our approach. The experimental results show that our approach can: 1) preserve considerable social welfare by comparing the benchmark centralized approaches and 2) form the profitable teams within less negotiation time by comparing the traditional distributed approaches, making our approach a more economic option for real-world applications.", "International evidence suggests youth offenders have greater difficulties with oral language than their nonoffending peers. This study examined the hearing, auditory processing, and language skills of male youth offenders and remandees (YORs) in New Zealand.\nThirty-three male YORs, aged 14-17 years, were recruited from 2 youth justice residences, plus 39 similarly aged male students from local schools for comparison. Testing comprised tympanometry, self-reported hearing, pure-tone audiometry, 4 auditory processing tests, 2 standardized language tests, and a nonverbal intelligence test.\nTwenty-one (64%) of the YORs were identified as language impaired (LI), compared with 4 (10%) of the controls. Performance on all language measures was significantly worse in the YOR group, as were their hearing thresholds. Nine (27%) of the YOR group versus 7 (18%) of the control group fulfilled criteria for auditory processing disorder. Only 1 YOR versus 5 controls had an auditory processing disorder without LI.\nLanguage was an area of significant difficulty for YORs. Difficulties with auditory processing were more likely to be accompanied by LI in this group, compared with the controls. Provision of speech-language therapy services and awareness of auditory and language difficulties should be addressed in youth justice systems.", "Patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) and their natural caregivers experience major lifestyle difficulties. Little is known concerning dyadic (i.e., patient and natural caregiver) characteristics' impact on quality of life. In a sample of depressed patient-caregiver dyads, we examined quality of life (QoL) levels compared with the general population and whether QoL is influenced by emotional intelligence (EI) and coping strategies using the actor-partner interdependence model (APIM).\nThis cross-sectional study involved 79 patient-caregiver dyads. The self-reported data, completed by patients and their primary caregivers, included QoL (SF-36), EI (TEIQue-SF) and coping strategies (BriefCope). The QoL of patients and caregivers was compared with 158 French age-sex-matched healthy controls. The dyadic interactions were analyzed using structural equation modeling.\nPatients and their caregivers experienced lower QoL levels than French age-sex-matched controls. The EI findings showed actor (degree to which the person's EI was associated with his/her own QoL) and partner (degree to which the person's EI was associated with QoL of the other member of the dyad) effects for patients and caregivers. The coping strategies (i.e., problem solving, positive thinking, avoidance and social support) revealed only actor effects.\nQoL is seriously impaired in depressed patients and their primary caregivers and is associated with EI and coping strategies. Targeted interventions focusing on EI and coping strategies could be offered to improve QoL in dyads.", "To develop a competency model for emergency physicians from the perspective of nurses, juxtapose this model with the widely adopted Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) model, and identify competencies that might be unique to the nurses' perspective.\nThe study relied on secondary data originally collected as part of nurses' assessment of emergency physicians' nonclinical skills in the emergency department (ED) of an academic medical center in the Middle East. Participants were 36 registered nurses who had worked in the ED for at least 2 years and had worked for at least 2 shifts per month with the physician being evaluated.\nThrough content analysis, a nurse-led competency model was identified, including 8 core competencies encompassing 33 subcompetencies. The 8 core competencies were emotional intelligence; problem-solving and decisionmaking skills; operations management; patient focus; patient care, procedural skills, and medical knowledge; professionalism; communication skills; and team leadership and management. When the developed model was compared with the ACGME model, the 2 models diverged more than they converged.\nThe nurses' perspective offered distinctive insight into the competencies needed for physicians in an emergency medicine environment, indicating the value of nurses' perspective and shedding light on the need for more systematic and more methodologically sound studies to examine the issue further. The differences between the models highlighted the competencies that were unique to the nurse perspective, and the similarities were indicative of the influence of different perspectives and organizational context on how competencies manifest.", "This retrospective cohort study characterized cognitive and motor outcomes in a large sample of adults who underwent frontal lobe resections for treatment of pharmacoresistant epilepsy.\nNinety patients who underwent unilateral frontal lobe resection for epilepsy (42 language-dominant hemisphere/48 nondominant hemisphere) between 1989 and 2014 completed comprehensive preoperative and postoperative neuropsychological evaluations that included measures of verbal and nonverbal intellectual functioning, attention/working memory, processing speed, language, executive functioning, verbal and visual memory, and motor functioning. Objective methods were used to assess meaningful change across a wide range of abilities and to identify factors associated with neuropsychological decline following frontal lobectomy. Detailed postoperative neuroimaging analysis was conducted to characterize region, extent, and volume of resection.\nForty-eight percent of patients did not demonstrate meaningful postoperative declines in cognition and an additional 42% demonstrated decline in 1 or 2 cognitive domains. When cognitive decline was observed, it usually occurred on measures of intelligence, visuomotor processing speed, or executive functioning. Side and site of resection were unrelated to cognitive outcome, but played a role in decline of contralateral manual dexterity following supplementary motor area resection. Higher preoperative ability, older age at surgery, absence of a malformation of cortical development on MRI, and poor seizure outcome were related to cognitive decline on some measures, but had poor sensitivity in identifying at-risk patients.\nThe vast majority of patients who undergo frontal lobectomy for treatment of pharmacoresistant epilepsy demonstrate good cognitive and motor outcomes.", "Isela is an 11-year-old Mexican-American girl with mild intellectual disability. During a vacation with her family, she went swimming with dolphins. A few days later, Isela awoke at night with laughing spells; during the day, she was pacing, aggressive, and had a decline in self-care and communication skills. Her parents attributed the symptoms to the dolphins. She was evaluated by a pediatric neurologist. The sleep-deprived electroencephalogram, brain magnetic resonance imaging, lumbar puncture, and thyroid function tests were normal. A genomic microarray was sent. The neurologist initiated empirical therapy for seizures with lamotrigine, which caused a rash. It was discontinued. She was then treated with oxcarbazepine followed by topiramate for several months without any change in symptoms. Comparative genomic hybridization revealed a small deletion at 14q13.1, which includes the NPAS3 gene. Psychiatry was consulted after several months of persistent symptoms. Isela seemed to be laughing in response to internal stimuli. Owing to the decline in communication and her apparent preoccupation with visual and auditory internal stimuli, Isela could not be interviewed adequately to confirm that she was experiencing hallucinations, but her laughter seemed to be in response to hallucinations. Isela was diagnosed with disorganized schizophrenia with psychosis. Risperidone was prescribed.A psychology evaluation was completed a few months later. Parents noted significant improvement after starting risperidone with reduced inappropriate laughing spells, reduced pacing, as well as improved eating, sleeping, communication, and self-care. Cognitive assessment with the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence-II indicated the following: verbal estimated intelligence quotient (IQ) = 70, perceptual estimated IQ = 71, and full-scale estimated IQ = 68. There was no cognitive decline compared with testing at school 4 years previously. Although psychotic symptoms were significantly improved on antipsychotic medication and function appeared to have been restored to her previous level, her parents continued to perceive a significant decline of functioning, and they continued to attribute the psychosis to swimming with the dolphins.", "Deep learning has received significant attention recently as a promising solution to many problems in the area of artificial intelligence. Among several deep learning architectures, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) demonstrate superior performance when compared to other machine learning methods in the applications of object detection and recognition. We use a CNN for image enhancement and the detection of driving lanes on motorways. In general, the process of lane detection consists of edge extraction and line detection. A CNN can be used to enhance the input images before lane detection by excluding noise and obstacles that are irrelevant to the edge detection result. However, training conventional CNNs requires considerable computation and a big dataset. Therefore, we suggest a new learning algorithm for CNNs using an extreme learning machine (ELM). The ELM is a fast learning method used to calculate network weights between output and hidden layers in a single iteration and thus, can dramatically reduce learning time while producing accurate results with minimal training data. A conventional ELM can be applied to networks with a single hidden layer; as such, we propose a stacked ELM architecture in the CNN framework. Further, we modify the backpropagation algorithm to find the targets of hidden layers and effectively learn network weights while maintaining performance. Experimental results confirm that the proposed method is effective in reducing learning time and improving performance.", "The effects of different formulations and manufacturing process conditions on the physical properties of a solid dosage form are of importance to the pharmaceutical industry. It is vital to have in-depth understanding of the material properties and governing parameters of its processes in response to different formulations. Understanding the mentioned aspects will allow tighter control of the process, leading to implementation of quality-by-design (QbD) practices. Computational intelligence (CI) offers an opportunity to create empirical models that can be used to describe the system and predict future outcomes in silico. CI models can help explore the behavior of input parameters, unlocking deeper understanding of the system. This research endeavor presents CI models to predict the porosity of tablets created by roll-compacted binary mixtures, which were milled and compacted under systematically varying conditions. CI models were created using tree-based methods, artificial neural networks (ANNs), and symbolic regression trained on an experimental data set and screened using root-mean-square error (RMSE) scores. The experimental data were composed of proportion of microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) (in percentage), granule size fraction (in micrometers), and die compaction force (in kilonewtons) as inputs and porosity as an output. The resulting models show impressive generalization ability, with ANNs (normalized root-mean-square error [NRMSE] =1%) and symbolic regression (NRMSE =4%) as the best-performing methods, also exhibiting reliable predictive behavior when presented with a challenging external validation data set (best achieved symbolic regression: NRMSE =3%). Symbolic regression demonstrates the transition from the black box modeling paradigm to more transparent predictive models. Predictive performance and feature selection behavior of CI models hints at the most important variables within this factor space.", "The neuropsychological literature on preterm-born children with spastic diplegia due to periventricular leukomalacia is convergent in reporting deficits in non-verbal intelligence and in visuo-spatial abilities. Nevertheless, other cognitive functions have found to be impaired, but data are scant and not correlated with neuroimaging findings.\nThis study analyzes the neuropsychological strengths and weaknesses in preterm-born children with spastic diplegia (pSD) and their relationships with neuroanatomical findings, investigated by a novel scale for MRI classification.\nNineteen children with pSD, mild to moderate upper limb impairment and Verbal IQ>80, and 38 normal controls were evaluated with a comprehensive neuropsychological battery (NEPSY-II), assessing Attention/Executive Functioning, Language, Memory, Sensorimotor, Social Perception and Visuospatial Processing domains. The MRIs were quantitatively scored for lesion severity.\nThe results showed that, beyond core visuo-spatial and sensory-motor deficits, impairments in attention and executive functions were present in more than half of the sample, particularly in children with damage to the anterior corpus callosum.\nThe findings are discussed in terms of clinical and rehabilitative implications tailored for pSD subgroups diversified for neuropsychological and neuroanatomical characteristics.", "We explored the current practice with respect to the neuropsychological assessment of surgical epilepsy patients in European epilepsy centers, with the aim of harmonizing and establishing common standards. Twenty-six epilepsy centers and members of \"E-PILEPSY\" (a European pilot network of reference centers in refractory epilepsy and epilepsy surgery), were asked to report the status of neuropsychological assessment in adults and children via two different surveys. There was a consensus among these centers regarding the role of neuropsychology in the presurgical workup. Strong agreement was found on indications (localization, epileptic dysfunctions, adverse drugs effects, and postoperative monitoring) and the domains to be evaluated (memory, attention, executive functions, language, visuospatial skills, intelligence, depression, anxiety, and quality of life). Although 186 different tests are in use throughout these European centers, a core group of tests reflecting a moderate level of agreement could be discerned. Variability exists with regard to indications, protocols, and paradigms for the assessment of hemispheric language dominance. For the tests in use, little published evidence of clinical validity in epilepsy was provided. Participants in the survey reported a need for improvement concerning the validity of the tests, tools for the assessment of everyday functioning and accelerated forgetting, national norms, and test co-normalization. Based on the present survey, we documented a consensus regarding the indications and principles of neuropsychological testing. Despite the variety of tests in use, the survey indicated that there may be a core set of tests chosen based on experience, as well as on published evidence. By combining these findings with the results of an ongoing systematic literature review, we aim for a battery that can be recommended for the use across epilepsy surgical centers in Europe.", "Learning and memory are essential for academic success and everyday functioning, but the pattern of memory skills and its relationship to executive functioning in children with focal epilepsy is not fully delineated. We address a gap in the literature by examining the relationship between memory and executive functioning in a pediatric focal epilepsy population.\nSeventy children with focal epilepsy and 70 typically developing children matched on age, intellectual functioning, and gender underwent neuropsychological assessment, including measures of intelligence (Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence [WASI]/Differential Ability Scales [DAS]), as well as visual Children's Memory Scale (CMS Dot Locations) and verbal episodic memory (Wide Range Assessment of Memory and Learning [WRAML] Story Memory and California Verbal Learning Test for Children [CVLT-C]). Executive functioning was measured directly (WISC-IV Digit Span Backward; Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals, Fourth Edition (CELF-IV) Recalling Sentences) and by parent report (Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function [BRIEF]).\nChildren with focal epilepsy had lower delayed free-recall scores than controls across visual and verbal memory tasks (p = 0.02; partial \u03b72 = 0.12). In contrast, recognition memory performance was similar for patients and controls (p = 0.36; partial \u03b72 = 0.03). Children with focal epilepsy demonstrated difficulties in working memory (p = 0.02; partial \u03b72 = 0.08) and planning/organization (p = 0.02) compared to controls. Working memory predicted 9-19% of the variance in delayed free recall for verbal and visual memory; organization predicted 9-10% of the variance in verbal memory. Patients with both left and right focal epilepsy demonstrated more difficulty on verbal versus visual tasks (p = 0.002). Memory performance did not differ by location of seizure foci (temporal vs. extratemporal, frontal vs. extrafrontal).\nChildren with focal epilepsy demonstrated memory ability within age-level expectations, but delayed free recall was inefficient compared to typically developing controls. Memory difficulties were not related to general cognitive impairment or seizure localization. Executive functioning accounted for significant variance in memory performance, suggesting that poor executive control negatively influences memory retrieval.", "Australian male Vietnam veterans (N = 388) were assessed 22 and 36 years after their return to Australia using standardized diagnostic interviews, with added data from Army records and self-report questionnaires. Among veterans who ever had posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), 50.3% had a current diagnosis at the second assessment; of those who had a current diagnosis at Wave 1, 46.9% were also current at Wave 2. Late onset occurred for 19.0% of veterans, of whom 60.8% were current at Wave 2. Multivariate analysis compared veterans with no history of PTSD (n = 231) with veterans who had ever had PTSD (n = 157) to assess risk factors for PTSD incidence; and veterans with a history, but not current PTSD (n = 78) with veterans who had current PTSD at the second assessment (n = 79) to assess risk factors for failure to remit. Incidence was associated with lower education, shorter Army training predeployment, higher combat, excess drinking, and help-seeking after return to Australia. Prevalence was associated with having a father who saw combat in World War II, being injured in battle, having a lower intelligence test score, experiencing higher combat, and having a diagnosis of phobia at the first assessment. Only combat was common to incidence and prevalence.", "We present preliminary data on the role of emotional intelligence (EI) in mediating the relationship between psychopathy and detention term of authors of property crimes. We assumed that the detention term is an approximation of the severity of criminal behavior. A sample of 24 property offenders were individually administered a brief anamnestic interview, the Psychopathic Personality Inventory-Revised (PPI-R), and the Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test (MSCEIT). Information concerning the detention term was obtained from prison records. A mediation model was applied to the data showing that offenders high in psychopathic traits (i.e., total PPI-R score and Self-centered dimension of PPI-R) have a low level of ability EI and this is in turn negatively associated with the duration of their prison sentence. Results encourage the investigation of ability EI as a protective factor against the antisocial outcomes of psychopathic disorder.", "This study is an effort to explore the relationship between spiritual intelligence, religiosity and life satisfaction in elderly Pakistani Muslims. A non-probability purposive sampling technique is utilized in order to recruit a sample of 100 elderly people (n\u00a0=\u00a050 men; n\u00a0=\u00a050\u00a0=\u00a0women). Standardized questionnaires were used for collecting data. Data analysis was carried out using Pearson product-moment correlation analysis and independent sample t test. Findings revealed a significant correlation between spiritual intelligence, religiosity and life satisfaction among Pakistani elderly Muslim people. Gender differences were considered while conducting the study, and findings are valid for both male and female elderly Pakistani Muslims. Some findings of this study endorse findings of some previous studies, and it adds latest insights to the existing body of knowledge on the subject.", "Fluoride and arsenic are inorganic contaminants that occur in the natural environment. Chronic fluoride and/or arsenic exposure can induce developmental neurotoxicity and negatively influence intelligence in children, although the underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. This study explored the effects of fluoride and arsenic exposure in drinking water on spatial learning, memory and key protein expression in the ERK/CREB signaling pathway in hippocampal and cerebral cortex tissue in rat offspring. Pregnant rats were divided into four groups. Control rats drank tap water, while rats in the three exposure groups drank water with sodium fluoride (100mg/L), sodium arsenite (75mg/L), and a sodium fluoride (100mg/L) and sodium arsenite (75mg/L) combination during gestation and lactation. After weaning, rat pups drank the same solution as their mothers. Spatial learning and memory ability of pups at postnatal day 21 (PND21) and postnatal day 42 (PND42) were measured using a Morris water maze. ERK, phospho-ERK (p-ERK), CREB and phospho-CREB (p-CREB) protein expression in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex was detected using Western blot. Compared with the control pups, escape latencies increased in PND42 pups exposed to arsenic and co-exposed to fluoride and arsenic, and the short-term and long-term spatial memory ability declined in pups exposed to fluoride and arsenic, both alone and in combination. Compared with controls, ERK and p-ERK levels decreased in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex in pups exposed to combined fluoride and arsenic. CREB protein expression in the cerebral cortex decreased in pups exposed to fluoride, arsenic, and the fluoride and arsenic combination. p-CREB protein expression in both the hippocampus and cerebral cortex was decreased in pups exposed to fluoride and arsenic in combination compared to the control group. There were negative correlation between the proteins expression and escape latency periods in pups. These data indicate that exposure to fluoride and arsenic in early life stage changes ERK, p-ERK, CREB and p-CREB protein expression in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex of rat offspring at PND21 and PND 42, which may contribute to impaired neurodevelopment following exposure.", "Dispositional envy is distinguished by definition and neurally from episodic envy. While the neural correlates of episodic envy have been evaluated by specific tasks in previous studies, little is known about the structural neural basis of dispositional envy. In this study, we investigated the structural neural basis of dispositional envy underlying individual differences across two independent samples comprising a total of 100 young healthy adults. Firstly, 73 subjects' data (sample 1) was analyzed, and we assessed the association between regional gray matter volume (rGMV) and dispositional envy using voxel-based morphometry (VBM). Furthermore, we explored the role of emotional intelligence in the association between GMV and dispositional envy. VBM indicated that dispositional envy was positively correlated with GMV in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and superior temporal gyrus (STG). We also found that emotional intelligence partially mediated the association between DLPFC volume and dispositional envy. These results were replicated in another independent sample (Sample 2, n\u2009=\u200927). These results provide the first evidence that dispositional envy exhibits a structural neural correlation with the DLPFC and STG, and give a neutral explanation for why individuals with high emotional intelligence exhibit less envy.", "Objective: ADHD adults exhibit deficits in emotion recognition, regulation, and expression. Emotional intelligence (EI) correlates with better life performance and is considered a skill that can be learned and developed. The aim of this study was to assess EI development as ability in ADHD adults, considering the effect of comorbid psychiatric disorders and previous diagnosis of ADHD. Method: Participants (n = 116) were distributed in four groups attending to current comorbidities and previous ADHD diagnosis, and administered the Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test version 2.0 to assess their EI level. Results: ADHD adults with comorbidity with no previous diagnosis had lower EI development than healthy controls and the rest of ADHD groups. In addition, ADHD severity in childhood or in adulthood did not influence the current EI level. Conclusion: EI development as a therapeutic approach could be of use in ADHD patients with comorbidities.", "Given the relationship between language acquisition and music processing, musical perception (MP) skills have been proposed as a tool for early diagnosis of speech and language difficulties; therefore, a psychometric instrument is needed to assess music perception in children under 10 years of age, a crucial period in neurodevelopment. We created a set of 80 musical stimuli encompassing seven domains of music perception to inform perception of tonal, atonal, and modal stimuli, in a random sample of 1006 children, 6-13 years of age, equally distributed from first to fifth grades, from 14 schools (38% private schools) in So Paulo State. The underlying model was tested using confirmatory factor analysis. A model encompassing seven orthogonal specific domains (contour, loudness, scale, timbre, duration, pitch, and meter) and one general music perception factor, the \"m-factor,\" showed excellent fit indices. The m-factor, previously hypothesized in the literature but never formally tested, explains 93% of the reliable variance in measurement, while only 3.9% of the reliable variance could be attributed to the multidimensionality caused by the specific domains. The 80 items showed no differential item functioning based on sex, age, or enrolment in public vs. private school, demonstrating the important psychometric feature of invariance. Like Charles Spearman's g-factor of intelligence, the m-factor is robust and reliable. It provides a convenient measure of auditory stimulus apprehension that does not rely on verbal information, offering a new opportunity to probe biological and psychological relationships with music perception phenomena and the etiologies of speech and language disorders.", "This study aims to (1) investigate the neuropathology of mild to severe pediatric TBI and (2) elucidate the predictive value of conventional and innovative neuroimaging for functional outcome. Children aged 8-14\u00a0years with trauma control (TC) injury (n\u00a0=\u00a027) were compared to children with mild TBI and risk factors for complicated TBI (mildRF+, n\u00a0=\u00a020) or moderate/severe TBI (n\u00a0=\u00a017) at 2.8\u00a0years post-injury. Neuroimaging measures included: acute computed tomography (CT), volumetric analysis on post-acute conventional T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and post-acute diffusion tensor imaging (DTI, analyzed using tract-based spatial statistics and voxel-wise regression). Functional outcome was measured using Common Data Elements for neurocognitive and behavioral functioning. The results show that intracranial pathology on acute CT-scans was more prevalent after moderate/severe TBI (65%) than after mildRF+ TBI (35%; p\u00a0=\u00a0.035), while both groups had decreased white matter volume on conventional MRI (ps\u00a0\u2264\u00a0.029, ds\u00a0\u2265\u00a0-0.74). The moderate/severe TBI group further showed decreased fractional anisotropy (FA) in a widespread cluster affecting all white matter tracts, in which regional associations with neurocognitive functioning were observed (FSIQ, Digit Span and RAVLT Encoding) that consistently involved the corpus callosum. FA had superior predictive value for functional outcome (i.e. intelligence, attention and working memory, encoding in verbal memory and internalizing problems) relative to acute CT-scanning (i.e. internalizing problems) and conventional MRI (no predictive value). We conclude that children with mildRF+ TBI and moderate/severe TBI are at risk of persistent white matter abnormality. Furthermore, DTI has superior predictive value for neurocognitive out-come relative to conventional neuroimaging.", "Patients with TLE are prone to have lower IQ scores than healthy controls. Nevertheless, the impact of IQ differences is not usually considered in studies that compared the cognitive functioning of children with and without epilepsy. This study aimed to determine the effect of using IQ as a covariate on memory and attentional/executive functions of children with TLE.\nThirty-eight children and adolescents with TLE and 28 healthy controls paired as to age, gender, and sociodemographic factors were evaluated with a comprehensive neuropsychological battery for memory and executive functions. The authors conducted three analyses to verify the impact of IQ scores on the other cognitive domains. First, we compared performance on cognitive tests without controlling for IQ differences between groups. Second, we performed the same analyses, but we included IQ as a confounding factor. Finally, we evaluated the predictive value of IQ on cognitive functioning.\nAlthough patients had IQ score in the normal range, they showed lower IQ scores than controls (p\u00a0=\u00a00.001). When we did not consider IQ in the analyses, patients had worse performance in verbal and visual memory (short and long-term), semantic memory, sustained, divided and selective attention, mental flexibility and mental tracking for semantic information. By using IQ as a covariate, patients showed worse performance only in verbal memory (long-term), semantic memory, sustained and divided attention and in mental flexibility. IQ was a predictor factor of verbal and visual memory (immediate and delayed), working memory, mental flexibility and mental tracking for semantic information.\nIntelligence level had a significant impact on memory and executive functioning of children and adolescents with TLE without intellectual disability. This finding opens the discussion of whether IQ scores should be considered when interpreting the results of differences in cognitive performance of patients with epilepsy compared to healthy volunteers.", "Automatically describing the content of an image is a fundamental problem in artificial intelligence that connects computer vision and natural language processing. In this paper, we present a generative model based on a deep recurrent architecture that combines recent advances in computer vision and machine translation and that can be used to generate natural sentences describing an image. The model is trained to maximize the likelihood of the target description sentence given the training image. Experiments on several datasets show the accuracy of the model and the fluency of the language it learns solely from image descriptions. Our model is often quite accurate, which we verify both qualitatively and quantitatively. Finally, given the recent surge of interest in this task, a competition was organized in 2015 using the newly released COCO dataset. We describe and analyze the various improvements we applied to our own baseline and show the resulting performance in the competition, which we won ex-aequo with a team from Microsoft Research.", "General cognitive ability (intelligence) is one of the most heritable behavioural traits and most predictive of socially important outcomes and health. We hypothesized that some of the missing heritability of IQ might lie hidden in the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region, which plays a critical role in many diseases and traits but is not well tagged in conventional GWAS. Using a uniquely powered design, we investigated whether fine-mapping of the HLA region could narrow the missing heritability gap. Our case-control design included 1,393 cases with extremely high intelligence scores (top 0.0003 of the population equivalent to IQ\u2009>\u2009147) and 3,253 unselected population controls. We imputed variants in 200 genes across the HLA region, one SNP (rs444921) reached our criterion for study-wide significance. SNP-based heritability of the HLA variants was small and not significant (h2\u2009=\u20090.3%, SE\u2009=\u20090.2%). A polygenic score from the case-control genetic association analysis of SNPs in the HLA region did not significantly predict individual differences in intelligence in an independent unselected sample. We conclude that although genetic variation in the HLA region is important to the aetiology of many disorders, it does not appear to be hiding much of the missing heritability of intelligence.", "Exploration in an unknown environment is an elemental application for mobile robots. In this paper, we outlined a reinforcement learning method aiming for solving the exploration problem in a corridor environment. The learning model took the depth image from an RGB-D sensor as the only input. The feature representation of the depth image was extracted through a pre-trained convolutional-neural-networks model. Based on the recent success of deep Q-network on artificial intelligence, the robot controller achieved the exploration and obstacle avoidance abilities in several different simulated environments. It is the first time that the reinforcement learning is used to build an exploration strategy for mobile robots through raw sensor information.", "To examine the possible influence of cognitive ability and education at age 50 or 60 on number of teeth at age 70.\nCommunity-dwelling population in Copenhagen, Denmark.\nMen and women born in 1914 (N = 302).\nCognitive ability was assessed using the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale at age 50 or 60. A global cognitive ability measure was used as a continuous measure and according to tertile. Information on education was gathered using a questionnaire at age 50 or 60. A clinical oral examination took place at age 70, and oral health was measured according to number of teeth (<6 vs \u22656). Baseline covariates were smoking, alcohol, sex, and income.\nLogistic regression analyses revealed that greater cognitive ability and educational attainment had a protective effect against risk of tooth loss. The associations were significant and persisted after adjusting for confounders and a two-way interaction between cognitive ability and education.\nHigher education level and cognitive ability measured at age 50 or 60 were associated with having more teeth at age 70. Whether these findings are due to the interaction of these factors with oral health, related socioeconomic factors, or other factors remains to be studied.", "To examine the extent of polysomnographic (PSG) sleep disturbances [obstructive apnea hypopnea index (OAHI), number of wake bouts, arousals, periodic limb movements] and the effect of OAHI on neurobehavioral performance in juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), JIA without OSA, and controls without OSA, adjusting for intelligence quotient (IQ), pain, medications, daytime sleepiness, and wake bouts.\nChildren 6-11 years, 68 with JIA and 67 controls, underwent 1 night of PSG and completed self-reported daytime sleepiness surveys, multiple sleep latency tests for physiological sleepiness, and neurobehavioral performance tests the next day.\nCompared with JIA and controls without OSA, mean OAHI and arousals were significantly higher in JIA with OSA (p < 0.001, respectively). In comparison with JIA and controls without OSA, mean simple reaction time and sustained attention were significantly slower in JIA with OSA, adjusting for IQ, pain, any medication, daytime sleepiness, and wake bouts.\nElevated OAHI is suggestive of obstructive sleep apnea and a comorbidity in JIA that may predispose children with JIA to daytime sleepiness and impaired neurobehavioral performance.", "The efficacy of working memory (WM) training has been a controversial and hotly debated issue during the past years. Despite a large number of training studies and several meta-analyses, the matter has not yet been solved. We conducted a multi-level meta-analysis on the cognitive transfer effects in healthy adults who have been administered WM updating training with n-back tasks, the most common experimental WM training paradigm. Thanks to this methodological approach that has not been employed in previous meta-analyses in this field, we were able to include effect sizes from all relevant tasks used in the original studies. Altogether 203 effect sizes were derived from 33 published, randomized, controlled trials. In contrast to earlier meta-analyses, we separated task-specific transfer (here untrained n-back tasks) from other WM transfer tasks. Two additional cognitive domains of transfer that we analyzed consisted of fluid intelligence (Gf) and cognitive control tasks. A medium-sized transfer effect was observed to untrained n-back tasks. For other WM tasks, Gf, and cognitive control, the effect sizes were of similar size and very small. Moderator analyses showed no effects of age, training dose, training type (single vs. dual), or WM and Gf transfer task contents (verbal vs. visuospatial). We conclude that a substantial part of transfer following WM training with the n-back task is task-specific and discuss the implications of the results to WM training research.", "Earlier puberty, especially in girls, is associated with physical and mental disorders. Prenatal glucocorticoid exposure influences the timing of puberty in animal models, but the human relevance of those findings is unknown. We studied whether voluntary consumption of licorice, which contains glycyrrhizin (a potent inhibitor of placental 11\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2, the \"barrier\" to maternal glucocorticoids), by pregnant women was associated with pubertal maturation (height, weight, body mass index for age, difference between current and expected adult height, Tanner staging, score on the Pubertal Development Scale), neuroendocrine function (diurnal salivary cortisol, dexamethasone suppression), cognition (neuropsychological tests), and psychiatric problems (as measured by the Child Behavior Checklist) in their offspring. The children were born in 1998 in Helsinki, Finland, and examined during 2009-2011 (mean age\u00a0=\u00a012.5 (standard deviation (SD), 0.4) years; n\u00a0=\u00a0378). Girls exposed to high maternal glycyrrhizin consumption (\u2265500\u00a0mg/week) were taller (mean difference (MD)\u00a0=\u00a00.4 SD, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.1, 0.8), were heavier (MD =\u00a00.6 SD, 95% CI: 0.2, 1.9), and had higher body mass index for age (MD = 0.6 SD, 95% CI: 0.2, 0.9). They were also 0.5 standard deviations (95% CI: 0.2, 0.8) closer to adult height and reported more advanced pubertal development (P\u00a0<\u00a00.04). Girls and boys exposed to high maternal glycyrrhizin consumption scored 7 (95% CI: 3.1, 11.2) points lower on tests of intelligence quotient, had poorer memory (P\u00a0<\u00a00.04), and had 3.3-fold (95% CI: 1.4, 7.7) higher odds of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder problems compared with children whose mothers consumed little to no glycyrrhizin (\u2264249\u00a0mg/week). No differences in cortisol levels were found. Licorice consumption during pregnancy may be associated with harm for the developing offspring.", "Critical care is described as complex, detailed healthcare in a unique, technologically rich environment. Critical care nursing requires a strong knowledge base and exceptional clinical and technological skills to cope in this demanding environment. Many registered nurses (RNs) commencing work in these areas may lack resilience, and because of the stress of the critical care environment, coping mechanisms need to be developed. To prevent burnout and to enable critical care nurses to function holistically, emotional intelligence (EI) is essential in the development of such coping mechanisms.\nThe aim of this study was to describe the EI of RNs commencing work in critical care units in a private hospital group in Gauteng, South Africa.\nThe design used for this study was a quantitative descriptive survey. The target population were RNs commencing work in critical care units. Data were collected from RNs using the Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire - Short Form and analysed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences software.\nThe sample (n = 30) had a mean age of 32 years. Most of the participants (63%) qualified through the completion of a bridging course between 2010 and 2012. The majority (62%) of the sample had less than 2 years' experience as RNs.\nThe EI of RNs commencing work in a critical care environment was indicative of a higher range of Global EI, with the well-being factor scoring the highest, followed by the emotionality factor, then self-control, with the sociability factor scoring the lowest.", "To determine whether premorbid IQ mediates performance on neurocognitive tests in individuals diagnosed with cocaine use disorder (CUD).\nRecently abstinent cocaine users (N = 113) completed measures sensitive to the effects of cocaine on cognition: Conners' Continuous Performance Task-II (CPT-II), n-back working memory test, and Hopkins Verbal Learning Task-Revised (HVLT-R). Premorbid IQ was calculated using the Oklahoma Premorbid Intelligence Estimate, which integrates scores from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-III and demographic variables. Participants were grouped according to their premorbid IQ using commonly accepted classifications of ability level (above average [>110], average [90-109], and below average [<90]) and comparisons in neurocognitive performance were performed using one-way analysis of variance.\nSignificant differences were detected between groups on the HVLT-R including Trial 1 (p = .002), total word recall across the 3 list-learning trials (p < .001), and recall following a delay (p < .001). Significant differences were also detected on the N-back, including auditory and visual accuracy (p = .022 and p < .001, respectively) and mean and maximum block length (p < .001). Although significant differences were observed between the above average and average groups (mean effect size = .418 [Cohen's d]), the magnitude of group differences was greatest between the average and below average groups (mean effect size = .716).\nThese results raise questions as to whether the neurocognitive impairment observed in individuals diagnosed with CUD predated the onset of cocaine use or whether the impairments were caused by cocaine use. Because these impairments are potential risk factors for poor treatment outcomes, it is important to consider the need to modify treatment programs to account for lower premorbid IQ. (PsycINFO Database Record", "To evaluate the preliminary validity and reliability of the myTREEHOUSE Self-Concept Assessment for children with cerebral palsy (CP) aged 8 to 12\u00a0years.\nThe myTREEHOUSE Self-Concept Assessment includes 26 items divided into eight domains, assessed across three Performance Perspectives (Personal, Social, and Perceived) and an additional Importance Rating. Face and content validity was assessed by semi-structured interviews with seven expert professionals regarding the assessment construct, content, and clinical utility. Reliability was assessed with 50 children aged 8 to 12\u00a0years with CP (29 males, 21 females; mean age 10y 2mo; Gross Motor Function Classification System [GMFCS] level I=35, II=8, III=5, IV=1; mean Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children - Fourth Edition [WISC-IV]=104), whose data was used to calculate internal consistency of the scale, and a subset of 35 children (20 males, 15 females; mean age 10y 5mo; GMFCS level I=26, II=4, III=4, IV=1; mean WISC-IV=103) who participated in test-retest reliability within 14 to 28\u00a0days.\nFace and content validity was supported by positive expert feedback, with only minor adjustments suggested to clarify the wording of some items. After these amendments, strong internal consistency (Cronbach's \u03b1 0.84-0.91) and moderate to good test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient 0.64-0.75) was found for each component.\nThe myTREEHOUSE Self-Concept Assessment is a valid and reliable assessment of self-concept for children with CP aged 8 to 12\u00a0years.", "In this commentary, we critically review the study of Greiff, Stadler, Sonnleitner, Wolff, and Martin, \"Sometimes less is more: Comparing the validity of complex problem solving measures\" (Intelligence, 2015, 50, 100-113). The main conclusion of Greiff et al. that the \"multiple complex systems\" (MCS) approach to measuring complex problem-solving ability possesses superior validity compared to classical microworld scenarios (\"less is more\") seems to be an overgeneralization based on inappropriate analysis and selective interpretation of results. In its original form, MCS is a useful tool for investigating specific aspects of problem solving within dynamic systems. However, its value as an instrument for the assessment of complex problem solving ability remains limited.", "Azopirillum brasilense is a plant-growth promoting nitrogen-fixing bacteria that is used as bio-fertilizer in agriculture. Since nitrogen fixation has a high-energy demand, the reduction of N2 to NH4+ by nitrogenase occurs only under limiting conditions of NH4+ and O2. Moreover, the synthesis and activity of nitrogenase is highly regulated to prevent energy waste. In A. brasilense nitrogenase activity is regulated by the products of draG and draT. The product of the draB gene, located downstream in the draTGB operon, may be involved in the regulation of nitrogenase activity by an, as yet, unknown mechanism.\nA deep in silico analysis of the product of draB was undertaken aiming at suggesting its possible function and involvement with DraT and DraG in the regulation of nitrogenase activity in A. brasilense. In this work, we present a new artificial intelligence strategy for protein classification, named ProClaT. The features used by the pattern recognition model were derived from the primary structure of the DraB homologous proteins, calculated by a ProClaT internal algorithm. ProClaT was applied to this case study and the results revealed that the A. brasilense draB gene codes for a protein highly similar to the nitrogenase associated NifO protein of Azotobacter vinelandii.\nThis tool allowed the reclassification of DraB/NifO homologous proteins, hypothetical, conserved hypothetical and those annotated as putative arsenate reductase, ArsC, as NifO-like. An analysis of co-occurrence of draB, draT, draG and of other nif genes was performed, suggesting the involvement of draB (nifO) in nitrogen fixation, however, without the definition of a specific function.", "Objective: In this study, a new training method of working memory (WM) was used in the form of structured games, and the effect of training was evaluated with a controlled design. The training method of WM in the form of structured games includes 20 sets of structured games that can improve WM and performance of executive functions. Method: Sixty children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) aged 8.5 to 11.2 years (35 boys), using no stimulant medication were selected. We randomly assigned 30 participants to the experimental group and provided them with WM training. The training was in the form of structured games and was offered to the participants in two 60-minute sessions weekly for 12 weeks. Other participants were assigned to the control group, receiving no treatment. All the participants were also evaluated at follow-up 6 months later. The main measures were the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), the Digit Span and Symbol Search B subscale of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC-IV); and scores of dictation and mathematics were used in terms of pre and post-test. Results: The results of the t-test revealed a significant improvement in the post-test measures as well as a significant reduction of parents' reports of inattentiveness, and improvement in academic performance in the experimental group. However, no significant changes were found in the control group. Conclusion: The academic and working memory improvements were primarily due to the training method of WM. Our findings suggest that the training method of WM in the form of structured games may be a practical method for treating children with ADHD, but it needs to be further investigated.", "It is well known that the performances of evolutionary algorithms are influenced by the quality of their initial populations. Over the years, many different techniques for generating an initial population by uniformly covering as much of the search space as possible have been proposed. However, none of these approaches considers any input from the function that must be evolved using that population. In this paper, a new initialization technique, which can be considered a heuristic space-filling approach, based on both function to be optimized and search space, is proposed. It was tested on two well-known unconstrained sets of benchmark problems using several computational intelligence algorithms. The results obtained reflected its benefits as the performances of all these algorithms were significantly improved compared with those of the same algorithms with currently available initialization techniques. The new technique also proved its capability to provide useful information about the function's behavior and, for some test problems, the initial population produced high-quality solutions. This method was also tested on a few multiobjective problems, with the results demonstrating its benefits.", "The relationships between intelligence and indicators of attention systems functions, and recogni- tion of remembered verbal and figural stimuli, as well as the lateral characteristics of verbal memory in older age (64.5 \u00b1 6.3 years, n = 83; 43 women) and in young group (22.0 \u00b1 4.5 years,.n 133; 83 women) have been studied. It was found that the rate of information selection in conflict condi- tions is a. predictor of the level of intelligence, regardless of age. In old age a higher level of intelligence corresponds to shorter time of executive control system while in the young people accurate significant relations between intelligence and functions of attention systems are not found. In the analysis of memory, aging-independent a positive contribution to the intelligence have the words addressed to the left hemisphere; additionally in the young age the contribution of verbal memory when words addressing the right hemisphere, and in the elderly the retrieval of verbal and figural stimuli. Gender specificity in age-associated reorganization of attention and memory as predictors of intelligence was revealed, i.e. age-related changes were more pronounced in men.", "Causes of death statistics provide crucial health intelligence in national and international communities. An efficient death registration system provides reliable information for health policy system. In many developing countries, death registration systems face a degree of misclassification and incompleteness. There are many impediments to putting an estimate of cause-specific death rates. Addressing those challenges could prevent misleading results.\nOur data was collected by Ministry of Health and Medical Education, Tehran and Isfahan cemeteries from 1995 to 2010. After converting ICD codes of Iran's death registration into GBD codes, 170 underlying causes of deaths were recognized in the available data. A wide range of methods were applied for preparing the data. We used several statistical models to estimate mortality rates in age-sex-province groups for all causes of deaths. The considerable number of combinations for age, sex, cause of death, year, and province variables made further complicated model selection and evaluation of the results.\nTotally, 58.91% of deaths were related to males. The majority of cases of death were classified as NCDs (77.83%) and injuries (14.80%). We extrapolated 71.76% and 14.71% of causes of death by mixed effect model, spline model with parameter 0.9 and 0.6, respectively.\nA comprehensive and unique registration system is able to solve many DRS issues. It is necessary to assess the quality and validity of cause of death data. Scientific methods like analyzing mortality level and cause-of-death data are used to provide an overview for better decisions.", "Bidirectional signalling between the brain and the gastrointestinal tract is regulated at neural, hormonal, and immunological levels. Recent studies have shown that helminth infections can alter the normal gut microbiota. Studies have also shown that the gut microbiota is instrumental in the normal development, maturation and function of the brain. The pathophysiological pathways by which helminth infections contribute to altered cognitive function remain poorly understood.\nWe put forward the hypothesis that gastrointestinal infections with parasitic worms, such as helminths, induce an imbalance of the gut-brain axis, which, in turn, can detrimentally manifest in brain development. Factors supporting this hypothesis are: 1) research focusing on intelligence and school performance in school-aged children has shown helminth infections to be associated with cognitive impairment, 2) disturbances in gut microbiota have been shown to be associated with important cognitive developmental effects, and 3) helminth infections have been shown to alter the gut microbiota structure. Evidence on the complex interactions between extrinsic (parasite) and intrinsic (host-derived) factors has been synthesised and discussed. While evidence in favour of the helminth-gut microbiota-central nervous system hypothesis is circumstantial, it would be unwise to rule it out as a possible mechanism by which gastrointestinal helminth infections induce childhood cognitive morbidity. Further empirical studies are necessary to test an indirect effect of helminth infections on the modulation of mood and behaviour through its effects on the gut microbiota.", "Research on analogical problem solving has shown that people often fail to spontaneously notice the relevance of a semantically remote source analog when solving a target problem, although they are able to form mappings and derive inferences when given a hint to recall the source. Relatively little work has investigated possible individual differences that predict spontaneous transfer, or how such differences may interact with interventions that facilitate transfer. In this study, fluid intelligence was measured for participants in an analogical problem-solving task, using an abridged version of the Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPM) test. In two experiments, we systematically compared the effect of augmenting verbal descriptions of the source with animations or static diagrams. Solution rates to Duncker's radiation problem were measured across varying source presentation conditions, and participants' understanding of the relevant source material was assessed. The pattern of transfer was best fit by a moderated mediation model: the positive impact of fluid intelligence on spontaneous transfer was mediated by its influence on source comprehension; however, this path was in turn modulated by provision of a supplemental animation via its influence on comprehension of the source. Animated source depictions were most beneficial in facilitating spontaneous transfer for those participants with low scores on the fluid intelligence measure.", "An initial clinical assessment is described of a new, commercially available, computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system using artificial intelligence (AI) for thyroid ultrasound, and its performance is evaluated in the diagnosis of malignant thyroid nodules and categorization of nodule characteristics.\nPatients with thyroid nodules with decisive diagnosis, whether benign or malignant, were consecutively enrolled from November 2015 to February 2016. An experienced radiologist reviewed the ultrasound image characteristics of the thyroid nodules, while another radiologist assessed the same thyroid nodules using the CAD system, providing ultrasound characteristics and a diagnosis of whether nodules were benign or malignant. The diagnostic performance and agreement of US characteristics between the experienced radiologist and the CAD system were compared.\nIn total, 102 thyroid nodules from 89 patients were included; 59 (57.8%) were benign and 43 (42.2%) were malignant. The CAD system showed a similar sensitivity as the experienced radiologist (90.7% vs. 88.4%, p\u2009>\u20090.99), but a lower specificity and a lower area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve (specificity: 74.6% vs. 94.9%, p\u2009=\u20090.002; AUROC: 0.83 vs. 0.92, p\u2009=\u20090.021). Classifications of the ultrasound characteristics (composition, orientation, echogenicity, and spongiform) between radiologist and CAD system were in substantial agreement (\u03ba\u2009=\u20090.659, 0.740, 0.733, and 0.658, respectively), while the margin showed a fair agreement (\u03ba\u2009=\u20090.239).\nThe sensitivity of the CAD system using AI for malignant thyroid nodules was as good as that of the experienced radiologist, while specificity and accuracy were lower than those of the experienced radiologist. The CAD system showed an acceptable agreement with the experienced radiologist for characterization of thyroid nodules.", "It is usually assumed that performance on non-verbal intelligence tests reflects visual cognitive processing and that aspects of working memory (WM) will be involved. However, the unique contribution of memory to non-verbal scores is not clear, nor is the unique contribution of vocabulary. Thus, we aimed to investigate these contributions. Non-verbal test scores for 17 individuals with intellectual disability (ID) and 39 children with typical development (TD) of similar mental age were compared to determine the unique contribution of visual and verbal short-term memory (STM) and WM and the additional variance contributed by vocabulary scores. No significant group differences were found in the non-verbal test scores or receptive vocabulary scores, but there was a significant difference in expressive vocabulary. Regression analyses indicate that for the TD group STM and WM (both visual and verbal) contributed similar variance to the non-verbal scores. For the ID group, visual STM and verbal WM contributed most of the variance to the non-verbal test scores. The addition of vocabulary scores to the model contributed greater variance for both groups. More unique variance was contributed by vocabulary than memory for the TD group, whereas for the ID group memory contributed more than vocabulary. Visual and auditory memory and vocabulary contributed significantly to solving visual non-verbal problems for both the TD group and the ID group. However, for each group, there were different weightings of these variables. Our findings indicate that for individuals with TD, vocabulary is the major factor in solving non-verbal problems, not memory, whereas for adolescents with ID, visual STM, and verbal WM are more influential than vocabulary, suggesting different pathways to achieve solutions to non-verbal problems.", "Previous studies have shown that it is possible to detect macroscopic patterns of cultural change over periods of centuries by analyzing large textual time series, specifically digitized books. This method promises to empower scholars with a quantitative and data-driven tool to study culture and society, but its power has been limited by the use of data from books and simple analytics based essentially on word counts. This study addresses these problems by assembling a vast corpus of regional newspapers from the United Kingdom, incorporating very fine-grained geographical and temporal information that is not available for books. The corpus spans 150 years and is formed by millions of articles, representing 14% of all British regional outlets of the period. Simple content analysis of this corpus allowed us to detect specific events, like wars, epidemics, coronations, or conclaves, with high accuracy, whereas the use of more refined techniques from artificial intelligence enabled us to move beyond counting words by detecting references to named entities. These techniques allowed us to observe both a systematic underrepresentation and a steady increase of women in the news during the 20th century and the change of geographic focus for various concepts. We also estimate the dates when electricity overtook steam and trains overtook horses as a means of transportation, both around the year 1900, along with observing other cultural transitions. We believe that these data-driven approaches can complement the traditional method of close reading in detecting trends of continuity and change in historical corpora.", "Working memory is a fundamental cognitive function and is predictive of outcomes and achievement in a wide range of domains from an early age. The focus of this study was to develop a computerized Brazilian version of the Self-Ordered Pointing Task (SOPT) for preschoolers and to provide initial normative and validation data for this task.\nThe sample of the present study was composed of 248 children aged 3 (n\u00a0=\u00a041), 4 (n\u00a0=\u00a088) and 5 (n\u00a0=\u00a0119) years from 13 private and public schools in Belo Horizonte. Children were evaluated with the SOPT and the Columbia Mental Maturity Scale (CMMS), a measure of intelligence, and their parents completed the Brazilian Criterion of Economic Classification (CCEB) to assess their SES. A subsample of parents of 184 children also filled the Child Behavior Checklist for Ages 11/2-5\u00a0years (CBCL 11/2-5), a measure of psychopathology.\nA multiple regression analysis found chronological age, intelligence, and SES to be predictive of performance\u00a0on the SOPT. Furthermore, five-year olds performed better than three- and four-year olds in the task. A difference between children in private and public kindergartens also emerged. Additionally, SOPT performance was negatively correlated with Internalizing, Externalizing, and Total psychopathological problems, as well as to several other psychopathological measures as accessed by the CBCL, although the correlations were small.\nTaken together, this study provides initial normative and validation data for the SOPT, but further validation studies are needed.", "Big data is becoming increasingly more prevalent and it affects the way nurses learn, practice, conduct research and develop policy. The discipline of nursing needs to maximize the benefits of big data to advance the vision of promoting human health and wellbeing. However, current practicing nurses, educators and nurse scientists often lack the required skills and competencies necessary for meaningful use of big data. Some of the key skills for further development include the ability to mine narrative and structured data for new care or outcome patterns, effective data visualization techniques, and further integration of nursing sensitive data into artificial intelligence systems for better clinical decision support. We provide growth-path vision recommendations for big data competencies for practicing nurses, nurse educators, researchers, and policy makers to help prepare the next generation of nurses and improve patient outcomes trough better quality connected health.", "Children with developmental disorders often have poor motor performance. This study aimed to address the association between tactile localization ability, an indicator of body image, and motor function in children with motor deficits. Eighteen children with motor deficits participated, and their upper and lower limbs were assessed. To assess the level to which the patient's body image was developed, a tactile localization task (TLT) was used. In the TLT, experimenters touched a child's fingers, toes, or lower extremities (L/E), and the participants were asked to identify the location of the touch on a body part illustration. We compared TLT ability between high and low motor function groups, and investigated the correlation between TLT and the measures of motor function, age, and non-verbal intelligence. The high motor function group had significantly higher L/E TLT scores than the low motor function group, except in the tests involving the fingers and toes. Furthermore, the L/E TLT correlated only with motor function measures (Gross Motor Function Measure score, measured using one-leg standing time and one-leg hopping ability). The results suggest that children with motor deficits experience developmental delay in terms of their body image.", "Cities in China suffer from severe smog and haze, and a forecasting system with high accuracy is of great importance to foresee the concentrations of the airborne particles. Compared with chemical transport models, the growing artificial intelligence models can simulate nonlinearities and interactive relationships and getting more accurate results. In this paper, the Kolmogorov-Zurbenko (KZ) filter is modified and firstly applied to construct the model using an artificial intelligence method. The concentration of inhalable particles and fine particulate matter in Dalian are used to analyze the filtered components and test the forecasting accuracy. Besides, an extended experiment is made by implementing a comprehensive comparison and a stability test using data in three other cities in China. Results testify the excellent performance of the developed hybrid models, which can be utilized to better understand the temporal features of pollutants and to perform a better air pollution control and management.", "The present study aims to assess the emotional intelligence in relation to socio-demographic and clinical characteristics of patients with depressive disorders. A descriptive correlational study was utilized with a sample of (106) depressed patients who were diagnosed by a psychiatrist with depressive disorders at psychiatric outpatient clinics in Mansoura University Hospital. Data were collected through assessing socio demographic and clinical characteristics, assessing level of depression using Beck Depression Inventory BDI-II, and assessing emotional intelligence using Barchard emotional intelligence scales. Results revealed that emotional intelligence not related significantly to socio demographic and clinical characteristics of patients with depressive disorders, there is a highly significant relationship between emotional intelligence in relation to level of depression and other practices used to alleviate depression. Therefore, it is recommended to conduct a periodical workshops and training programs for adolescents and young in the universities, schools, social clubs, camps and youth organizations to enhance their emotional intelligence in order to prevent depression. In addition, assessing the effect of emotional intelligence programs on preventing and managing depression.", "Objective: To explore the clinical features, diagnosis, treatment and the prognosis of Farber disease by case report and literature review. Method: The clinical information of a case with farber's disease diagnosed in October 2015 at Peking University First Hospital was collected and analyzed, including clinical manifestation, electrophysiology, magnetic resonance imaging, pathology, treatments and prognosis.ASAH1 gene mutational analysis was conducted in the patient and her parents.By using \"Farber's disease, ASAH1\" as keywords, literature was searched from Pubmed, CHKD and HGMD database from January 1951 to January 2016. Result: The girl, 2 years 2 months old, was sent to our hospital in October 2015, with complains of \"joint swelling for 17 months, development regress of intelligence and movement for 11 months, intermittent seizures for 2 months\" .The clinical manifestation of the patient was characterized by painful and deformed joints, subcutaneous nodules, progressive hoarseness, and the progressive neurological system deterioration.Joints swelling and deformity behave as the first symptoms.A series of electroencephalogram showed slow background and spike wave.Visual evoked potential was significantly abnormal.Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed hypomyelination and progressive diffuse brain atrophy.Histology of subcutaneous nodule showed proliferation of the connective tissue with hyalinization, cholesterol crystal like changes, and a large number of foamy cell infiltration.Compound heterozygous mutations of ASAH1 gene, c. 304_305 ins A (p.T102Nfs14) and c. 314T>C (p.L105p), were found in the patient, and the former is inherited from her mother, the latter from her father.Antiepileptic treatment and other symptomatic treatments were delivered to the patient, but the effectiveness was poor.One reference from China hownet and 35 references from Pubmed have reported a total of 26 cases.Twenty out of 26 patients (77%) had the onset under 1 year of age.By region, there were 12 patients (12/26, 46%) from India, and the others around world.Among these 12 indian patients, 10 lack of complete clinical data.Among the rest 16 patients, 4 patients' parents were consanguineous; 8 patients with the main clinical manifestation of painful and deformed joints, subcutaneous nodules, and hoarse cry; 4 patients with hepatic failure and impaired spleen; 5 patients with rapid neurological deterioration; 1 patient with bone destruction; 7 patients under liver and skin biopsies, pathologically showing a large number of foam cells and \"Farber bodies\" . There are 33 genetic mutations, and 45% (15/33) mutations are concentrated in ASAH1 exon 6-10. Conclusion: Farber disease is a rare autosomal recessive disease caused by deficiency of lysosomal acid ceramidase.Histopathology of granulomatous tissue plays an important role in the early diagnosis.", "Friends and spouses tend to be similar in a broad range of characteristics, such as age, educational level, race, religion, attitudes, and general intelligence. Surprisingly, little evidence has been found for similarity in personality-one of the most fundamental psychological constructs. We argue that the lack of evidence for personality similarity stems from the tendency of individuals to make personality judgments relative to a salient comparison group, rather than in absolute terms (i.e., the reference-group effect), when responding to the self-report and peer-report questionnaires commonly used in personality research. We employed two behavior-based personality measures to circumvent the reference-group effect. The results based on large samples provide evidence for personality similarity between romantic partners ( n = 1,101; rs = .20-.47) and between friends ( n = 46,483; rs = .12-.31). We discuss the practical and methodological implications of the findings.", "Structural measures of the hippocampus have been linked to a variety of memory processes and also to broader cognitive abilities. Gross volumetry has been widely used, yet the hippocampus has a complex formation, comprising distinct subfields which may be differentially sensitive to the deleterious effects of age, and to different aspects of cognitive performance. However, a comprehensive analysis of multidomain cognitive associations with hippocampal deformations among a large group of cognitively normal older adults is currently lacking. In 654 participants of the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936 (mean age\u00a0= 72.5, SD\u00a0=\u00a00.71\u00a0years), we examined associations between the morphology of the hippocampus and a variety of memory tests (spatial span, letter-number sequencing, verbal recall, and digit backwards), as well as broader cognitive domains (latent measures of speed, fluid intelligence, and memory). Following correction for age, sex, and vascular risk factors, analysis of memory subtests revealed that only right hippocampal associations in relation to spatial memory survived type 1 error correction in subiculum and in CA1 at the head (\u03b2\u00a0= 0.201, p\u00a0= 5.843\u00a0\u00d7 10-4, outward), and in the ventral tail section of CA1 (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-0.272, p\u00a0=\u00a01.347\u00a0\u00d7 10-5, inward). With\u00a0respect to latent measures of cognitive domains, only deformations associated with processing speed\u00a0survived type 1 error correction in bilateral subiculum (\u03b2absolute \u2264 0.247, p < 1.369\u00a0\u00d7 10-4, outward), bilaterally in the ventral tail section of CA1 (\u03b2absolute \u2264 0.242, p < 3.451\u00a0\u00d7 10-6, inward), and a cluster at the left\u00a0anterior-to-dorsal region of the head (\u03b2\u00a0= 0.199, p\u00a0= 5.220\u00a0\u00d7 10-6, outward). Overall, our results indicate\u00a0that a complex pattern of both inward and outward hippocampal deformations are associated with\u00a0better processing speed and spatial memory in older age, suggesting that complex shape-based hippocampal analyses may provide valuable information beyond gross volumetry.", "Cancer biomarker discovery is a critical part of cancer prevention and treatment. Despite the decades of effort, only a small number of cancer biomarkers have been identified for and validated in clinical settings. Conceptual and methodological breakthroughs may help accelerate the discovery of additional cancer biomarkers, particularly their use for diagnostics. In this review, we have attempted to review the emerging concepts in cancer biomarker discovery, including real-world evidence, open access data, and data paucity in rare or uncommon cancers. We have also summarized the recent methodological progress in cancer biomarker discovery, such as high-throughput sequencing, liquid biopsy, big data, artificial intelligence (AI), and deep learning and neural networks. Much attention has been given to the methodological details and comparison of the methodologies. Notably, these concepts and methodologies interact with each other and will likely lead to synergistic effects when carefully combined. Newer, more innovative concepts and methodologies are emerging as the current emerging ones became mainstream and widely applied to the field. Some future challenges are also discussed. This review contributes to the development of future theoretical frameworks and technologies in cancer biomarker discovery and will contribute to the discovery of more useful cancer biomarkers.", "Cryptomarkets represent an important drug market innovation by bringing buyers and sellers of illegal drugs together in a 'hidden' yet public online marketplace. We ask: How do cryptomarket drug sellers and buyers perceive the risks of detection and arrest, and attempt to limit them?\nWe analyse selected texts produced by vendors operating on the first major drug cryptomarket, Silk Road (N=600) alongside data extracted from the marketplace discussion forum that include buyer perspectives. We apply Fader's (2016) framework for understanding how drug dealers operating 'offline' attempt to reduce the risk of detection and arrest: visibility reduction, charge reduction and risk distribution.\nWe characterize drug transactions on cryptomarkets as 'stretched' across time, virtual and physical space, and handlers, changing the location and nature of risks faced by cryptomarket users. The key locations of risk of detection and arrest by law enforcement were found in 'offline' activities of cryptomarket vendors (packaging and delivery drop-offs) and buyers (receiving deliveries). Strategies in response involved either creating or disrupting routine activities in line with a non-offending identity. Use of encrypted communication was seen as 'good practice' but often not employed. 'Drop shipping' allowed some Silk Road vendors to sell illegal drugs without the necessity of handling them.\nSilk Road participants neither viewed themselves as immune to, nor passively accepting of, the risk of detection and arrest. Rational choice theorists have viewed offending decisions as constrained by limited access to relevant information. Cryptomarkets as 'illicit capital' sharing communities provide expanded and low-cost access to information enabling drug market participants to make more accurate assessments of the risk of apprehension. The abundance of drug market intelligence available to those on both sides of the law may function to speed up innovation in illegal drug markets, as well as necessitate and facilitate the development of law enforcement responses.", "Children with congenital hypothyroidism (CH) detected by newborn screening and adequately treated may have mild cognitive deficits. OBJECTIVES\">To assess the intelligence quotient of children with CH and identify the presence of specific cognitive deficits.\nA group of 60 children with CH detected by newborn screening, who were aged 9-10 years old and received adequate treatment since their first month of life was selected and compared to a control group of 60 children without CH in the same age range. Inclusion criteria: children without concurrent diseases, who were attending school in a single shift, and whose parents had at least completed secondary education. The following tests were administered during individual interviews: the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (third edition), the Rey complex figure test, the Woodcock-Mu\u00f1oz revised test, the Conners Continuous Performance Test II, the Illinois Test of Psycholinguistic Abilities, the verbal fluency test, the Knox Cube Test, the Trail Making Test, the faces test, and the 5 digit test. The statistical analysis was done using Student's t tests (for independent samples) with Bonferroni's correction (p < 0.002).\nEven within the normal average range, significant differences were observed between both groups in terms of total intelligence quotient and performance intelligence quotient (small and moderate effect sizes, respectively). In terms of performance, children with hypothyroidism had a significantly poorer performance in processing speed, reaction times, attention, cognitive flexibility, visuoconstruction, and long-term memory. No significant differences were found between both groups in the verbal area.\nChildren with congenital hypothyroidism and without mental disability had mild cognitive deficits, which should be taken into account for a comprehensive patient care.\nIntroducci\u00f3n. Los ni\u00f1os con hipotiroidismo cong\u00e9nito (HC) detectados por pesquisa neonatal y tratados adecuadamente presentar\u00edan defectos cognitivos leves. Objetivos. Evaluar el coeficiente intelectual de ni\u00f1os con HC e identificar la presencia de d\u00e9ficits cognitivos espec\u00edficos. Poblaci\u00f3n y m\u00e9todos. Se seleccion\u00f3 un grupo de 60 ni\u00f1os con HC, de entre 9 y 10 a\u00f1os, detectados por pesquisa neonatal y tratados adecuadamente desde el primer mes de vida, y se compar\u00f3 con un grupo control de 60 ni\u00f1os sin HC de la misma edad. Fueron criterios de inclusi\u00f3n la ausencia de patolog\u00eda intercurrente, concurrencia a jornada escolar simple y padres con nivel escolar m\u00ednimo de secundaria completa.

Se realiz\u00f3 el an\u00e1lisis estad\u00edstico con pruebas t de Student (muestras independientes) ajustado por Bonferroni (p < 0,002). Resultados. Aun dentro del rango normal promedio, hubo diferencias significativas entre grupos en el coeficiente intelectual total y de ejecuci\u00f3n (tama\u00f1o del efecto peque\u00f1o y moderado, respectivamente). Los ni\u00f1os hipotiroideos presentaron, en el \u00e1rea de ejecuci\u00f3n, significativamente menor desempe\u00f1o en velocidad de procesamiento, tiempos de reacci\u00f3n, atenci\u00f3n, flexibilidad cognitiva, visoconstrucci\u00f3n y memoria a largo plazo. No hubo diferencia significativa entre grupos en el \u00e1rea verbal. Conclusiones. Los ni\u00f1os hipotiroideos cong\u00e9nitos, sin discapacidad mental, presentaron defectos cognitivos leves, que deben ser tenidos en cuenta para su atenci\u00f3n integral.", "To examine the psychosocial outcomes and impact of attention problems in survivors of pediatric brain tumor.\nThe survivors' cognitive functioning was measured using the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children. The Child Behavior Checklist-Attention Problems scale was used to screen for attention problems, and participants were classified as having attention problems (n=15) or normal attention (n=36). Psychosocial functioning was examined with the Korean Personality Rating scale for Children (K-PRC) at precraniospinal radiation and at 2-year follow-up.\nThe attention problem group showed significantly higher depression and externalizing symptoms (delinquency, hyperactivity) and more significant impairment in family relationships than did the normal attention group at baseline. At follow-up, the attention problem group demonstrated significantly more delinquency and impaired family and social relationships. With the K-PRC scores, except for the somatization, social relationship subscale, there were significant differences between groups, but not in terms of treatment by time interaction or within time. At follow-up, multiple linear regressions showed that age at diagnosis significantly predicted K-PRC somatization (B=-1.7, P=0.004) and social relationships (B=-1.7, P=0.004), baseline full-scale intelligence quotient predicted K-PRC depression (B=-0.4, P=0.032) and somatization (B=-0.3, P=0.015), and attention problems at baseline predicted K-PRC depression (B=-15.2, P=0.036) and social relationships (B=-11.6, P=0.016).\nPediatric brain tumor survivors, in particular, patients with attention problems, had worse psychosocial functioning at baseline and follow-up. Attention problems at baseline need to be carefully evaluated in assessing psychosocial functioning of pediatric brain tumor survivors.", "Suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) exerts marked anticancer effects via promotion of apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, and prevention of oncogene expression. In this study, serum metabolomics and artificial intelligence recognition were used to investigate SAHA toxicity. Forty rats (220 \u00b1 20 g) were randomly divided into control and three SAHA groups (low, medium, and high); the experimental groups were treated with 12.3, 24.5, or 49.0 mg kg-1 SAHA once a day via intragastric administration. After 7 days, blood samples from the four groups were collected and analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and pathological changes in the liver were examined using microscopy. The results showed that increased levels of urea, oleic acid, and glutaconic acid were the most significant indicators of toxicity. Octadecanoic acid, pentadecanoic acid, glycerol, propanoic acid, and uric acid levels were lower in the high SAHA group. Microscopic observation revealed no obvious damage to the liver. Based on these data, a support vector machine (SVM) discrimination model was established that recognized the metabolic changes in the three SAHA groups and the control group with 100% accuracy. In conclusion, the main toxicity caused by SAHA was due to excessive metabolism of saturated fatty acids, which could be recognized by an SVM model.", "To evaluate the incidence and severity of the impairment of selected cognitive functions in patients after sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) in comparison to patients after myocardial infarction without SCA and healthy subjects and to analyze the influence of sociodemographic and clinical parameters and the duration of cardiac arrest on the presence and severity of the described disorders.\nThe study group comprised 30 cardiac arrest survivors, the reference group comprised 31 survivors of myocardial infarction without cardiac arrest, and the control group comprised 30 healthy subjects. The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), the Digit Span test from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, Lauretta Bender's Visual-Motor Gestalt Test, and the Benton Visual Retention Test (BVRT) were used to assess the presence of cognitive impairment. An original questionnaire developed by the author was used for overall mental state assessment.\nThe Bender test demonstrated a significant difference in the presence and severity of visual-motor skills between the study group and the control group, while BVRT and MMSE revealed increased incidence of cognitive impairment in the study group. The Bender and BVRT (D/D)/SS (version D, method D, scaled score) scales indicated cognitive impairment in 53.3% of these patients, while the BVRT (C/A)/SS test indicated cognitive impairment in 40%. For the reference group, the values were 32.3% and 12.9%, respectively. No correlation was found between the severity of cognitive impairment and the duration of cardiac arrest.\nImpairment of visual-motor skills, short-term visual memory, concentration, and visual-motor coordination occurs much more frequently and is more severe in individuals after SCA than in healthy individuals. Impairment of memory trace storage and recall after delay occurs more frequently in patients after SCA than in patients after myocardial infarction without cardiac arrest and in healthy individuals. SCA duration did not have any influence on the severity of the described disorders.\nOcena cz\u0119sto\u015bci wyst\u0119powania i nasilenia zaburze\u0144 wybranych funkcji poznawczych u pacjent\u00f3w po nag\u0142ym zatrzymaniu kr\u0105\u017cenia (NZK) w odniesieniu do os\u00f3b po przebytym zawale mi\u0119\u015bnia sercowego bez NZK i os\u00f3b zdrowych oraz analiza wp\u0142ywu niekt\u00f3rych parametr\u00f3w socjodemograficznych i klinicznych oraz czasu trwania NZK na obecno\u015b\u0107 i nasilenie opisywanych zaburze\u0144 poznawczych.\nGrup\u0119 badan\u0105 utworzy\u0142o 30 os\u00f3b po NZK, grup\u0119 odniesienia \u2013 31 os\u00f3b po zawale serca bez NZK, a grup\u0119 kontroln\u0105 \u2013 30 os\u00f3b zdrowych.

This study examined the relationships among the decision making and independent functioning components of DI, verbal intelligence, and academic achievement within this population. Using data from 60 girls in residential juvenile justice facilities, multiple regression analyses indicated that verbal IQ moderated the relationship between the DI construct of decision making and academic achievement. Self-reported school attendance and number of previous arrests did not significantly mediate the relationship between DI and academic achievement. These results may indicate that the decision-making factor of DI may be particularly important, and, if results are replicated, future intervention efforts could focus more on improving this skill within this juvenile justice population. Additionally, the overall importance of the full DI construct is an important area of future study.", "Classical ethology and behavioral ecology did not pay much attention to learning. However, studies of social learning in nature reviewed here reveal the near-ubiquity of reliance on social information for skill acquisition by developing birds and mammals. This conclusion strengthens the plausibility of the cultural intelligence hypothesis for the evolution of intelligence, which assumes that selection on social learning abilities automatically improves individual learning ability. Thus, intelligent species will generally be cultural species. Direct tests of the cultural intelligence hypothesis require good estimates of the amount and kind of social learning taking place in nature in a broad variety of species. These estimates are lacking so far. Here, we start the process of developing a functional classification of social learning, in the form of the social learning spectrum, which should help to predict the mechanisms of social learning involved. Once validated, the categories can be used to estimate the cognitive demands of social learning in the wild.", "Schizophrenia and affective psychoses are both associated with impaired social functioning, but the extent to which childhood behavioral impairments are present prior to onset of illness is less well studied. Moreover, the concurrent relationship of childhood behavior problems and premorbid IQ with subsequent psychotic disorder has not been established. We investigated whether childhood behavior problems are associated with increased risk for adult schizophrenia or affective psychosis, independently and in combination with IQ. The study included individuals with schizophrenia (N=47), affective psychoses (N=45) and non-psychotic controls (N=1496) from the New England Family Study. Behavior problems were prospectively assessed from standardized clinician observations at ages 4 and 7. IQ was assessed with the Stanford-Binet at age 4 and the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children at age 7. We found externalizing problems at age 4 and externalizing and internalizing problems at age 7 were associated with later schizophrenia, and both internalizing and externalizing problems at ages 4 and 7 were associated with later development of affective psychoses. Lower IQ at ages 4 and 7 was associated with schizophrenia, while lower IQ was associated with affective psychoses at age 7 only. Examined simultaneously, both lower IQ and behavior problems remained associated with risk of schizophrenia, while only behavior problems remained associated with affective psychoses. Behavior problems appear to be a general marker of risk of adult psychotic disorder, while lower childhood IQ is more specific to risk of schizophrenia. Future research should clarify the premorbid evolution of behavior and cognitive problems into adult psychosis.", "This study aimed to explore the association between periconceptional fish consumption by parents and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and intelligence deficiency (ID).\nA case-control study was conducted through a questionnaire with 108 ASD cases, 79 ID cases, and 108 controls. The ASD and ID cases were students from special educational schools in Tianjin from 2012 to 2014. The age- and sex-matched controls were from a high school, three primary schools, and a kindergarten in Tianjin. Multivariate logistic regression was performed.\nPaternal habit of eating hairtail before fertilization, maternal preference for fruits during pregnancy, and maternal habit of eating grass carp during pregnancy were preventive factors for ASD. Paternal habit of drinking alcohol before fertilization was a risk factor for ID, whereas maternal preference for fruits during pregnancy and maternal habit of eating crucian carp during pregnancy were protective factors for ID.\nParental fish consumption is beneficial for the prevention of ASD and ID. Meanwhile, the protective effects of fish consumption on ASD and ID differ. More attention should be paid to the combined effect of other food when eating fish.", "Borderline intellectual functioning (BIF) is a descriptive v-code that is often used, especially in forensic settings, as if it were a full-fledged disorder. Various historical and other aspects of this classification are reviewed, and commentary is made on the question of whether to upgrade BIF to a regular psychiatric category, or to eliminate it by folding it into an already recently expanded category of intellectual developmental disorder (IDD).\nFull-scale intelligence quotient (IQ) is an outmoded concept that is decreasingly being used. For example, DSM-5 states that measures of 'executive functioning' (reasoning, planning, consequential thinking, attention, self-regulation, and so on) are often more meaningful that full-scale IQ as diagnostic indicators of IDD. Even the definition of BIF in DSM-5 no longer specifies an IQ score range.\nBIF is a descriptive v-code (rather than a typical psychiatric category), which started out as a sub-type of IDD (formerly mental retardation or intellectual disability) but morphed into its current status when the IQ ceiling for IDD was changed from minus one standard deviation (85) to minus two standard deviations (70). It has been suggested that, as people with BIF often have adjustment problems, the BIF category be elevated to the status of a formal psychiatric disorder. In this article, a contrary opinion is expressed, namely that the BIF category be dropped.", "Electronic medical records (EMR) have been implemented in many organizations to improve the quality of care. Evidence supporting the value added to a recovery-oriented mental health facility is lacking.\nThe goal of this project was to implement and customize a fully integrated EMR system in a specialized, recovery-oriented mental health care facility. This evaluation examined the outcomes of quality improvement initiatives driven by the EMR to determine the value that the EMR brought to the organization.\nThe setting was a tertiary-level mental health facility in Ontario, Canada. Clinical informatics and decision support worked closely with point-of-care staff to develop workflows and documentation tools in the EMR. The primary initiatives were implementation of modules for closed loop medication administration, collaborative plan of care, clinical practice guidelines for schizophrenia, restraint minimization, the infection prevention and control surveillance status board, drug of abuse screening, and business intelligence.\nMedication and patient scan rates have been greater than 95% since April 2014, mitigating the adverse effects of medication errors. Specifically, between April 2014 and March 2015, only 1 moderately severe and 0 severe adverse drug events occurred. The number of restraint incidents decreased 19.7%, which resulted in cost savings of more than Can $1.4 million (US $1.0 million) over 2 years. Implementation of clinical practice guidelines for schizophrenia increased adherence to evidence-based practices, standardizing care across the facility. Improved infection prevention and control surveillance reduced the number of outbreak days from 47 in the year preceding implementation of the status board to 7 days in the year following. Decision support to encourage preferential use of the cost-effective drug of abuse screen when clinically indicated resulted in organizational cost savings.\nEMR implementation allowed Ontario Shores Centre for Mental Health Sciences to use data analytics to identify and select appropriate quality improvement initiatives, supporting patient-centered, recovery-oriented practices and providing value at the clinical, organizational, and societal levels.", "Two decades of human neuroimaging research have associated volume reductions in the hippocampus with posttraumatic stress disorder. However, little is known about the distribution of volume loss across hippocampal subfields. Recent advances in neuroimaging methods have made it possible to accurately delineate 10 gray matter hippocampal subfields. Here, we apply a volumetric analysis of hippocampal subfields to data from a group of combat-exposed Veterans.\nVeterans (total, n = 68, posttraumatic stress disorder, n = 36; combat control, n = 32) completed high-resolution structural magnetic resonance imaging. Based on previously validated methods, hippocampal subfield volume measurements were conducted using FreeSurfer 6.0. The Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale assessed posttraumatic stress disorder symptom severity; Beck Depression Inventory assessed depressive symptom severity. Controlling for age and intracranial volume, partial correlation analysis examined the relationship between hippocampal subfields and symptom severity. Correction for multiple comparisons was performed using false discovery rate. Gender, intelligence, combat severity, comorbid anxiety, alcohol/substance use disorder, and medication status were investigated as potential confounds.\nIn the whole sample, total hippocampal volume negatively correlated with Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale and Beck Depression Inventory scores. Of the 10 hippocampal subfields, Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale symptom severity negatively correlated with the hippocampus-amygdala transition area (HATA). Beck Depression Inventory scores negatively correlated with dentate gyrus, cornu ammonis 4 (CA4), HATA, CA2/3, molecular layer, and CA1. Follow-up analysis limited to the posttraumatic stress disorder group showed a negative correlation between Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale symptom severity and each of HATA, CA2/3, molecular layer, and CA4.\nThis study provides the first evidence relating posttraumatic stress disorder and depression symptoms to abnormalities in the HATA, an anterior hippocampal region highly connected to prefrontal-amygdala circuitry. Notably, dentate gyrus abnormalities were associated with depression severity but not posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms. Future confirmatory studies should determine the extent to which dentate gyrus volume can differentiate between posttraumatic stress disorder- and depression-related pathophysiology.", "With a massive influx of multimodality data, the role of data analytics in health informatics has grown rapidly in the last decade. This has also prompted increasing interests in the generation of analytical, data driven models based on machine learning in health informatics. Deep learning, a technique with its foundation in artificial neural networks, is emerging in recent years as a powerful tool for machine learning, promising to reshape the future of artificial intelligence. Rapid improvements in computational power, fast data storage, and parallelization have also contributed to the rapid uptake of the technology in addition to its predictive power and ability to generate automatically optimized high-level features and semantic interpretation from the input data. This article presents a comprehensive up-to-date review of research employing deep learning in health informatics, providing a critical analysis of the relative merit, and potential pitfalls of the technique as well as its future outlook. The paper mainly focuses on key applications of deep learning in the fields of translational bioinformatics, medical imaging, pervasive sensing, medical informatics, and public health.", "Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep has been shown to be related to many adaptive cognitive and behavioral functions. However, its precise functions are still elusive, particularly in developmental psychiatric disorders. The present study aims at investigating associations between polysomnographic (PSG) REM sleep measurements and neurobehavioral functions in children with common developmental psychiatric conditions compared to typically developing children (TDC). Twenty-four children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), 21 with Tourette syndrome/tic disorder (TD), 21 with ADHD/TD comorbidity, and 22 TDC, matched for age and gender, underwent a two-night PSG, and their psychopathological scores and intelligence quotient (IQ) were assessed. Major PSG findings showed more REM sleep and shorter REM latency in the children with psychiatric disorders than in the TDC. Multiple regression analyses revealed that in groups with developmental psychopathology, REM sleep proportion correlated positively with scores of inattention and negatively with performance IQ. In contrast, in the group of TDC, REM sleep proportion correlated negatively with scores of inattention and positively with performance IQ. Whilst shorter REM latency was associated with greater inattention scores in children with psychopathology, no such an association existed in the group of TDC. Altogether, these results indicate an opposite impact of REM sleep on neurobehavioral functioning, related to presence or absence of developmental psychiatric disorders. Our findings suggest that during development, REM sleep functions may interact dissimilarly with different pathways of brain maturation.", "Intertumor heterogeneity has been proposed as a potential mechanism to account for variability in cognitive performance in women diagnosed with breast cancer. The purpose of this study was to explore associations between variation in pathologic tumor features (PTFs) and variability in preadjuvant therapy cognitive performance in postmenopausal women newly diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer. Participants (N\u00a0=\u00a0329) completed a comprehensive battery of neuropsychological tests to evaluate cognitive performance after primary surgery but prior to initiation of adjuvant anastrozole\u00b1chemotherapy. PTF data were abstracted from medical records. Robust multiple linear regression models were fit to estimate associations between individual PTFs and the cognitive function composite domain scores. All models controlled for age, estimated intelligence, and levels of depressive symptoms, anxiety, fatigue, and pain. Diagnosis of a HER2-positive tumor contributed to poorer verbal (b\u00a0=\u00a0-0.287, P\u00a0=\u00a00.018), visual (b\u00a0=\u00a0-0.270, P\u00a0=\u00a00.001), and visual working (b\u00a0=\u00a0-0.490, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) memory performance compared to diagnosis of a HER2-negative tumor. Similarly, as HER2 immunohistochemistry classification score increased, verbal (b\u00a0=\u00a0-0.072, P\u00a0=\u00a00.093), visual (b\u00a0=\u00a0-0.081, P\u00a0=\u00a00.003), and visual working (b\u00a0=\u00a0-0.170, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) memory performance score decreased. Associations with performance were also noted between location, focality/centricity, hormone receptor expression, cellular proliferation (i.e., Ki67), and Oncotype DX\u00ae Breast Cancer Assay Recurrence Score\u00ae .) Our results suggest that certain PTFs related to more aggressive tumor phenotypes or inferior breast cancer prognosis may be implicated in poorer preadjuvant therapy cognitive performance. Follow-up studies that include a cognitive assessment before primary surgery should be conducted to further delineate the role of intertumor heterogeneity on cognitive performance.", "To examine the relationship of polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) in breast milk with children's IQ.\nIn the French Etude des D\u00e9terminants pr\u00e9- et postnatals pr\u00e9coces du d\u00e9veloppement et de la sant\u00e9 de l'Enfant (EDEN) mother-child cohort, colostrum samples were collected at the maternity unit. Colostrum omega-6 and omega-3 PUFA were analyzed by gas chromatography. At age 5-6 years, the IQs of 1080 children were assessed using the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence-III. The relationships of breastfeeding duration and PUFA levels with children's IQs were examined by linear regression.\nFull scale IQ of ever breastfed children was 4.5 (95% CI: 2.7, 6.2) higher than never breastfed children in the unadjusted model, but this was not statistically significant in the adjusted model (1.3 points higher [-0.4, 3.0]). Any breastfeeding duration was associated with full scale (0.20 [0.00, 0.41] points/month) and verbal (0.31 [0.09, 0.52]) IQ. Colostrum linoleic acid (LA) levels were negatively associated with Verbal IQ (-0.6 [-1.1, 0.0] points per 1% level increase). Children exposed to colostrum high in LA and low in docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) had lower IQs than those exposed to colostrum high in DHA (3.0 [0.5, 5.5] points) and those exposed to colostrum low in LA and DHA (4.4 [1.6, 7.3] points). Finally, the association between breastfeeding duration and child IQ was stronger when LA levels were high.\nDuration of breastfeeding and colostrum PUFA levels were associated with children's IQs in the EDEN cohort. These data support breastfeeding and add evidence for the role of early PUFA exposure on childhood cognition.", "We present a rationale for expanding the presence of the Lisp family of programming languages in bioinformatics and computational biology research. Put simply, Lisp-family languages enable programmers to more quickly write programs that run faster than in other languages. Languages such as Common Lisp, Scheme and Clojure facilitate the creation of powerful and flexible software that is required for complex and rapidly evolving domains like biology. We will point out several important key features that distinguish languages of the Lisp family from other programming languages, and we will explain how these features can aid researchers in becoming more productive and creating better code. We will also show how these features make these languages ideal tools for artificial intelligence and machine learning applications. We will specifically stress the advantages of domain-specific languages (DSLs): languages that are specialized to a particular area, and thus not only facilitate easier research problem formulation, but also aid in the establishment of standards and best programming practices as applied to the specific research field at hand. DSLs are particularly easy to build in Common Lisp, the most comprehensive Lisp dialect, which is commonly referred to as the 'programmable programming language'. We are convinced that Lisp grants programmers unprecedented power to build increasingly sophisticated artificial intelligence systems that may ultimately transform machine learning and artificial intelligence research in bioinformatics and computational biology.", "The theory of graphs are very useful tool in solving the combinatorial problems in different areas of computer science and computational intelligence systems. In this paper, we present a frame work to handle m-polar fuzzy information by combining the theory of m-polar fuzzy sets with graphs. We introduce the notion of weak self complement m-polar fuzzy graphs and establish a necessary condition for m-polar fuzzy graph to be weak self complement. Some properties of self complement and weak self complement m-polar fuzzy graphs are discussed. The order, size, busy vertices and free vertices of an m-polar fuzzy graphs are also defined and proved that isomorphic m-polar fuzzy graphs have same order, size and degree. Also, we have presented some results of busy vertices in isomorphic and weak isomorphic m-polar fuzzy graphs. Finally, a relative study of complement and operations on m-polar fuzzy graphs have been made. Applications of m-polar fuzzy graph are also given at the end.", "The cognitive profile differences between adult patients with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and those with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are not well characterized. We examined the cognitive profiles of adults having either ASD (n=120) or ADHD (n=76) with no intellectual disabilities (IQ\u226570) using the Wechsler Intelligence Scale III (WAIS-III). Verbal Intelligence (VIQ) - Performance Intelligence (PIQ) difference discrepancies were detected between the two groups. Information subtest scores of the Verbal Comprehension index and Arithmetic and Digit Span subtests of the Freedom from Distractibility index were significantly higher in ASD than in ADHD, while the Picture Completion subtest was significantly lower in ASD. To our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate the difference in the cognitive profiles of adults with ASD and those with ADHD based on the WAIS III with a large number of participants.", "This study investigates the relationship between intelligence and individual differences in children's moral development across a range of different moral transgressions. Taking up prior research that showed morality and intelligence to be related in adolescents and adults, the current study wants to test if these findings can be extended to younger children. The study was designed to address some of the shortcomings in prior research by examining young children aged between 6 years; 4 months and 8 years; 10 months, using a broad concept of moral development including emotional aspects and applying an approach that is closely connected to children's daily lives. Participants (N = 129) completed a standardized intelligence test and were presented four moral transgression stories to assess moral development. Results demonstrated that findings from prior research with adolescents or adults cannot simply be extended to younger participants. No significant correlations of moral development and intelligence were found for any of the presented stories. This provides first evidence that - at least in middle childhood - moral developmental status seems to be independent from children's general intelligence assessed by figural inductive reasoning tests.", "The Internet is an important focus of attention for the philosophy of mind and cognitive science communities. This is partly because the Internet serves as an important part of the material environment in which a broad array of human cognitive and epistemic activities are situated. The Internet can thus be seen as an important part of the 'cognitive ecology' that helps to shape, support and (on occasion) realize aspects of human cognizing. Much of the previous philosophical work in this area has sought to analyze the cognitive significance of the Internet from the perspective of human cognition. There has, as such, been little effort to assess the cognitive significance of the Internet from the perspective of 'machine cognition'. This is unfortunate, because the Internet is likely to exert a significant influence on the shape of machine intelligence. The present paper attempts to evaluate the extent to which the Internet serves as a form of cognitive ecology for synthetic (machine-based) forms of intelligence. In particular, the phenomenon of Internet-situated machine intelligence is analyzed from the perspective of a number of approaches that are typically subsumed under the heading of situated cognition. These include extended, embedded, scaffolded and embodied approaches to cognition. For each of these approaches, the Internet is shown to be of potential relevance to the development and operation of machine-based cognitive capabilities. Such insights help us to appreciate the role of the Internet in advancing the current state-of-the-art in machine intelligence.", "22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2 DS) is characterized by cardiac defects, abnormal facial features, thymic hypoplasia, cleft palate, and hypocalcemia, including DiGeorge syndrome (DGS), velocardiofacial syndrome (VCFS), and conotruncal anomaly face (CTAF) syndrome. Psychiatric symptoms were recently shown to be very common in patients with 22q11.2 DS, prompting greater interest in this syndrome. Early diagnosis during childhood based on a con- stellation of physical features is optimal ; however, as some patients remain undiagnosed until the presentation of other symptoms in adult life, psychiatrists are well advised to familiarize themselves with basic information concerning 22q11.2 DS. A 25-year-old woman presenting with auditory hallucinations was referred to A hospital for examination and treatment. Her family history revealed both paternal and maternal rela- tives with schizophrenia. At birth, she presented a cleft palate and ventricular septum defect. She first became ambulatory at age 4 and became verbal a year later. Her intelligence quotient was estimated at around 40 and mental retardation (DSM-IV) with autistic features was diag- nosed at age 7. After graduating from a special high school, she obtained fulltime employment in a workshop. However, auditory hallucinations began disrupting her life from 22 years of age. Although olanzapine temporarily alleviated her symptoms, the resultant extrapyramidal symp- toms worsened and she was referred to A hospital again at age 25. The patient presented with micrognathia and a flat nasal root and spoke a maximum of 3 words per sentence in a very high and indistinct tone. A cardiac defect (ventricular septal defect), scoliosis, and low platelets were also observed. The diagnosis of 22qll.2 DS was confirmed using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). The patient and her family were subsequently introduced to a 22q11.2 DS patients' support group. Careful genetic counseling is paramount, but the diagnosis of 22q11.2 DS can make updated information, official aid, and access to support groups available to patients and their family. Emergency complications such as seizures due to hypocalcemia can also be anticipated. The comparatively late diagnosis of 22q11.2 DS in our patient, which went undetected until the presentation of auditory hallucinations, in the context of mental retardation with autis- tic features (DSM-IV) underscores the importance of detailed clinical observation. \"One rare variant\" possibly points out the essence of psychiatric pathophysiology. Moreover, 22q11.2 DS has been listed as an intractable disease in Japan since 2015. When patients present with neurodevelopmental disorders and schizophrenic symptoms, we should carefully observe their physical features for clues to the possible diagnosis of 22q11.2 DS.", "Is academic performance in adolescents aged 15-16 years and conceived after ART, measured as test scores in ninth grade, comparable to that for spontaneously conceived (SC) adolescents?\nART singletons had a significantly lower mean test score in the adjusted analysis when compared with SC singletons, yet the differences were small and probably not of clinical relevance.\nPrevious studies have shown similar intelligence quotient (IQ) levels in ART and SC children, but only a few have been on adolescents. Academic performance measured with standardized national tests has not previously been explored in a complete national cohort of adolescents conceived after ART.\nA Danish national registry-based cohort including all 4766 ART adolescents (n = 2836 singletons and n = 1930 twins) born in 1995-1998 were compared with two SC control cohorts: a randomly selected singleton population (n = 5660) and all twins (n = 7064) born from 1995 to 1998 in Denmark. Nine children who died during the follow-up period were excluded from the study.\nMean test scores on a 7-point-marking scale from -3 to 12 were compared, and adjustments were made for relevant reproductive and socio-demographic covariates including occupational and educational level of the parents.\nThe crude mean test score was higher in both ART singletons and ART twins compared with SC adolescents. The crude mean differences were +0.41 (95% CI 0.30-0.53) and +0.45 (95% CI 0.28-0.62) between ART and SC singletons and between ART and SC twins, respectively. However, the adjusted mean overall test score was significantly lower for ART singletons compared with SC singletons (adjusted mean difference -0.15 (95% CI -0.29-(-0.02))). For comparison, the adjusted mean difference was +2.05 (95% CI 1.82-2.28) between the highest and the lowest parental educational level, suggesting that the effect of ART is weak compared with the conventional predictors. The adjusted analyses showed significantly lower mean test scores in mathematics and physics/chemistry for ART singletons compared with SC singletons. Comparing ART twins with SC twins yielded no difference in academic performance in the adjusted analyses. Similar crude and adjusted overall mean test scores were found when comparing ART singletons and ART twins.\nMissing data on educational test scores occurred in 6.6% of adolescents aged 15-16 years for the birth cohorts 1995-1997, where all of the children according to their age should have passed the ninth grade exam at the time of data retrieval. As sensitivity analyses yielded no significant difference in the adjusted risk of having missing test scores between any of the groups, it is unlikely that this should bias our results. Adjustment for body mass index and smoking during pregnancy was not possible.\nAs our results are based on national data, our findings can be applied to other populations. The findings of this paper suggest that a possible small negative effect of parental subfertility or ART treatment is counterbalanced by the higher educational level in the ART parents.\nThe Danish Medical Association in Copenhagen (KMS) funded this study with a scholarship grant. None of the authors had any competing interests.\n704676.", "This study was conducted to investigate the neurocognitive functioning of children with intracranial germ cell tumor (IGCT) prior to receiving proton beam therapy (PBT), and to identify differential characteristics of their neurocognitive functioning depending on tumor location. As a secondary object of this study, neurocognitive functions were followed up at 1-2 years after PBT to examine early post-treatment changes.\nBetween 2008 and 2014, 34 childrenwith IGCT treatedwho received PBT atNational Cancer Center, Korea were enrolled in this study. Standardized neurocognitive tests of intelligence, memory, and executive functioning were performed with baseline psychological assessments using the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). Follow-up assessments after PBT were conducted in 20 patients (T2). The results were analyzed based on the locations of tumors, which included the suprasellar, pineal gland, basal ganglia, and bifocal regions.\nThe neurocognitive function of IGCT patients was significantly lower than that of the normal population in performance intelligence quotient (p=0.041), processing speed (p=0.007), memory (p < 0.001), and executive functioning (p=0.010). Patients with basal ganglia tumors had significantly lower scores for most domains of neurocognitive functioning and higher scores for CBCL than both the normal population and patients with IGCT in other locations. There was no significant change in neurocognitive function between T1 and T2 for all types of IGCT patients in first 1-2 years after PBT.\nTumor location significantly affects the neuropsychological functioning in patients with IGCT. Neuropsychological functioning should be closely monitored from the time of diagnosis in IGCT patients.", "The current research evaluated the potential utility of a 360-degree survey feedback program for measuring leadership quality in potential committee leaders of a professional medical association (PMA). Emotional intelligence as measured by the extent to which self-other agreement existed in the 360-degree survey ratings was explored as a key predictor of leadership quality in the potential leaders.\nA non-experimental correlational survey design was implemented to assess the variation in leadership quality scores across the sample of potential leaders. A total of 63 of 86 (76%) of those invited to participate did so. All potential leaders received feedback from PMA Leadership, PMA Colleagues, and PMA Staff and were asked to complete self-ratings regarding their behavior.\nAnalyses of variance revealed a consistent pattern of results as Under-Estimators and Accurate Estimators-Favorable were rated significantly higher than Over-Estimators in several leadership behaviors.\nEmotional intelligence as conceptualized in this study was positively related to overall performance ratings of potential leaders. The ever-increasing roles and potential responsibilities for PMAs suggest that these organizations should consider multisource performance reviews as these potential future PMA executives rise through their organizations to assume leadership positions with profound potential impact on healthcare. The current findings support the notion that potential leaders who demonstrated a humble pattern or an accurate pattern of self-rating scored significantly higher in their leadership, teamwork, and interpersonal/communication skills than those with an aggrandizing self-rating.", "Two out of six strategic axes of pharmaceutical care in our hospital are quality and safety of care, and the incorporation of information technologies. Based on this, an information system was developed in the outpatient setting for pharmaceutical care of patients with chronic hepatitis C, SiMON-VC, which would improve the quality and safety of their pharmacotherapy. The objective of this paper is to describe requirements, structure and features of Si- MON-VC. Requirements demanded were that the information system would enter automatically all critical data from electronic clinical records at each of the visits to the Outpatient Pharmacy Unit, allowing the generation of events and alerts, documenting the pharmaceutical care provided, and allowing the use of data for research purposes. In order to meet these requirements, 5 sections were structured for each patient in SiMON-VC: Main Record, Events, Notes, Monitoring Graphs and Tables, and Follow-up. Each section presents a number of tabs with those coded data needed to monitor patients in the outpatient unit. The system automatically generates alerts for assisted prescription validation, efficacy and safety of using antivirals for the treatment of this disease. It features a completely versatile Indicator Control Panel, where temporary monitoring standards and alerts can be set. It allows the generation of reports, and their export to the electronic clinical record. It also allows data to be exported to the usual operating systems, through Big Data and Business Intelligence. Summing up, we can state that SiMON-VC improves the quality of pharmaceutical care provided in the outpatient pharmacy unit to patients with chronic hepatitis C, increasing the safety of antiviral therapy.\nDos ejes estrat\u00e9gicos de la atenci\u00f3n farmac\u00e9utica en nuestro hospital son la calidad y seguridad asistencial y la incorporaci\u00f3n de tecnolog\u00edas de la informaci\u00f3n. En base a ellos, en el \u00e1mbito de pacientes externos, se desarroll\u00f3 un sistema de informaci\u00f3n para la atenci\u00f3n farmac\u00e9utica de pacientes con hepatitis C cr\u00f3nica, SiMON-VC, que mejorase la calidad y seguridad de su farmacoterapia. El objetivo de este trabajo es describir requisitos, estructura y prestaciones de SiMON-VC. Los requisitos exigidos fueron que el sistema de informaci\u00f3n incorpore autom\u00e1ticamente datos cr\u00edticos desde la historia cl\u00ednica electr\u00f3nica en cada una de las visitas a consulta externa de Farmacia, que permita la generaci\u00f3n de eventos y alertas, que documente la atenci\u00f3n farmac\u00e9utica proporcionada y que posibilite la explotaci\u00f3n de los datos con fines de investigaci\u00f3n. Para cumplir estos requisitos SiMON-VC se estructuraron 5 apartados para cada paciente: Registro Principal, Eventos, Notas, Gr\u00e1fica y Tablas de Seguimiento y Seguimientos. Cada apartado dispone de una serie de pesta\u00f1as con datos codificados necesarios para el seguimiento del paciente en consulta externa. El sistema genera autom\u00e1ticamente alertas de efectividad y seguridad de la utilizaci\u00f3n de antivirales para el tratamiento de esta patolog\u00eda y como sistema de ayuda a la validaci\u00f3n farmac\u00e9utica de la prescripci\u00f3n m\u00e9dica. Incorpora un Cuadro de Mando de Indicadores totalmente vers\u00e1til, para el que se pueden definir est\u00e1ndares y alertas de seguimiento temporales.

Posibilita la exportaci\u00f3n de los datos a los sistemas de explotaci\u00f3n habituales, con fines de investigaci\u00f3n a trav\u00e9s de Big-Data y Business Intelligence. Como conclusi\u00f3n se puede indicar que SiMON-VC mejora la calidad de la atenci\u00f3n farmac\u00e9utica proporcionada en consulta externa de Farmacia a pacientes con hepatitis C cr\u00f3nica, incrementando la seguridad del tratamiento antiviral.", "For enteric disease outbreaks, effective control depends on timely intervention. Routine collection of metrics related to outbreak identification, investigation and control can help evaluate and improve interventions and inform further analyses and modelling of intervention effectiveness.\nTo analyze data from enteric disease outbreaks in British Columbia, generate outbreak metrics and assess their use in evaluating the impact of outbreak interventions.\nThis descriptive study analyzed data from 57 provincial and national enteric disease outbreak investigations involving the British Columbia Centre for Disease Control from 2005 to 2014. Data were extracted from internal files and the Canadian Network for Public Health Intelligence. Outbreak metrics analyzed included days to initiate investigation, days to intervention, number and type of interventions, duration of investigation, duration of outbreak and the total number of cases.\nThe median time to initiate an outbreak investigation was 36 days and the median duration of investigations was 39 days. The median duration of outbreaks was 40 days and the median time to intervene was 10 days. Identification of the source was associated with use of one or more interventions (P<0.0001). The duration of outbreaks was correlated with the number of days to initiate an investigation (rs =0.72, P<0.0001) and number of days to intervene (rs =0.51, P=0.025).\nIdentification and analysis of outbreak metrics establishes benchmarks that can be compared to other jurisdictions. This may support continuous quality improvement and enhance understanding of the impact of public health activities. Date information for public health actions is essential for evaluating the timing and effectiveness of outbreak interventions.", "The Cognitive reserve (CR) hypothesis was put forward to account for the variability in cognitive performance of patients with similar degrees of brain pathology. Compensatory neural activity within the frontal lobes has often been associated with CR. For the first time we investigated the independent effects of two CR proxies, education and NART IQ, on measures of executive function, fluid intelligence, speed of information processing, verbal short term memory (vSTM), naming, and perception in a sample of 86 patients with focal, unilateral frontal lesions and 142 healthy controls. We fitted multiple linear regression models for each of the cognitive measures and found that only NART IQ predicted executive and naming performance. Neither education nor NART IQ predicted performance on fluid intelligence, processing speed, vSTM or perceptual abilities. Education and NART IQ did not modify the effect of lesion severity on cognitive impairment. We also found that age significantly predicted performance on executive tests and the majority of our other cognitive measures, except vSTM and GNT. Age was the only predictor for fluid intelligence. This latter finding suggests that age plays a role in executive performance over and above the contribution of CR proxies in patients with focal frontal lesions. Overall, our results suggest that the CR proxies do not appear to modify the relationship between cognitive impairment and frontal lesions.", "Humour processing is a complex information-processing task that is dependent on cognitive and emotional aspects which presumably influence frame-shifting and conceptual blending, mental operations that underlie humour processing. The aim of the current study was to find distinctive groups of subjects with respect to black humour processing, intellectual capacities, mood disturbance and aggressiveness. A total of 156 adults rated black humour cartoons and conducted measurements of verbal and nonverbal intelligence, mood disturbance and aggressiveness. Cluster analysis yields three groups comprising following properties: (1) moderate black humour preference and moderate comprehension; average nonverbal and verbal intelligence; low mood disturbance and moderate aggressiveness; (2) low black humour preference and moderate comprehension; average nonverbal and verbal intelligence, high mood disturbance and high aggressiveness; and (3) high black humour preference and high comprehension; high nonverbal and verbal intelligence; no mood disturbance and low aggressiveness. Age and gender do not differ significantly, differences in education level can be found. Black humour preference and comprehension are positively associated with higher verbal and nonverbal intelligence as well as higher levels of education. Emotional instability and higher aggressiveness apparently lead to decreased levels of pleasure when dealing with black humour. These results support the hypothesis that humour processing involves cognitive as well as affective components and suggest that these variables influence the execution of frame-shifting and conceptual blending in the course of humour processing.", "For more than 40years, the uncanny valley model has captivated researchers from various fields of expertise. Still, explanations as to why slightly imperfect human-like characters can evoke feelings of eeriness remain the subject of controversy. Many experiments exploring the phenomenon have emphasized specific visual factors in connection to evolutionary psychological theories or an underlying categorization conflict. More recently, studies have also shifted away focus from the appearance of human-like entities, instead exploring their mental capabilities as basis for observers' discomfort. In order to advance this perspective, we introduced 92 participants to a virtual reality (VR) chat program and presented them with two digital characters engaged in an emotional and empathic dialogue. Using the same pre-recorded 3D scene, we manipulated the perceived control type of the depicted characters (human-controlled avatars vs. computer-controlled agents), as well as their alleged level of autonomy (scripted vs. self-directed actions). Statistical analyses revealed that participants experienced significantly stronger eeriness if they perceived the empathic characters to be autonomous artificial intelligences. As human likeness and attractiveness ratings did not result in significant group differences, we present our results as evidence for an \"uncanny valley of mind\" that relies on the attribution of emotions and social cognition to non-human entities. A possible relationship to the philosophy of anthropocentrism and its \"threat to human distinctiveness\" concept is discussed.", "In phylogenesis, carnivorous animals initially and later herbivorous animals formed separate transfer of exogenous fatty acids in blood, predominantly palmitic acid and later - endogenous oleic acid pool, synthesized in hepatocytes from glucose. In vivo, exogenous fatty acids transfer \u03b1-lipoproteins to all cells and chylomicrons to hepatocytes. The endogenous oleic fatty acid, synthesized in hepatocytes is transferred to all cells by \u03b2-lipoproteins and to insulin-dependent lipoproteins of very low density. The limitation of cognitive biological function in herbivorous animals underlies the process of transferring of surplus amount of exogenous palmitic acid and alcohol cholesterol by \u03b2-lipoproteins becoming a non-physiological one. The bio-availability is affected concerning cells of exogenous polyene fatty acids that transfer in blood \u03b1-lipoproteins in carnivorous animals and at the first stage in herbivorous animals. The formation of palmitic non-ligand very low density lipoproteins-\u03b2-proteins is affected and their collection and partial utilization in intima generates lipoidosis. In summary, all this becomes a cause of formation of atherosclerosis and atheromatosis. The limitations in phylogenesis of cognitive biological function are considered as an etiological factor of metabolic pandemics. The etiological factors are specific for every one of metabolic pandemics and pathogenesis of all pandemics is developed following common algorithm. It is likely that metabolic pandemics (atherosclerosis and atheromatosis, metabolic essential arterial hypertension, metabolic syndrome, syndrome of insulin resistance, obesity and non-alcoholic fatty disease of liver)are quite not identical to nosologic forms of diseases if considered according etiological factors, pathogenesis and pathology rate in population. The exclusion of all inherent forms of disorder of metabolism of fatty acids and their transfer in \u03b2-lipoproteins demonstrates that problem of atherosclerosis, atheromatosis, coronarosclerosis and ischemic heart disease mainly turns out to be a case of eaten one's fill , a result of environment factors impact, disorder of biological function of trophology, biological reaction of exotrophy (external nutrition) and biological function of homeostasis. The prevention of atherosclerosis, atheromatosis and ischemic heart disease in population will be effective only under condition of obligatory individual support of actioning cognitive biological function by more complete biological function of intelligence. The active prevention of metabolic pandemics by force of personal development of cognitive biological function, intelligence function, provides no application of pharmaceuticals. The disorder of cognitive biological function is needed to be improved, incorrect positioning of Homo Sapiens species as omnivorous in animal world; Homo Sapiens is a herbivorous one.", "In this rejoinder, we respond to two commentaries on the study by Greiff, S.; Stadler, M.; Sonnleitner, P.; Wolff, C.; Martin, R. Sometimes less is more: Comparing the validity of complex problem solving measures. Intelligence 2015, 50, 100-113. The study was the first to address the important comparison between a classical measure of complex problem solving (CPS) and the more recent multiple complex systems (MCS) approach regarding their validity. In the study, we investigated the relations between one classical microworld as the initially developed method (here, the Tailorshop) with three more recently developed multiple complex systems (MCS; here, MicroDYN, Genetics Lab, and MicroFIN) tests. We found that the MCS tests showed higher levels of convergent validity with each other than with the Tailorshop even after reasoning was controlled for, thus empirically distinguishing between the two approaches. The commentary by Kretzschmar and the commentary by Funke, Fischer, and Holt expressed several concerns with how our study was conducted, our data was analyzed, and our results were interpreted. Whereas we acknowledge and agree with some of the more general statements made in these commentaries, we respectfully disagree with others, or we consider them to be at least partially in contrast with the existing literature and the currently available empirical evidence.", "Understanding others' feelings, intentions, and beliefs is a crucial social skill both for our personal lives and for meeting the challenges of a globalized world. Recent evidence suggests that the ability to represent and infer others' mental states (Theory of Mind, ToM) can be enhanced by mental training in healthy adults. The present study investigated the role of training-induced understanding of oneself for the enhanced understanding of others. In a large-scale longitudinal study, two independent participant samples (N\u00a0=\u00a080 and N\u00a0=\u00a081) received a 3-month contemplative training. This training focused on perspective taking and was inspired by the Internal Family Systems model that conceives the self as being composed of a complex system of inner personality aspects. Specifically, participants practiced perspective taking on their own inner states by learning to identify and classify different inner personality parts. Results revealed that the degree to which participants improved their understanding of themselves-reflected in the number of different inner parts they could identify-predicted their improvements in high-level ToM performance over training. Especially the number of identified parts that were negatively valenced showed a strong relation with enhanced ToM capacities. This finding suggests a close link between getting better in understanding oneself and improvement in social intelligence.", "Background/Objective: Emotional intelligence is a variable which has been the subject of significantly increased research in recent years. Relationships have been shown with both physical and psychological problems. The aim of this study is to analyse the direct and indirect effect that emotional intelligence exerts over the manifestation of physical and psychological clinical symptomatology and to severe disorders such as burnout syndrome in a professional group in which social function is fundamental. Method: So that, 881 Latin-American catholic priests (M age\u00a0=\u00a045.89; SD age\u00a0=\u00a011.58) were evaluated using the Trait Meta-Mood Scale-24, the Maslach Burnout Inventory-22 and the General Health Questionnaire-28. Results: Using path analysis, emotional intelligence, especially Attention and Emotional Clarity, shows a high effect on psychological and somatic issues. Conclusions: Thus, both specific disorders and general well-being are related to emotional intelligence. Providing effective emotional intelligence training sessions seems to be able to reduce possible physical and emotional disorders.\nAntecedentes/Objetivo: La inteligencia emocional es una variable que ha sido objeto de un incremento notable de investigaci\u00f3n a lo largo de los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os. La inteligencia emocional ha mostrado numerosas relaciones con m\u00faltiples variables psicol\u00f3gicas, destacando su conexi\u00f3n con diversos trastornos f\u00edsicos y psicol\u00f3gicos. El objetivo del presente estudio es analizar los efectos directos e indirectos que la inteligencia emocional ejerce sobre la manifestaci\u00f3n de sintomatolog\u00eda som\u00e1tica y psicol\u00f3gica, as\u00ed como sobre el desarrollo de trastornos como el s\u00edndrome de burnout en un grupo de profesionales cuya labor social resulta esencial.

Despite the successful characterization of DD-susceptibility genes, we are far from understanding the molecular etiological pathways underlying the development of reading (dis)ability. By focusing mainly on clinical phenotypes, the molecular genetics approach has yielded mixed results. More optimally reduced measures of functioning, that is, intermediate phenotypes (IPs), represent a target for researching disease-associated genetic variants and for elucidating the underlying mechanisms. Imaging data provide a viable IP for complex neurobehavioral disorders and have been extensively used to investigate both morphological, structural and functional brain abnormalities in DD. Performing joint genetic and neuroimaging studies in humans is an emerging strategy to link DD-candidate genes to the brain structure and function. A limited number of studies has already pursued the imaging-genetics integration in DD. However, the results are still not sufficient to unravel the complexity of the reading circuit due to heterogeneous study design and data processing. Here, we propose an interdisciplinary, multilevel, imaging-genetic approach to disentangle the pathways from genes to behavior. As the presence of putative functional genetic variants has been provided and as genetic associations with specific cognitive/sensorial mechanisms have been reported, new hypothesis-driven imaging-genetic studies must gain momentum. This approach would lead to the optimization of diagnostic criteria and to the early identification of 'biologically at-risk' children, supporting the definition of adequate and well-timed prevention strategies and the implementation of novel, specific remediation approach.", "Vocabulary scores tend to be significantly related to education in heterogeneous groups of older adults, even after controlling for confounding variables. However, there may be other factors that impinge on cognitive functioning for certain demographic groups, particularly those whose educational opportunities were limited, and who may have experienced considerable stress as a result of their minority status.\nThis study sought to explore possible predictors of vocabulary scores among African American and White older adults.\nIn this study, samples of African American (N\u00a0=\u00a0165) and White (N\u00a0=\u00a0146) community-dwelling older adults reported their level of education, perceived health status, and number of stressful life events, and were administered the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised (WAIS-R) Vocabulary subtest.\nAmong the White participants, level of education was the only significant predictor of vocabulary score after controlling for perceived health and exposure to stress. Among African American participants, education was also a significant predictor of vocabulary score. However perceived health and number of stressful life events were also significantly predictors of vocabulary score.\nFindings indicate that for certain cohorts of older adults, especially those who may have experienced stressful life circumstances and health disparities as a result of racial inequality, education may not be the only variable that predicts verbal intelligence. The importance of investigating cognitive functioning within a broader sociocultural context is discussed.", "The Frommelt Attitude Toward Care of the Dying Scale (FATCOD) is designed to assess the attitudes of professionals and trainees toward caring for the dying patient and their family members. In this study the main aim is to adapt the FATCOD to a Spanish context (FATCOD-S). In addition, the relations between FATCOD-S, sociodemographic variables, emotional intelligence, and death attitudes have been analyzed. A sample of 669 Spanish nursing students from four Universities responded to a questionnaire. The exploratory factor analysis (EFA) concludes a structure composed of two significant factors. A confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was carried out. The CFA supported a two-factor model. Students with past experience of death and those who had received training in palliative care scored significantly higher on both factors of the FATCOD-S ( p\u2009<\u20090.01). The FATCOD-S is an effective and valid tool for measuring the attitudes of Spanish nursing students toward caring for patients at the end of life.", "Proactive interference (PI) has been shown to affect working memory (WM) span as well as the predictive utility of WM span measures. However, most of the research on PI has been conducted using verbal memory items, and much less is known about the role of PI in the visuospatial domain. In order to further explore this issue, the present study used a within-subjects manipulation of PI that alternated clusters of trials with verbal and visuospatial to-be-remembered items. Although PI was shown to build and release across trials similarly in the two domains, important differences also were observed. The ability of verbal WM to predict performance on a measure of fluid intelligence was significantly affected by the amount of PI present, consistent with past research, but this proved not to be the case for visuospatial WM. Further, individuals' susceptibility to PI in one domain was relatively independent of their susceptibility in the other domain, suggesting that, contrary to some theories of executive function, individual differences in PI susceptibility may not be domain-general.", "Knowledge is created and transmitted through generations, and innovation is often seen as a process generated from collective intelligence. There is rising interest in studying how innovation emerges from the blending of accumulated knowledge, and from which path an innovation mostly inherits. A citation network can be seen as a perfect example of one generative process leading to innovation. However, the impact and influence of scientific publication are always difficult to capture and measure. We offer a new take on investigating how the knowledge circulates and is transmitted, inspired by the notion of \"stream of knowledge\". We propose to look at this question under the lens of flows in directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). In this framework inspired by the work of Strahler, we can also account for other well known measures of influence such as the h-index. We propose then to analyze flows of influence in a citation networks as an ascending flow. From this point on, we can take a finer look at the diffusion of knowledge through the lens of a multiplex network. In this network, each citation of a specific work constitutes one layer of interaction. Within our framework, we design three measures of multiplex flows in DAGs, namely the aggregated, sum and selective flow, to better understand how citations are influenced. We conduct our experiments with the arXiv HEP-Th dataset, and find insights through the visualization of these multiplex networks.", "An association between higher intelligence and lower probability of serious depression has previously been established. Yet, to our knowledge, no large prospective study has examined the relationship across the lifespan.\nA cohort of 49,321 Swedish men was followed from conscription in 1969-70 (age 18-20) through to 2008. Odds ratios (OR) for first time hospitalisation for depression (FTHD) were calculated in relation to intelligence for distinct time periods across the lifespan, while controlling for established risk factors for depression.\nThere was a linear association between higher intelligence in youth and lower odds for FTHD during the entire follow-up period, 1973-2008. The association got progressively weaker across the lifespan. During 1973-80, one step down on the stanine scale was associated with an unadjusted increase in OR of 1.34 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.26-1.42], adjusted OR 1.23 [1.15-1.32]; while, during 2001-2008, the ORs were less than half of the magnitude of the first period, unadjusted 1.14 [1.07-1.21], and adjusted 1.09 [1.01-1.17].\nThe study includes men only, and the number of available places for in-patient care decreased during the follow-up period.\nFor the first time, we have shown that the association between lower intelligence and depression decreases over time. The attenuation of the association in the adjusted models suggests a slower accumulation of depressogenic stressors among people with a higher IQ-score. Further exploration of intelligence's role in the etiology of depression across the lifespan is required in order to facilitate adequate diagnoses and ameliorating interventions.", "Invariance of intelligence across age is often assumed but infrequently explicitly tested. Horn and McArdle (1992) tested measurement invariance of intelligence, providing adequate model fit but might not consider all relevant aspects such as sub-test differences. The goal of the current paper is to explore age-related invariance of the WAIS-R using an alternative model that allows direct tests of age on WAIS-R subtests.\nCross-sectional data on 940 participants aged 16-75 from the WAIS-R normative values were used. Subtests examined were information, comprehension, similarities, vocabulary, picture completion, block design, picture arrangement, and object assembly. The two intelligence factors considered were fluid and crystallized intelligence. Self-reported ages were divided into young (16-22, n = 300), adult (29-39, n = 275), middle (40-60, n = 205), and older (61-75, n = 160) adult groups.\nResults suggested partial metric invariance holds. Although most of the subtests reflected fluid and crystalized intelligence similarly across different ages, invariance did not hold for block design on fluid intelligence and picture arrangement on crystallized intelligence for older adults. Additionally, there was evidence of a correlated residual between information and vocabulary for the young adults only. This partial metric invariance model yielded acceptable model fit compared to previously-proposed invariance models of Horn and McArdle (1992).\nAlmost complete metric invariance holds for a two-factor model of intelligence. Most of the subtests were invariant across age groups, suggesting little evidence for age-related bias in the WAIS-R. However, we did find unique relationships between two subtests and intelligence. Future studies should examine age-related differences in subtests when testing measurement invariance in intelligence.", "Cable joint insulation breakdown may cause a huge loss to power companies. Therefore, it is vital to diagnose the insulation quality to detect early signs of insulation failure. It is well known that there is a correlation between Partial discharge (PD) and the insulation quality. Although many works have been done on PD pattern recognition, it is usually performed in a noise free environment. Also, works on PD pattern recognition in actual cable joint are less likely to be found in literature. Therefore, in this work, classifications of actual cable joint defect types from partial discharge data contaminated by noise were performed. Five cross-linked polyethylene (XLPE) cable joints with artificially created defects were prepared based on the defects commonly encountered on site. Three different types of input feature were extracted from the PD pattern under artificially created noisy environment. These include statistical features, fractal features and principal component analysis (PCA) features. These input features were used to train the classifiers to classify each PD defect types. Classifications were performed using three different artificial intelligence classifiers, which include Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). It was found that the classification accuracy decreases with higher noise level but PCA features used in SVM and ANN showed the strongest tolerance against noise contamination.", "To extend the reach and relevance of epidemiology for public health practice, the science needs be broadened beyond etiologic research, to link more strongly with emerging technologies and to acknowledge key societal transformations. This new focus for epidemiology and its implications for epidemiologic training can be considered in the context of macro trends affecting society, including a greater focus on upstream causes of disease, shifting demographics, the Affordable Care Act and health care system reform, globalization, changing health communication environment, growing centrality of team and transdisciplinary science, emergence of translational sciences, greater focus on accountability, big data, informatics, high-throughput technologies (\"omics\"), privacy changes, and the evolving funding environment. This commentary describes existing approaches to and competencies for training in epidemiology, maps macro trends with competencies, highlights an example of competency-based education in the Epidemic Intelligence Service of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and suggests expanded and more dynamic training approaches. A reexamination of current approaches to epidemiologic training is needed.", "The purpose of this study was to explore the relationships between preceptor characteristics (emotional intelligence, personality and cognitive intelligence) and new graduate nurse socialization outcomes regarding turnover intent, job satisfaction, role conflict and ambiguity during a preceptorship programme. To date, no studies have explored these relationships.\nA cross-sectional and multi-site design with purposeful sampling.\nDyads of preceptors and new nurses were recruited at the end of their preceptorship programme. Pearson's correlational analysis was used to examine the relationships.\nA sample of 41 preceptors and 44 new graduate nurses participated in this study, making 38 dyads with complete data. The preceptor personality traits of openness, conscientiousness and emotional stability were significantly related to new graduate nurses who reported greater turnover intent, job dissatisfaction, role conflict and ambiguity. No significant relationships were noted between preceptor EI and IQ and the outcome of new graduate nurses.", "To the best of our knowledge, the genetic foundations that guide human brain development have not changed fundamentally during the past 50,000 years. However, because of their cognitive potential, humans have changed the world tremendously in the past centuries. They have invented technical devices, institutions that regulate cooperation and competition, and symbol systems, such as script and mathematics, that serve as reasoning tools. The exceptional learning ability of humans allows newborns to adapt to the world they are born into; however, there are tremendous individual differences in learning ability among humans that become obvious in school at the latest. Cognitive psychology has developed models of memory and information processing that attempt to explain how humans learn (general perspective), while the variation among individuals (differential perspective) has been the focus of psychometric intelligence research. Although both lines of research have been proceeding independently, they increasingly converge, as both investigate the concepts of working memory and knowledge construction. This review begins with presenting state-of-the-art research on human information processing and its potential in academic learning. Then, a brief overview of the history of psychometric intelligence research is combined with presenting recent work on the role of intelligence in modern societies and on the nature-nurture debate. Finally, promising approaches to integrating the general and differential perspective will be discussed in the conclusion of this review.", "The current study focuses on maternal cognitive capacities as determinants of parenting in a highly disadvantaged global context, where children's experiences at home are often the 1st and only opportunity for learning and intellectual growth. In a large sample of 1,291 biological mothers of preschool-aged children in rural Pakistan, we examined the unique association of maternal working memory skills (independent of related cognitive capacities) with cognitively stimulating parenting behaviors. Path analysis revealed that directly assessed working memory, short-term memory, and verbal intelligence independently predicted greater levels of observed maternal scaffolding behaviors. Mothers from poorer families demonstrated lower levels of working memory, short-term memory, and verbal intelligence. However, mothers' participation in an early childhood parenting intervention that ended 2 years prior to this study contributed to greater levels of working memory skills and verbal intelligence. Further, all 3 domains of maternal cognitive capacity mediated the effect of family economic resources on maternal scaffolding, and verbal intelligence also mediated the effect of early parenting intervention exposure on maternal scaffolding. The study demonstrates the unique relevance of maternal working memory for scaffolding behaviors that required continuously monitoring the child's engagement, providing assistance, and minimizing external distractions. These results highlight the importance of directly targeting maternal cognitive capacities in poor women with little or no formal education, using a 2-generation intervention approach that includes activities known to promote parental executive functioning and literacy. (PsycINFO Database Record", "Rapid construction of phase diagrams is a central tenet of combinatorial materials science with accelerated materials discovery efforts often hampered by challenges in interpreting combinatorial X-ray diffraction data sets, which we address by developing AgileFD, an artificial intelligence algorithm that enables rapid phase mapping from a combinatorial library of X-ray diffraction patterns. AgileFD models alloying-based peak shifting through a novel expansion of convolutional nonnegative matrix factorization, which not only improves the identification of constituent phases but also maps their concentration and lattice parameter as a function of composition. By incorporating Gibbs' phase rule into the algorithm, physically meaningful phase maps are obtained with unsupervised operation, and more refined solutions are attained by injecting expert knowledge of the system. The algorithm is demonstrated through investigation of the V-Mn-Nb oxide system where decomposition of eight oxide phases, including two with substantial alloying, provides the first phase map for this pseudoternary system. This phase map enables interpretation of high-throughput band gap data, leading to the discovery of new solar light absorbers and the alloying-based tuning of the direct-allowed band gap energy of MnV2O6. The open-source family of AgileFD algorithms can be implemented into a broad range of high throughput workflows to accelerate materials discovery.", "Domestic chickens are members of an order, Aves, which has been the focus of a revolution in our understanding of neuroanatomical, cognitive, and social complexity. At least some birds are now known to be on par with many mammals in terms of their level of intelligence, emotional sophistication, and social interaction. Yet, views of chickens have largely remained unrevised by this new evidence. In this paper, I examine the peer-reviewed scientific data on the leading edge of cognition, emotions, personality, and sociality in chickens, exploring such areas as self-awareness, cognitive bias, social learning and self-control, and comparing their abilities in these areas with other birds and other vertebrates, particularly mammals. My overall conclusion is that chickens are just as cognitively, emotionally and socially complex as most other birds and mammals in many areas, and that there is a need for further noninvasive comparative behavioral research with chickens as well as a re-framing of current views about their intelligence.", "Obesity is a significant public health issue, and is associated with poor diet. Evidence suggests that eating behavior is related to individual differences in executive functioning. Poor executive functioning is associated with poorer diet (few fruits and vegetables and high saturated fat) in normal weight samples; however, the relationship between these specific dietary behaviors and executive functioning have not been investigated in adults with obesity. The current study examined the association between executive functioning and intake of saturated fat, fruits, and vegetables in an overweight/obese sample using behavioral measures of executive function and dietary recall. One-hundred-ninety overweight and obese adults completed neuropsychological assessments measuring intelligence, planning ability, and inhibitory control followed by three dietary recall assessments within a month prior to beginning a behavioral weight loss treatment program. Inhibitory control and two of the three indices of planning each independently significantly predicted fruit and vegetable consumption such that those with better inhibition and planning ability consumed more fruits and vegetables. No relationship was found between executive functioning and saturated fat intake. Results increase understanding of how executive functioning influences eating behavior in overweight and obese adults, and suggest the importance of including executive functioning training components in dietary interventions for those with obesity. Further research is needed to determine causality as diet and executive functioning may bidirectionally influence each other.", "Any investigation can have a digital dimension, often involving information from multiple data sources, organizations and jurisdictions. Existing approaches to representing and exchanging cyber-investigation information are inadequate, particularly when combining data sources from numerous organizations or dealing with large amounts of data from various tools. To perform digital investigations effectively, there is a pressing need to harmonize how information relevant to cyber-investigations is represented and exchanged. This paper addresses this need for information exchange and tool interoperability with an open community-developed specification language called Cyber-investigation Analysis Standard Expression (CASE). To further promote a common structure, CASE aligns with and extends the Unified Cyber Ontology (UCO) construct, which provides a format for representing information in all cyber domains. This ontology abstracts objects and concepts that are not CASE-specific, so that they can be used across other cyber disciplines that may extend UCO. This work is a rational evolution of the Digital Forensic Analysis eXpression (DFAX) for representing digital forensic information and provenance. CASE is more flexible than DFAX and can be utilized in any context, including criminal, corporate and intelligence. CASE also builds on the Hansken data model developed and implemented by the Netherlands Forensic Institute (NFI). CASE enables the fusion of information from different organizations, data sources, and forensic tools to foster more comprehensive and cohesive analysis. This paper includes illustrative examples of how CASE can be implemented and used to capture information in a structured form to advance sharing, interoperability and analysis in cyber-investigations. In addition to capturing technical details and relationships between objects, CASE provides structure for representing and sharing details about how cyber-information was handled, transferred, processed, analyzed, and interpreted. CASE also supports data marking for sharing information at different levels of trust and classification, as well as protection of sensitive and private information. Furthermore, CASE supports the sharing of knowledge related to cyber-investigations, including distinctive patterns of activity/behavior that are common across cases. This paper features a proof-of-concept implementation using the open source forensic framework named plaso to export data to CASE. Community members are encouraged to participate in the development and implementation of CASE and UCO.", "This paper explores the phenomena of the emergence of the use of artificial intelligence in teaching and learning in higher education. It investigates educational implications of emerging technologies on the way students learn and how institutions teach and evolve. Recent technological advancements and the increasing speed of adopting new technologies in higher education are explored in order to predict the future nature of higher education in a world where artificial intelligence is part of the fabric of our universities. We pinpoint some challenges for institutions of higher education and student learning in the adoption of these technologies for teaching, learning, student support, and administration and explore further directions for research.", "The goal of the paper is to describe the extent to which medical students and professionals are vulnerable to extreme stress. A select review of existing literature on this area has been undertaken, using the English-language online databases EBSCO, Medline and PubMed. The search has identified 36 citations relating to 6324 medical students and 28,285 medical staff (physicians, residents, nurses). The review indicates that merely beginning medical studies is a risk factor for stress, and that medical professionals, who are vulnerable to extreme work stress, say that they do not receive enough support from their co-workers. They are also often notably impulsive, introverted, neurotic and perfectionist, with low emotional intelligence and agreeableness, as well as low and external locus of control. Additionally, from longitudinal studies we have been able to identify psychological factors underpinning admission to a medical university that may be useful for predicting future stress in medical career. The results of this study may be taken into account when organizing psychological intervention programs targeted at educating future medical professionals. It seems that early identification of people at risk could reduce the impact of stress related to medical career and enhance the somatic and mental health of medical professionals.", "The purpose of the present study was to investigate the cognitive and socio-emotional development, as well as the mani- festation of learning disabilities of eight- to ten-year-old children born after intracytoplasmatic sperm injection (ICSI).\nDevelopmental outcomes of 40 children born after ICSI were compared with those of 40 children born after spontaneous conception (SC). Outcome measures included the Raven's Progressive Matrices Test, Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), and Athina Test of Learning Difficulties.\nRegarding cognitive development, ICSI children tend to obtain a similar intelligence score with SC children on Raven's Test. No significant differences were noted on CBCL's syndrome and abilities' profiles, and on Athina Test.\nICSI and SC children show a comparable cognitive and socio-emotional development and have the same chances of manifesting learning disabilities. None of the demographic factors taken into consideration (age, sex of the child, and educational level of the parents) nor the mode of conception seem to affect their well-being."], "authior":
