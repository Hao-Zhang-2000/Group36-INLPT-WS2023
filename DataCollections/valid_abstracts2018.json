{"abstracts": ["The visual impedance hypothesis states that at the time of reasoning, the reading context provokes visual images, which may add irrelevant details to an inference and thus could hamper reasoning. This study aims to create a new visual version of a reasoning task, similar to the traditional propositional task of relational syllogisms, but based on visuospatial components. Using such a task, it would be possible to investigate the deductive ability of relational inferences in tests without the need for reading. Two reasoning tasks were used and measures of working memory, visuospatial memory, intelligence, and reading comprehension were taken. The participants were 61 university students without reading difficulties. Results show that both versions of the reasoning task work similarly in finding the main reasoning effects expected. Findings support the visual impedance effect, that is, fewer correct responses in problems with imaginable contents than with neutral ones. They indicate that this new visual task could be used to explore reasoning skills without reading being involved, and this would be useful for testing reasoning in people both with and without reading difficulties.", "Optical tissue phantoms enable to mimic the optical properties of biological tissues for biomedical device calibration, new equipment validation, and clinical training for the detection, and treatment of diseases. Unfortunately, current methods for their development present some problems, such as a lack of repeatability in their optical properties. Where the use of three-dimensional (3D) printing or 3D bioprinting could address these issues. This paper aims to evaluate the use of this technology in the development of optical tissue phantoms. A competitive technology intelligence methodology was applied by analyzing Scopus, Web of Science, and patents from January 1, 2000, to July 31, 2018. The main trends regarding methods, materials, and uses, as well as predominant countries, institutions, and journals, were determined. The results revealed that, while 3D printing is already employed (in total, 108 scientific papers and 18 patent families were identified), 3D bioprinting is not yet applied for optical tissue phantoms. Nevertheless, it is expected to have significant growth. This research gives biomedical scientists a new window of opportunity for exploring the use of 3D bioprinting in a new area that may support testing of new equipment and development of techniques for the diagnosis and treatment of diseases.", "The purpose of this study is to profile three groups of children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), and both ADHD and ODD, through analyzing their cognitive abilities, personality traits, and family characteristics.\nThe study included 60 patients, with 20 patients in each group. Patients were selected according to the DSM IV criteria. They completed the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised (WISC-R) and the Bender Visual Motor Gestalt Test, and their mothers filled out the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and Marital Conflict Questionnaire.\nThere were no significant differences in picture completion, block design, and coding, which are the WISC-R subtests, between the three groups. In addition, there was no significant difference in verbal, performance, and WISC-R scores. Finally, there was no significant difference when the subdivisions of the CBCL externalizing and internalizing behaviors were analyzed individually. The Frequency of Marital Conflict Score and Conflict Expansion Score were analyzed, and there were no significant differences found between the three groups. The highest average of the Bender Visual Motor Gestalt Test was in the ODD group, whereas the lowest average was in the ADHD group.\nWhen comparing ADHD and ODD in terms of cognitive abilities, the observed differences may be because ODD has no genetic or organic component, and ADHD has an organic basis. In ODD, cognitive abilities are intact, which should underline the environmental and family factors.", "Emotional intelligence (EI) has often been linked to improvements in professional performance. Indeed, generic competencies related to EI have been included in university curricula. However, learning EI involves significant time and effort on the part of students, and this may hinder the acquisition of specific content for each degree. In this study, an intervention to develop EI in higher education students is described and evaluated.\nThe intervention consisted of eight group sessions performed in a regular course aiming to increase EI. The sessions included strategies and training on perceiving and understanding one's own emotions and others' emotions, identifying and understanding the impact one's own feelings in adopting decisions, expressing one's own emotions and the stress experienced, and managing both one's own emotions and emotions of others. Participants were 192 students studying for a Master of Primary Education degree. A quasi-experimental nonequivalent control group pretest-posttest design was adopted. The effectiveness of the intervention was evaluated using multi-level analyses.\nThe results showed a significant improvement in the EI of students in the experimental group compared with the control group.\nThis research demonstrates that it is possible to develop EI in higher education students, without hindering the acquisition of specific content competencies and, therefore, without interfering with their academic performance and without overburdening students with work outside the classroom.\nThe experiment has been registered in the Initial Deposit of the Spanish Center for Sociological Research (CIS). 7/6/2015. http://www.cis.es/cis/opencms/ES/index.html .", "We examined the association of parent training (PT)-related factors with therapeutic success in the Treatment of Severe Childhood Aggression (TOSCA) study. Our aims were (1) to evaluate demographic and clinical characteristics as predictors of parent attendance and engagement in PT and (2) to examine the associations of parent attendance and engagement in PT with study-targeted child behavior outcomes (i.e., attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder [ADHD] and disruptive behavior symptoms). TOSCA was a randomized clinical trial evaluating the effect of placebo versus risperidone when added to PT and psychostimulant for childhood ADHD with severe aggression.\nData for 167 parents and children 6-12 years old with ADHD, oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) or conduct disorder, and severe physical aggression were examined. Analyses used generalized linear models.\nMost parents (72%) attended seven or more of nine sessions. The average parental engagement, that is, the percentage of PT elements fully achieved across participants and sessions, was 85%. The average therapist rating of goal completion was 92%. Parents of non-white and/or Hispanic children (p\u2009=\u20090.01) and children with lower intelligence quotient (p\u2009=\u20090.02) had lower PT attendance; parents with lower family incomes (p\u2009=\u20090.01) were less engaged. Attendance and engagement predicted better scores on the primary child behavior outcomes of disruptive behavior (Nisonger Child Behavior Rating Form Disruptive Behavior Total) and ADHD and ODD symptoms, adjusting for baseline severity.\nWhen the clinical picture is sufficiently severe to warrant prescribing an atypical antipsychotic, PT is feasible for families of children with ADHD and co-occurring severe aggression. The promotion of attendance and engagement in PT is important to enhance clinical outcomes among this challenging population. Methods for overcoming barriers to participation in PT deserve vigorous investigation, particularly for those with low family income, non-white race, Hispanic ethnicity, or when children have lower cognitive level.", "The fraction of the population that reaches the age of 100 years is growing. At this age, dementia incidence is high and cognitive functioning is highly variable across individuals. Normative data for neuropsychological tests are lacking in centenarians, which hampers the ability to evaluate their cognitive functioning for both research and clinical practice. Here, we generated norms for neuropsychological tests in a sample of cognitively healthy centenarians while taking sensory impairments into account.\nCross-sectional cohort study.\nCentenarians who participate in the prospective 100-plus Study.\nA total of 235 centenarians (71.5% female), who self-reported to be cognitively healthy, which was confirmed by an informant and a trained researcher.\nWe generated normative data for 15 cognitive tests, measuring global cognition (Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE]), premorbid intelligence, attention, language, memory, executive function, and visuospatial function by multiple linear regressions and/or by reporting percentiles.\nNormative data for global cognition resulted in a mean MMSE score of 25.6 \u00b1 3.1 (range = 17-30; interquartile range = 24-28). Vision problems and fatigue often complicated the ability to complete tests, and these problems explained 41% and 22% of the missing test scores, respectively. In contrast, hearing problems (4%) and task incomprehension (6%) rarely complicated test performance. While educational level was associated with performance on the majority of the tests, sex and age were only weakly associated with test performance.\nWe generated normative data for 15 common neuropsychological tests in a large sample of cognitively healthy centenarians, while taking age-related sensory impairments into consideration. These normative data allow the detection of deficits across a wide range of cognitive domains. Our results suggest that, next to education level, vision ability and the level of fatigue should be taken into account when evaluating cognitive functioning in centenarians.

The present study aimed to investigate the mathematical abilities and the working memory of students with borderline intellectual functioning (BIF). The sample group included 10 year-old students with BIF (n = 85) and with average non-verbal IQ (n = 45). The children were assessed in non-verbal intelligence, numerical ability and working memory. Our results showed an impairment of mathematical skills, especially in the operation tasks, and working memory in children with BIF, compared to typically developing peers. Generally, their skills seemed to be consistent with intelligence scores (WOND and AWMA scores \u2265 70). In some cases, children with BIF could have mathematical difficulties (WOND < 70). In general, they showed visuospatial short-term memory and central executive subsystem more damaged than non-verbal intelligence while the verbal short-term memory was similar to the IQ.", "Although the association of the N2 component with behavioral inhibition (BIS) has regularly been investigated, its association with other personality characteristics remains widely unknown. We investigated the association of the N2 with the sensitivity of the behavioral activation system (BAS). The aim was not to show that the N2 is linked to trait BAS instead of trait BIS, but that a motivating setting may alter its association with those traits. Furthermore, we aimed at replicating results indicating that the association between reasoning ability and the N2 depends on the matching of the content of the reasoning tasks and the go-nogo task. The electroencephalogram (64 electrodes, P9/P10 offline reference, Biosemi) was recorded in a sample of 117 healthy participants (60 females; age: M\u202f=\u202f24.79, SD\u202f=\u202f3.98), who performed a numerical learning task. At the beginning of each trial, participants heard motivating or neutral words. Participants completed Carver and White's BIS/BAS scales (1994) and the Intelligence-Structure-Test 2000R (Liepmann et al., 2007). The N2 was identified by a temporospatial principal component analysis. Structural equation models revealed that higher trait BAS scores were associated with larger N2s especially when hearing motivating words. Solely higher numerical reasoning scores were associated with larger N2s in the neutral condition. Moreover, the interaction of trait BAS with verbal reasoning ability predicted an increased negativity of the N2 with time-on-task in the motivating condition, suggesting that motivating words yielded an increase of conflict monitoring with time-on-task for participants with higher verbal reasoning ability and higher trait BAS.", "Bullying and poor theory of mind (ToM) are both considered to negatively impact academic performance. However, it is unclear if they have separate effects.\nThe aim of the current study was to examine the potentially separate associations of bullying and ToM with academic performance.\nA general population sample of 1,170 children aged 11-12\u00a0years.\nInformation on bullying, type of involvement (none, victim (only), bully (only), victim-bully (both)), ToM, and estimated intelligence was obtained at face-to-face assessments. Information on academic performance was obtained from Danish school registers.\nToM was positively associated with academic performance, and involvement in bullying was negatively associated with academic performance. Academic performance differed between types of involvement in bullying. Pairwise post hoc analyses showed that in the full sample, the only significant difference was between those not involved and those involved as victim (only). This was also the case for girls. Adjusting for potential shared variance with gender, estimated intelligence and ToM being victim (only) and victim-bully (both) were negatively associated with academic performance compared to no involvement. Thus, being a victim (or victim-bully) contributes negatively to academic performance beyond the effects of ToM and intelligence, and regardless of gender. Similarly, ToM remained positively associated with academic performance after adjusting for shared variance.\nToM and involvement in bullying were both separately associated with later academic performance. These results remained even after adjusting for shared variance, and for shared variance with gender and estimated IQ.", "Time series obtained from time-dependent experiments contain rich information of kinetics and dynamics of the system under investigation. This work describes an unsupervised learning framework, along with the derivation of the necessary analytical expressions, for the analysis of Gaussian-distributed time series that exhibit discrete states. After the time series has been partitioned into segments in a model-free manner using the previously developed change-point (CP) method, this protocol starts with an agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithm to classify the detected segments into possible states. The initial state clustering is further refined using an expectation-maximization (EM) procedure, and the number of states is determined by a Bayesian information criterion (BIC). Also introduced here is an achievement scalarization function, usually seen in artificial intelligence literature, for quantitatively assessing the performance of state determination. The statistical learning framework, which is comprised of three stages---detection of signal change, clustering, and number-of-state determination---was thoroughly characterized using simulated trajectories with random intensity segments that have no underlying kinetics, and its performance critically evaluated. The application to experimental data is also demonstrated. The results suggested that this general framework, the implementation of which is based on firm theoretical foundations and does not require the imposition of any kinetics model, is powerful in determining the number of states, the parameters contained in each state, as well as the associated statistical significance.", "The ability to inhibit a prepared emotional or motor action is difficult but critical to everyday functioning. It is well-established that response inhibition relies on the dopaminergic system in the basal ganglia. However, response inhibition is often measured imprecisely due to a process which slows our responses and increases subsequent inhibition success known as proactive inhibition. As the role of the dopamine system in proactive inhibition is unclear, we investigated the contribution of dopaminergic genes to proactive inhibition. We operationalised proactive inhibition as slower responses after failures to inhibit a response in a Go/No-Go paradigm and investigated its relationship to rs686/A at DRD1 (associated with increased gene expression) and rs1800497/T at DRD2 (associated with reduced D2 receptor availability). Even though our sample (N\u00a0=\u00a0264) was relatively young (18-40\u00a0years), we found that proactive inhibition improves the ability to withhold erroneous responses in older participants (p\u00a0=\u00a00.002) and those with lower fluid intelligence scores (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), indicating that proactive inhibition is likely a naturally occurring compensatory mechanism. Critically, we found that a polygenic risk score consisting of the number of rs686 A and rs1800497 T alleles predicts higher engagement of proactive inhibition (p\u00a0=\u00a00.040), even after controlling for age (p\u00a0=\u00a00.011). Furthermore, age seemed to magnify these genetic effects (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). This suggests that the extent to which proactive inhibition is engaged depends on increased dopamine D1 and decreased D2 neurotransmission. These results provide important considerations for future work investigating disorders of the dopaminergic system.", "Findings of cognitive impairment in major depressive disorder (MDD), including remitted MDD, raise the question whether impaired cognition is part of preexisting vulnerability rather than a consequence of MDD or its treatment. To our knowledge, no meta-analyses have been published on cognitive impairment in first-degree relatives of individuals with MDD.\nTo compare cognitive performance between individuals with and without family history of MDD.\nMedline/PubMed, PsycINFO, and Embase using combinations of search terms for depression, first-degree relatives, and cognition from January 1, 1980, to July 15, 2018.\nOriginal articles that reported data on cognition in first-degree relatives of individuals with MDD compared with controls with no family history of major mental illness.\nMeans and SDs were extracted, and standardized mean differences (SMD) between relatives and controls were calculated for each measure of cognitive performance. The relative-control differences in overall cognition and in specific cognitive domains were synthesized in random-effects meta-analyses with robust variance estimation that allows including multiple correlated measures of cognition within each study. Heterogeneity was quantified with \u03c42. Publication bias was assessed with funnel plots and Egger intercept.\nPerformance on cognitive tests.\nAcross 284 measures of cognition in 54 nonoverlapping samples including 3246 relatives of people with MDD (mean age 15.38 years, 57.68% females) and 5222 controls (mean age 14.70 years, 55.93% females), relatives of people with MDD performed worse than controls across all measures of cognition (SMD\u2009=\u2009-0.19; 95% CI, -0.27 to -0.11; P\u2009<\u2009.001). Domain-specific meta-analyses showed similar size of relative-control difference in most domains of cognition, including Full-Scale IQ (SMD\u2009=\u2009-0.19), verbal intelligence (SMD\u2009=\u2009-0.29), perceptual intelligence (SMD\u2009=\u2009-0.23), memory (SMD\u2009=\u2009-0.20), academic performance (SMD\u2009=\u2009-0.40), and language (SMD\u2009=\u2009-0.29). Study characteristics were not significantly associated with observed between-group differences. There was no evidence of publication bias.\nA general impairment in cognition is a feature of familial disposition for MDD. Cognition may contribute to early identification of risk for depression and may be examined as potential target for early intervention.", "With the emergence of unmanned plane, autonomous vehicles, face recognition, and language processing, the artificial intelligence (AI) has remarkably revolutionized our lifestyle. Recent studies indicate that AI has astounding potential to perform much better than human beings in some tasks, especially in the image recognition field. As the amount of image data in imaging center of ophthalmology is increasing dramatically, analyzing and processing these data is in urgent need. AI has been tried to apply to decipher medical data and has made extraordinary progress in intelligent diagnosis. In this paper, we presented the basic workflow for building an AI model and systematically reviewed applications of AI in the diagnosis of eye diseases. Future work should focus on setting up systematic AI platforms to diagnose general eye diseases based on multimodal data in the real world.", "This study aimed to investigate cognitive functioning, negative symptoms, and the relationships in schizophrenia (SP) pedigrees and to explore the effect of genetic loading on those endophenotypes.\nForty-four patients with SP, 81 first-degree non-psychotic relatives of patients from simplex and multiplex families, 14 matched control probands, and 29 first-degree relatives of the patients from communities were assessed by the vocabulary subtest (VS) of Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, memory span subtests of the Multiple Memory Assessment Scale (MMAS), Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST), Continuous Performance Test (CPT), and Negative Scale of Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale.\nCompared with controls, patients with SP and their relatives had worse performances in WCST and CPT, and more serious negative symptoms. Patients from multiple families performed poorly on most tests while patients from simplex families had impairments only on the parameters of CPT and WSCT as compared to control probands. Patients from multiple families differed significantly from the patients from simplex families in the digit span and word span of MMAS. After controlling for education, in comparison with relatives of control probands, relatives from multiple families showed impairments in VS, multiple domains of CPT, whereas relatives from simplex families had lower scores on the VS and more total cards and random errors in WSCT. The performances of most tests were linked to negative symptoms in patients with SP. For patients with SP, VS, correct numbers and categories in the WCST, and visual and acoustic errors in the CPT predicted 68.8% of the variability in negative symptoms.\nOur findings support that cognitive deficits and negative symptoms may be markers of hereditary susceptibility of SP and aggravate as the degree of genetic load increases. There are certain relationships between cognitive deficits and negative symptoms in patients with SP.", "Care of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) will dramatically change in the upcoming years. The nationwide implementations of the patient-controlled electronic health record (EHR) and the technology-based home monitoring system will most probably be the cornerstones of this revolution. We speculate that, within the course of the next decade, EHRs will lead to a substantial empowerment of patients, and monitoring of motor and non-motor manifestations of PD will shift from the clinic to the home. As far as this can be foreseen, small, partly clothing-embedded and implanted sensor systems allowing passive (i.e., non-obtrusive) data collection will dominate the market. They will interoperate with the personal EHR and other potentially health-related electronic databases such as clinical warehouses and population health analytics platforms. Analysis software will be mainly built on artificial intelligence, and presentation of data will be intuitive. This scenario will eventually help both the patient and the medical professional by providing higher amounts of quality information about daily-relevant effects of disease and treatment, eventually allowing for a better and more personalized care.", "Intellectual disability (ID) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are common among children who are candidates for cochlear implants. However, the implications of these comorbidities for cochlear implant placement have been not fully established. This study sought to identify these implications by comparing developmental delays among children with these conditions.\nParticipants were children who were followed up at least every 6 months for 24 months after cochlear implant surgery. Developmental delays were assessed using the Enjoji Scale of Infant Analytical Development (Enjoji Scale) and compared in three groups with hearing loss: those with ID (ID group, n=4); those with ASD and ID (ASD+ID group, n=4); and those with typical development (control group, n=5). Developmental delay was evaluated longitudinally before and after cochlear implant placement for 18 months.\nAmong the six subscales that make up the Enjoji Scale, language development and intelligence development were significantly delayed in all three groups and were exacerbated over time except for language development in the control group. Emotional development and social behavior were significantly delayed only in the ASD+ID group. Comparison of intergroup differences revealed delays in language development in the ID and ASD+ID groups compared with the control group.\nThe Enjoji Scale successfully demonstrated developmental delays characteristic to the underlying comorbidities of ID with or without ASD in children with cochlear implants. The Enjoji Scale can be a useful diagnostic tool for screening children with cochlear implants for ID with or without ASD.", "To study anxiety disorders in adolescents with Tourette syndrome (TS) and in their mothers.\nTwenty-seven teenagers with TS, aged from 12 to 15 years, and their mothers were included in the main group. The control group consisted of 30 healthy adolescents and their mothers. Methods and scales for assessment of anxiety were administered.\nA significantly higher level of trait and state anxiety was identified in the main group compared to the controls. In addition, mothers of children with TS were characterized by a high level of alexithymia and a significantly lower integrative level of emotional intelligence compared to the control group. Thus, the results indicate the presence of severe emotional disturbances in children with TS and in their mothers.\n\u0426\u0435\u043b\u044c \u0438\u0441\u0441\u043b\u0435\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f - \u0438\u0437\u0443\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043f\u0441\u0438\u0445\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u0440\u0430\u0441\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432 \u0443 \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043a\u043e\u0432 \u0441 \u0441\u0438\u043d\u0434\u0440\u043e\u043c\u043e\u043c \u0422\u0443\u0440\u0435\u0442\u0442\u0430 (\u0421\u0422) \u0438 \u0438\u0445 \u043c\u0430\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0439. \u041c\u0430\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0430\u043b \u0438 \u043c\u0435\u0442\u043e\u0434\u044b. \u041e\u0431\u0441\u043b\u0435\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043b\u0438 27 \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043a\u043e\u0432 c \u0421\u0422 \u0432 \u0432\u043e\u0437\u0440\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0435 \u043e\u0442 12 \u0434\u043e 15 \u043b\u0435\u0442 \u0438 \u0438\u0445 \u043c\u0430\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0439, \u0441\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0432\u0448\u0438\u0445 \u043e\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043d\u0443\u044e \u0433\u0440\u0443\u043f\u043f\u0443. \u0412 \u043a\u043e\u043d\u0442\u0440\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0443\u044e \u0433\u0440\u0443\u043f\u043f\u0443 \u0432\u043a\u043b\u044e\u0447\u0438\u043b\u0438 30 \u0437\u0434\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0445 \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043a\u043e\u0432 \u0438 \u0438\u0445 \u043c\u0430\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0438. \u0414\u043b\u044f \u043f\u0441\u0438\u0445\u0438\u0430\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0438 \u043f\u0441\u0438\u0445\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043e\u0431\u0441\u043b\u0435\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0438\u0441\u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043b\u0438 \u043c\u0435\u0442\u043e\u0434\u044b \u0438 \u0448\u043a\u0430\u043b\u044b, \u043d\u0430\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u043e\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0442\u0440\u0435\u0432\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438. \u0420\u0435\u0437\u0443\u043b\u044c\u0442\u0430\u0442\u044b \u0438 \u0437\u0430\u043a\u043b\u044e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435. \u0414\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0440\u043d\u043e \u0431\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0435 \u0432\u044b\u0441\u043e\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0443\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043d\u044c \u0442\u0440\u0435\u0432\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438 (\u043a\u0430\u043a \u0440\u0435\u0430\u043a\u0442\u0438\u0432\u043d\u043e\u0439, \u0442\u0430\u043a \u0438 \u043b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0439) \u0431\u044b\u043b \u0432\u044b\u044f\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d \u0443 \u043f\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0435\u043d\u0442\u043e\u0432 \u0441 \u0421\u0422 \u043f\u043e \u0441\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044e \u0441 \u043a\u043e\u043d\u0442\u0440\u043e\u043b\u0435\u043c. \u041a\u0440\u043e\u043c\u0435 \u0442\u043e\u0433\u043e, \u0443 \u043c\u0430\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0439 \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043a\u043e\u0432 \u0441 \u0421\u0422 \u043d\u0430\u0431\u043b\u044e\u0434\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0441\u044c \u0432\u044b\u0441\u043e\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0443\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043d\u044c \u0430\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0438\u0442\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0438 \u0438 \u0434\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0440\u043d\u043e \u0431\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0435 \u043d\u0438\u0437\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0432\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0443\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043d\u044c \u044d\u043c\u043e\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u043b\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0442\u0430 \u043f\u043e \u0441\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044e \u0441 \u043a \u043e\u043d\u0442\u0440\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0433\u0440\u0443\u043f\u043f\u043e\u0439. \u0422\u0430\u043a\u0438\u043c \u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0437\u043e\u043c, \u0440\u0435\u0437\u0443\u043b\u044c\u0442\u0430\u0442\u044b \u0438\u0441\u0441\u043b\u0435\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0441\u0432\u0438\u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0443\u044e\u0442 \u043e \u043d\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0447\u0438\u0438 \u0432\u044b\u0440\u0430\u0436\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u044d\u043c\u043e\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u043d\u0430\u0440\u0443\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0443 \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043a\u043e\u0432 \u0441 \u0421\u0422 \u0438 \u0438\u0445 \u043c\u0430\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0439.", "Arsenic contamination of groundwater in Bangladesh has been recognized as a major public problem. The arsenic contamination was first identified in the tubewell water in 1993 in a northern district of Bangladesh. Tubewells are the main source of drinking water in rural areas, and except hilly and terrace upland throughout the Bangladesh, the arsenic-contaminated tube-wells are distributed. Fifty million people of Bangladesh were estimated to be at risk of exposure to arsenic through consumption of water from contaminated tubewells. Chronic exposure to arsenic causes arsenicosis and may include multi-organ pathologies. Many of the health effects of chronic toxicity are evident in Bangladesh. Besides dermatological manifestations, noncommunicable diseases including cancer, adverse pregnancy outcomes, and decreased intelligence quotient among the children are reported to be increasing. Cancer due to long-term low-dose arsenic exposure through consumption of contaminated water is now an important concern of Bangladesh as it is being increasingly reported from arsenic-exposed individuals. Stoppage of consumption of the arsenic-contaminated water is the mainstay of arsenicosis prevention and case management. At present, a higher proportion of the people are still consuming arsenic-contaminated water because of the lack of sustainable arsenic-safe water supply. In providing sustainable arsenic-safe water options, any option advocated should be cheap, easy to use, locally maintainable, and owned by the community. In addressing arsenic-related health issues, arsenic-exposed population needs to be brought under the coverage of the regular surveillance program for detection and subsequent management of noncommunicable diseases and cancers.", "Current pharmacological interventions for Alzheimer's dementia delay symptom progression for about a year. Although the outcomes in earlier disease states may include changes in biomarkers, the clinical effectiveness of any intervention can ultimately only be assessed by a patient's self-reported well-being. A better understanding of earlier manifestations of Alzheimer's disease and the drive for relevant outcome measures, allied to technological advances in artificial intelligence, have mediated the electronic Person-Specific Outcome Measure (ePSOM) development program.\nThere are 4 sequential stages in the ePSOM development program-(1) literature review, (2) focus group study, (3) national survey, and (4) development of an app for capturing person-specific outcomes. Here, we report the overall approach to the program incorporating our literature review on patient-reported outcome measures and patient preferences in the Alzheimer's disease population.\nAlzheimer's disease trials do not use any patient-reported outcome measures. Quality of life measures are often used as proxies for this, but they do not capture individual needs. Therefore, trials currently fail to reflect the participant's aspirations for effect but rather default to clinicostatistical measure of cognition and function. There is no implementation of patient preferences despite evidence that understanding preferences may influence adherence to treatment.\nIt is important to consider preferences for an intervention and use PROMs for the measure of effectiveness given that both risk and benefit are judged by the recipient of the treatment. The ePSOM development program will deliver the methodology for incorporating meaningful outcomes in clinical trials to expand upon current biological and clinical measurements of effectiveness.", "Science and technology (S&T) on three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting is growing at an increasingly accelerated pace; one major challenge represents how to develop new solutions for frequent oral diseases such as periodontal problems and loss of alveolar bone. 3D bioprinting is expected to revolutionize the health industry in the upcoming years. In dentistry, this technology can become a significant contributor. This study applies a Competitive Technology Intelligence methodology to uncover the main S&T drivers in this domain. Looking at a 6-year period from 2012 to 2018 an analysis of scientific and technology production was made. Three principal S& T drivers were identified: Scaffolds development, analysis of natural and synthetic materials, and the study of scaffold characteristics. Innovative hybrid and multiphasic scaffolds are being developed to regenerate periodontal tissue and alveolar bone by combining them with stem cells from the pulp or periodontal ligament. To improve scaffolds performance, biodegradable synthetic polymers are often used in combination with bioceramics. The characteristics of scaffolds such as fiber orientation, porosity, and geometry, were also investigated. This research contributes to people interested in bringing innovative solutions to the health industry, particularly by applying state-of-the-art technologies such as 3D bioprinting, in this case for dental tissues and dental bone diseases.", "Today, meta-analyses demonstrate that cognitive training is safe and effective to enhance vulnerable cognitive functions in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), so that cognitive interventions can be regarded as a promising approach to treat or even prevent cognitive dysfunction in PD. However, many research gaps exist. Thus, this article aims to identify relevant research topics with regard to cognitive interventions in PD patients for the next 20 years. The most important to do's include the development of (non-digital and digital, maybe also artificial intelligence based) standardized cognitive interventions for PD patients in different cognitive stages and the conduct of large randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in these groups, also considering different patient profiles (e.g., motor subtypes) and the living setting (inpatient versus outpatient). The impact of cognitive and combined interventions in individuals with prodromal PD is of high relevance. Studies should elucidate underlying mechanisms of cognitive and neural plasticity induced by cognitive interventions and propose prediction models on which patients profit from which intervention. Health-economic analyses are also urgently needed. More generally, increasing the awareness of the concept of cognitive reserve and possibilities for the prevention of cognitive dysfunction is an important goal.", "Flexible, large-area, and low-cost thermal sensing networks with high spatial and temporal resolution are of profound importance in addressing the increasing needs for industrial processing, medical diagnosis, and military defense. Here, a thermoelectric (TE) fiber is fabricated by thermally codrawing a macroscopic preform containing a semiconducting glass core and a polymer cladding to deliver thermal sensor functionalities at fiber-optic length scales, flexibility, and uniformity. The resulting TE fiber sensor operates in a wide temperature range with high thermal detection sensitivity and accuracy, while offering ultraflexibility with the bending curvature radius below 2.5 mm. Additionally, a single TE fiber can either sense the spot temperature variation or locate the heat/cold spot on the fiber. As a proof of concept, a two-dimensional 3 \u00d7 3 fiber array is woven into a textile to simultaneously detect the temperature distribution and the position of heat/cold source with the spatial resolution of millimeter. Achieving this may lead to the realization of large-area, flexible, and wearable temperature sensing fabrics for wearable electronics and advanced artificial intelligence applications.", "Objectives: The purpose of this study is to investigate the elimination ratios of requested unnecessary tests and the cost-effectiveness to be achieved by means of 5 different algorithms with clinical validity defined in an artificial intelligence program.Methods: The clinician orders received from the hospital information management system were adapted to eliminate AST, direct bilirubin, chlorine, fPSA and fT3 tests using five different algorithms defined in the ALIN IQ software.Results: In this study, 18387 AST, 9500 direct bilirubin, 61 free PSA, 1127 FT3 and 11172 chlorine tests that were ordered within 45\u00a0days were eliminated using 5 different algorithms defined in the ALIN IQ software in the Laboratory of Harran University Faculty of Medicine. USD 5592.76 was saved in 45\u00a0days. The annual saving is expected to be 363710 tests and USD 45363.49.Conclusion: Five different tests were successfully eliminated with this study. Open-code smart softwares, which can create indefinite algorithms may be utilized as test eliminators in diagnostic clinical laboratories. Millions of dollars may be saved by means of such artificial intelligence softwares that can be adapted to any analyzer across the world.", "Relevance of the present work is determined by the considerable prevalence of both affective and cognitive disor-ders in the victims due to the Chornobyl accident, the pathogenesis of which is insufficiently studied.Objective is to identify the neuropsychiobiological mechanisms of the formation of the remote affective and cog-nitive disorders following exposure to ionizing radiation taking into account the specific gene polymorphisms.Design, object and methods of research. The retrospective and prospective cohort study with the external andinternal control groups. The randomized sample of the male participants in liquidation of the consequences of theaccident (Chornobyl clean-up workers, liquidators) at the Chornobyl nuclear power plant (ChNPP) in 1986-1987(n = 198) recruited from the Clinico-epidemiological registry (CER) of NRCRM aged 39-87 (M \u00b1 SD: 60.0-8.5 years)with the external irradiation dose ranged 0.6-5900.0 mSv (M \u00b1 SD: 456.0 \u00b1 760.0 mSv) was examined. The compar-ison group (n = 110) consisted of the unexposed patients of the Radiation Psychoneurology Department with thecorresponding age and sex (the external control group). The internal control group included the liquidators irradi-ated at doses < 50.0 mSv (n = 42). The standard diagnostic neuropsychiatric scales, psychodiagnostic questionnairesand tests, neuropsychological methods (including the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) with premorbid IQ(pre-IQ) assessment), neuropsychiatric and psychophysiological methods (quantitative EEG (qEEG) and the audito-ry cognitive evoked potentials (Event-Related Potentials, ERP) were applied. The genotypes of the serotonin trans-porter gene SLC6A4 were determined by the 5_HTTLPR and rs25531 polymorphisms. The methods of descriptive and vari-ation statistics, non-parametric criteria, regression-correlation analysis, survival analysis by Kaplan - Meier and riskanalysis were used.Results. Cerebrovascular diseases, organic mental and depressive disorders, mainly of radiation-stress-relatednature, prevail among the liquidators. The overall risk of neuropsychiatric pathology increases (Pv < 0.001) with theirradiation dose. The verbal memory and learning are impaired, as well as the full IQ is reduced at the expense of theverbal one. The frequency of both mild cognitive impairment and dementia is risen. The cognitive impairment atdoses > 0.3 Sv is dose-dependent (r = 0.4-0.7; p = 0.03-0.003). Affective disorders (depression) and neurocogni-tive deficit are more severe at higher doses of irradiation (> 50 mSv). In the left posterior temporal region(Wernicke's area) the qEEG indices changes become dose-dependent at doses greater than 0.25-0.3 Sv. The dis-turbed brain information processes lateralized to the Wernicke's area are observed even at doses > 50 mSv. The car-riers of intermediate and low-level genotypes (L\u0410/S, L\u0410/LG, LG/LG, LG/S, S/S) of the serotonin transporter gene SLC6A4have more depressive disorders, especially severe ones, and tend to have more frequent and severe cognitive andstress-related disorders.The debut of depressive disorders in the carriers of the intermediate and low-activity genotypes occurs much earli-er (Log-Rank Test = 4.43, p = 0.035) in comparison with the carriers of the high-performance genotype L\u0410/ L\u0410.Conclusions. The radiation-induced dysfunction of the cortico-limbic system in the left dominant hemisphere ofthe human brain with a specific involvement of the hippocampus is considered to be the key cerebral basis of post-radiation organic brain damage. The association of genotypes by 5_HTTLPR and rs25531 polymorphisms of the SLC6A4gene with affective and cognitive disorders suggests the presence of neuropsychobiological features of these dis-orders associated with ionizing radiation depending on the certain gene polymorphisms.\nAktual'nist' roboty zumovlena znachnoiu poshyrenistiu u postrazhdalykh vnaslidok Chornobyl's'ko\u00ef katastrofyafektyvnykh i kognityvnykh rozladiv, patogenez iakykh vyvcheno nedostatn'o.Meta doslidzhen' \u2013 vyznachyty ne\u012dropsykhobiologichni mekhanizmy formuvannia afektyvnykh i kognityvnykh rozladivviddalenogo periodu pislia vplyvu ionizuiuchogo vyprominiuvannia z urakhuvanniam spetsyfichnykh gennykhpolimorfizmiv.Dyza\u012dn, ob\u2019iekt i metody doslidzhennia \u2013 retrospektyvno-prospektyvne kogortne doslidzhennia iz zovnishnim tavnutrishnim kontrolem.

Response inhibition is considered as a possible behavioral marker, based on the results with two-gate design, which can aid in early detection of anxiety disorders. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between response inhibition and anxiety using a large-scale population-based adolescent sample with single-gate design.\nWe used data from the Tokyo Teen Cohort study which was a population-based survey in adolescence. Anxiety was assessed by the Child Behavior Checklist answered by primary caregivers. Response inhibition was measured using the Go/No-Go task. We estimated Pearson's correlation coefficient to test the relationship between response inhibition and anxiety.\nA total of 2,434 adolescents aged 11-13 years were included in our analyses. We found a significant but weak correlation between response inhibition and adolescent anxiety (r\u202f=\u202f0.07, confidence interval 0.03-0.11, p\u202f<\u202f0.001). Similar results were shown in most of subgroups according to gender, age, and intelligence.\nThe primary outcome was assessed only via parent-reported questionnaire, leading to potential informant bias.\nResponse inhibition may not be considered as a suitable behavioral marker of adolescent anxiety.", "To apply the practical parsimonious modeling method of the Intermountain Mortality Risk Score in a primary care environment to predict chronic disease (ChrD) onset.\nPrimary care patients free of ChrD (women: n=98,711; men: n=45,543) were evaluated to develop (70% [n=95,882] of patients) and validate (the other 30% [n=48,372]) the sex-specific Intermountain Chronic Disease Risk Score (ICHRON) if seen initially between January 1, 2003, and December 31, 2005. The sex-specific ICHRON was composed of comprehensive metabolic profile and complete blood count components and age. The primary outcome was the first diagnosis of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, stroke, diabetes, renal failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, peripheral vascular disease, or dementia within 3 years of baseline.\nAt 3 years, 9.0% of men (mean age, 44\u00b116 years) and 6.6% of women (mean age, 42\u00b116 years) received a diagnosis of ChrD. In the derivation population, C-statistics were 0.783 (95% CI, 0.774-0.791) for men and 0.774 (95% CI, 0.767-0.781) for women. In the validation population, C-statistics were 0.774 (95% CI, 0.762-0.786) for men and 0.762 (95% CI, 0.752-0.772) for women. Evaluation of 10-year outcomes for ICHRON and analysis of its association with each outcome individually at 3 years revealed similar predictive ability.\nAn augmented intelligence clinical decision tool for primary care, ICHRON, is developed using common laboratory parameters, which provides good discrimination of ChrD risk at 3 and 10 years.", "Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA) is a part of the spectrum of early-onset retinal dystrophy (EORD). It usually presents in the first few years of life, most often before the age of 1 year. The prevalence is about 1:80,000. Also known as congenital retinitis pigmentosa (RP), patients have wandering nystagmus, with reduced vision from birth. The fundus is almost normal to start with. Later, pigmentary disturbances develop. The best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) ranges from no light perception (in nearly one third of cases) to no better than 20/400, often with a hyperopic refraction (\u22655.0D). Patients have absent pupillary reflex and some of them have keratoconus (CRB1 and AIPL1). Oculodigital reflex (eye rubbing or poking) is a common association. Electroretinography (ERG) responses are almost undetectable. Patients may have normal intelligence, but some studies suggest that as many as 20% of children with LCA without associated anomalies develop intellectual disability. Patients with GUCY2D mutations have a stable clinical course; those with RPE65 mutations show a period of limited improvement followed by progressive deterioration; and those with AIPL1, CRB1, CEP290, and NMNAT1 mutations show gradual progression over several decades.", "This article seeks to review and analyze the emergence of digital channels designed for ventricular assist device (VAD) patients, caregivers, and practitioners and to understand how such digital channels support the user experience of VAD implantation. Following a content analysis methodology, the authors investigated 16 digital channels designed for VAD patients, caregivers, and practitioners, with data being analyzed thematically. Competitor Positioning Matrix diagrams were created to visually represent the landscape of digital channels that support VAD stakeholders. These matrices identified opportunities and potential areas for improvement in future VAD digital channel design, with an emphasis on interactivity coupled with intelligence and focus along the various stages of the VAD patient journey. Innovation in digital channels has the potential to reduce burden on all users by enabling communication, self-management, and remote monitoring. Digital channels can be information enhanced for point of care, function as a decision support tools or be used to empower patient-caregiver pairs to be more sufficient with self-management, while enabling communication with their practitioner.", "This study examined the characteristics of adult men with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) on social outcomes with particular focus on social function in the context of military service.\nEighty-nine adult male outpatients diagnosed with ADHD in adulthood were included in this retrospective chart review study. Participants were divided into two groups: \"military service group (MS)\" (those who had completed military duty) and \"nonmilitary service group (NMS)\" (those who were exempted from conscription or engaged in public service). MS included 50 subjects and NMS included 39 subjects. The age at first ADHD diagnosis, intelligence quotient (IQ), occupation, and psychiatric comorbidities were compared between the two groups.\nThe age at first diagnosis, IQ, and number of employed participants were significantly higher in MS than in NMS. NMS had significantly more psychiatric comorbidities than those in MS. In both groups, depression was the most common psychiatric comorbidity. Logistic regression analysis showed that the subjects' IQ, psychiatric comorbidity, and age at first diagnosis were determinants of military duty completion.\nThe results strongly suggested that IQ and psychiatric comorbidities are the most crucial factors affecting military service in male adults with ADHD, independent of ADHD.", "Gathering good-quality information is important for effective learning, but children may often need to expend time or energy (i.e., costs) in order to do so. In this study, we examined how 4- and 5-year-olds (N\u202f=\u202f91) gather information from others when one source of information comes at a cost. Children were given three types of question cards (doctor-related, mechanic-related, and neutral questions) and could assign each question to either a doctor or car mechanic puppet. One puppet (either the doctor or the car mechanic, counterbalanced) could be accessed immediately, but the other puppet required either waiting 30\u202fs or completing a tedious sorting task first. Children's verbal intelligence and executive function skills were also assessed. Results showed that cost influenced how children sought information from each of the expert puppets; children selected the costly expert for domain-relevant questions at chance levels and otherwise strongly preferred to question the non-costly puppet. In addition, executive function skills (but not verbal intelligence) related to how frequently children were willing to direct questions to the costly puppet. Overall, these results indicate that children are influenced by costs when gathering information from others and that their ability to expend a cost to gather good-quality information may relate to their inhibition skills. Implications for encouraging effective learning are discussed.", "To give a high-level summary to current approaches for implementing artificial intelligence (AI), we explain the key commonalities and major differences between Turing's approach and Wiener's approach in this perspective. Especially, the problems, successful achievements, limitations, and future research directions of existing approaches that follow Weiner's ideas are addressed, respectively, aiming to provide readers with a good start point and a roadmap. Some other related topics, for example, the role of human experts in developing AI, are also discussed to seek potential solutions for some existing difficulties.", "Socioeconomic disparities in children's early vocabulary skills can be traced back to disparities in gesture use at age one and are due, in part, to the quantity and quality of communication children are exposed to by parents. Further, parents' mindsets about intelligence contribute to their interactions with their children. We implemented a parent gesture intervention with a growth mindset component with 47 parents of 10-month-olds to determine whether this approach would increase parents' use of the pointing gesture, infants' use of pointing, and child vocabulary growth. The intervention had an effect on parent gesture such that by child age 12-months, parents who received the intervention increased in their pointing more than parents in the control condition. Importantly, the intervention also had a significant effect on child gesture use with parents. There was no main effect of the intervention on child vocabulary. Further, the effect of the intervention on pointing was stronger for parents who endorsed fixed mindsets at baseline, and had an added benefit of increased vocabulary growth from 10-18\u00a0months for children of those parents who endorsed fixed mindsets. Incorporating growth mindset approaches into parenting interventions is encouraged.", "Airports are at the forefront of technological innovation, mainly due to the fact that the number of air travel passengers is exponentially increasing every year. As a result, airports enhance their infrastructure intelligence and evolve as smart facilities to support growth, by offering an enjoyable travel experience. New challenges are coming up, which aviation has to deal with and adapt to, such as the integration of Industrial IoT (Internet of Things) in airport facilities and the increased use of smart devices from travelers and employees. Cybersecurity is becoming a key enabler for safety, which is paramount in the aviation context. Smart airports strive to provide optimal services in a reliable and sustainable manner, by working around the domains of growth, efficiency, safety and security. This article researches: (a) the implementation rate of cybersecurity measures in commercial airports; (b) malicious threats that evolve due to IoT and smart devices installed; (c) risk scenario analysis for IoT malicious attacks with threat mitigation actions. With the aim to enhance operational practices and develop robust cybersecurity governance in smart airports, we present a systematic and comprehensive analysis of malicious attacks in smart airports, to facilitate airport community comprehend risks and proactively act, by implementing cybersecurity best practices and resilience measures.", "Self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) are commonly used by type 1 diabetes (T1D) patients to measure glucose concentrations. The proposed adaptive basal-bolus algorithm (ABBA) supports inputs from either SMBG or CGM devices to provide personalised suggestions for the daily basal rate and prandial insulin doses on the basis of the patients' glucose level on the previous day. The ABBA is based on reinforcement learning, a type of artificial intelligence, and was validated in silico with an FDA-accepted population of 100 adults under different realistic scenarios lasting three simulated months. The scenarios involve three main meals and one bedtime snack per day, along with different variabilities and uncertainties for insulin sensitivity, mealtime, carbohydrate amount, and glucose measurement time. The results indicate that the proposed approach achieves comparable performance with CGM or SMBG as input signals, without influencing the total daily insulin dose. The results are a promising indication that AI algorithmic approaches can provide personalised adaptive insulin optimization and achieve glucose control-independent of the type of glucose monitoring technology.", "The aim was to use a theoretical framework developed by Bronfenbrenner in order to investigate if the association between school connectedness and family climate at age 16 and mental health symptoms at age 43 is mediated by social and professional establishment at age 30.\nData were drawn from The Northern Swedish Cohort, a prospective population-based cohort. The present study included 506 women and 577 men who responded to questionnaires at age 16 (in year 1981), age 30 (in 1995) and age 43 (in 2008). Mediation was tested by fitting structural equation models (SEM) and estimating direct effects between proximal processes (school connectedness and family climate) and symptoms of depression and anxiety respectively, and indirect effects via social and professional establishment (professional activity, educational level, and civil status).\nThe standardised estimate for the direct path from school connectedness to depression was -0.147 (p\u202f=\u202f.000) and the indirect effect mediated by professional activity -0.017 (p\u202f=\u202f.011) and by civil status -0.020 (p\u202f=\u202f.002). The standardised direct effect between school connectedness and anxiety was -0.147 (p\u202f=\u202f.000) and the indirect effect mediated by civil status -0.018 (p\u202f=\u202f.005). Family climate was not significantly associated with the outcomes or mediators.\nSelf-reported data; mental health measures not diagnostic; closed cohort; intelligence, personality and home situation before age 16 not accounted for.\nProfessional and social establishment in early adulthood appear to partially mediate the association between adolescent school connectedness and mental health symptoms in middle-age.", "Deep networks provide a potentially rich interconnection between neuroscientific and artificial approaches to understanding visual intelligence, but the relationship between artificial and neural representations of complex visual form has not been elucidated at the level of single-unit selectivity. Taking the approach of an electrophysiologist to characterizing single CNN units, we found many units exhibit translation-invariant boundary curvature selectivity approaching that of exemplar neurons in the primate mid-level visual area V4. For some V4-like units, particularly in middle layers, the natural images that drove them best were qualitatively consistent with selectivity for object boundaries. Our results identify a novel image-computable model for V4 boundary curvature selectivity and suggest that such a representation may begin to emerge within an artificial network trained for image categorization, even though boundary information was not provided during training. This raises the possibility that single-unit selectivity in CNNs will become a guide for understanding sensory cortex.", "Artificial intelligence, deep convolutional neural networks, and deep learning are all niche terms that are increasingly appearing in scientific presentations as well as in the general media. In this review, we focus on deep learning and how it is applied to microscopy image data of cells and tissue samples. Starting with an analogy to neuroscience, we aim to give the reader an overview of the key concepts of neural networks, and an understanding of how deep learning differs from more classical approaches for extracting information from image data. We aim to increase the understanding of these methods, while highlighting considerations regarding input data requirements, computational resources, challenges, and limitations. We do not provide a full manual for applying these methods to your own data, but rather review previously published articles on deep learning in image cytometry, and guide the readers toward further reading on specific networks and methods, including new methods not yet applied to cytometry data. \u00a9 2018 The Authors.

In particular, the function of the central nervous system might be impaired, causing low intelligence quotient, and mental retardation. Overt and subclinical dysfunctions of the thyroid disease should be treated appropriately in pregnancy, aiming to maintain euthyroidism. Thyroxine (T4) replacement therapy should reduce thyrotropin (TSH) concentration to the recently suggested fixed upper limits of 2.5\u00a0mU/l (first and second trimester) and 3.0\u00a0mU/l (third trimester). Overt hyperthyroidism during pregnancy is relatively uncommon but needs prompt treatment due to the increased risk of preterm delivery, congenital malformations, and fetal death. The use of antithyroid drug (methimazole, propylthiouracil, carbimazole) is the first choice for treating overt hyperthyroidism, although they are not free of side effects. Subclinical hyperthyroidism tends to be asymptomatic and no pharmacological treatment is usually needed. Gestational transient hyperthyroidism is a self-limited non-autoimmune form of hyperthyroidism with negative antibody against TSH receptors, that is related to hCG-induced thyroid hormone secretion. The vast majority of these patients does not require antithyroid therapy, although administration of low doses of \u03b2-blocker may by useful in very symptomatic patients.\nNormal maternal thyroid function is essential in pregnancy to avoid adverse maternal and fetal outcomes.", "Artificial intelligence offers the potential for transformational advancement in cardiovascular care delivery, yet practical applications of this technology have yet to be embedded in clinical workflows and systems. Recent advances in machine learning algorithms and accessibility to big data sources have created the ability for software to solve highly specialized problems outside of health care, such as autonomous driving, speech recognition, and game playing (chess and Go), at superhuman efficiency previously not thought possible. To date, high-order cognitive problems in cardiovascular research such as differential diagnosis, treatment options, and clinical risk stratification have been difficult to address at scale with artificial intelligence. The practical application of artificial intelligence in the underlying operational processes in the delivery of cardiac care may be more amenable where adoption has great potential to fundamentally transform care delivery while maintaining the core quality and service that our patients demand. In this article, we provide an overview on how these artificial intelligence platforms can be implemented to improve the operational delivery of care for patients with cardiovascular disease.", "It is generally assumed that human intelligence relies on efficient processing by neurons in our brain. Although grey matter thickness and activity of temporal and frontal cortical areas correlate with IQ scores, no direct evidence exists that links structural and physiological properties of neurons to human intelligence. Here, we find that high IQ scores and large temporal cortical thickness associate with larger, more complex dendrites of human pyramidal neurons. We show in silico that larger dendritic trees enable pyramidal neurons to track activity of synaptic inputs with higher temporal precision, due to fast action potential kinetics. Indeed, we find that human pyramidal neurons of individuals with higher IQ scores sustain fast action potential kinetics during repeated firing. These findings provide the first evidence that human intelligence is associated with neuronal complexity, action potential kinetics and efficient information transfer from inputs to output within cortical neurons.", "Background: The state of palliative care research is closely linked to the development of palliative care services in a country or region. Objective: To systematically review the current state of palliative care research in the Asia Pacific region and analyze its relationship with the performance of each country in the region on the Economist Intelligence Unit's 2015 Quality of Death Index. Design: Systematic review and bibliographic analysis in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis Protocol 2015 (PRISMA-P). Data Sources: The PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, SCOPUS, CINAHL, and PsychiNFO databases were searched on February 4, 2018. Results: One thousand six hundred sixty-seven articles were reviewed. Eighteen out of 32 countries in the region published research. Around 74.15% (1236) of the articles were produced by high-income countries. Research output (articles per 1\u2009m population) was closely linked to country performance on the Economist Intelligence Unit's 2015 Quality of Death Index (adjusted R2 = 0.85). Palliative care research in the region is overwhelmingly focused on cancer (80.13% of articles reviewed). The most common themes of research were \"palliative care service (24.45%)\" and \"clinical\" (15.38%). Conclusions: Palliative care research in the region is growing but remains largely centered on the high-income countries, with many low- and middle-income countries having little published research output. Much work is required to drive research in these countries to generate the evidence required for the development of palliative care services. The emphasis on cancer in research also indicates that the needs of patients suffering from noncancer-related diseases may be neglected.", "Intracranial epidermoid cysts are rare, comprising 0.2% to 1.8% of all primary intracranial expanding lesions, of which <5% occur within the fourth ventricle. Epidermoid cysts are frequently congenital, and patients often present in the fourth decade of life. These cysts produce symptoms as a result of mass effect on surrounding structures, most commonly the cerebellum and cranial nerves. Symptoms can include hearing impairment, trigeminal neuralgia (severe facial pain), facial tics, headaches, double vision, and facial palsy. However, no research has focused on the neuropsychological effects on a patient after surgical resection of these cysts. This case report presents the cognitive profile of a woman after resection of an epidermoid cyst in the fourth ventricle. The 49-year-old patient underwent neuropsychological assessment after removal of the cyst, completing a comprehensive set of cognitive tests of estimated premorbid intelligence, attention, memory, social cognition, language, visual perception, and executive functioning. Test results indicated executive dysfunction and reduced visuospatial memory in the acute stage after surgical removal of the epidermoid cyst. These findings suggest that cognitive deficits can occur after resection of space-occupying lesions in brain regions not typically associated with cognition. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the neuropsychological consequences of surgical removal of a congenital epidermoid cyst in the fourth ventricle. An understanding of the neuropsychological sequelae of this rare cerebral cyst will allow patients, families, and health professionals to better anticipate and manage postoperative difficulties.", "Gender inequality has exploded as a recent issue within mainstream media across US and UK cultural commentary. High-profile scandals of sexual harassment and gender pay differences have focused attention on the on-going disparity between sexes and political status. This paper presents a novel experiment in the application of so-called \"big data\" to analyse gender inequality. Using Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques in the form of Natural Language Processing, a web crawler is used to audit the whole.uk online domain, and to measure the United Kingdom's (UK's) online economic presence for gender representation in terms of: prominence, job roles, and leadership within and across economic sectors. The procedure scans over 200 million web pages, and harvests 157,032 organisations and over 2.3 million people. The results reveal material bias (60%+) towards the representation of men over the majority of economic sectors, and across representation of power and status within job roles and professional titles. The experiment highlights not only new levels of gender bias but also the use of the Internet as a valuable source of plentiful data for social and economic analysis.", "The extent to which early-life cognitive ability shapes individuals' social functioning throughout life, in the context of later-life factors, is unknown. We investigated performance on the Faux Pas test (FP) in relation to psychosocial characteristics and childhood intelligence scores in 90 healthy older men. FP performance was associated with close social network size but not social contact, social support, or loneliness when accounting for both childhood and later-life intelligence, affect, personality, and sociodemography. We add to a growing literature on associations between theory of mind and intelligence, affect, and personality.

Among the sample of 355 participants, 84% were women and 16% were men. Regarding age, 59% were between 18 and 29, 30% were between 30 and 49, and 11% were 50 or older. Using a cross-sectional design, participants completed the Schutte Self-Report Emotional Intelligence Test to measure levels of trait EI and The Eating Attitudes Test (EAT-26) as a measure of eating disorder risk and the presence of disordered eating attitudes.\nEAT-26 scores were negatively correlated with total EI scores and with the following EI subscales: appraisal of own emotions, regulation of emotions, utilisation of emotions, and optimism. Also, compared to those without an eating disorder history, participants who reported having had an eating disorder had significantly lower total EI scores and lower scores on four EI subscales: appraisal of others emotions, appraisal of own emotions, regulation of emotions, and optimism.\nConsidering these findings, EI (especially appraisal of own emotions, regulation of emotions, and optimism) may need to be addressed by interventions and treatments for eating disorders.\nLevel V, descriptive cross-sectional study.", "It is predicted that in the near future robot simulated patients (SPs) will come into use. Through the impressions of five SPs about robot SPs, we explored their vision of the future of medical education as an indicator of what ordinary citizens think. The opinions of SPs were collected using a semi-structured focus group interview, after which the perspectives provided were explored using a qualitative research method called Steps for Coding and Theorization (SCAT). Although SPs accepted the introduction of robot SPs, they regard them as potential substitutes. The use of robot SPs raised concerns about the level of response to human diversity and the level of emotional intelligence. The problem of how much diversity among patients and doctors is acceptable in the field of education was identified. On the part of citizens, there is not much expectation that artificial intelligence (AI) will lead to sophisticated machines capable of human conversation. However, looking ahead to the AI era, real SPs anticipate that, along with the evolution of AI, the next generation of SPs will have thought deeply about their role within a program employing both humans and robots.", "Motivation is a crucial part of animal and human mental development, fostering competence, autonomy, and open-ended development. Motivational constructs have proved to be an integral part of explaining human and animal behavior. Computer scientists have proposed various computational models of motivation for artificial agents, with the aim of building artificial agents capable of autonomous goal generation. Multi-agent systems and swarm intelligence are natural extensions to the individual agent setting. However, there are only a few works that focus on motivation theories in multi-agent or swarm settings. In this study, we review current computational models of motivation settings, mechanisms, functions and evaluation methods and discuss how we can produce systems with new kinds of functions not possible using individual agents. We describe in detail this open area of research and the major research challenges it holds.", "The use of computers has become increasingly relevant to medical decision-making, and artificial intelligence methods have recently demonstrated significant advances in medicine. We therefore provide an overview of current artificial intelligence methods and their applications, to help the practicing ophthalmologist understand their potential impact on glaucoma care.\nTechniques used in artificial intelligence can successfully analyze and categorize data from visual fields, optic nerve structure [e.g., optical coherence tomography (OCT) and fundus photography], ocular biomechanical properties, and a combination thereof to identify disease severity, determine disease progression, and/or recommend referral for specialized care. Algorithms have become increasingly complex in recent years, utilizing both supervised and unsupervised methods of artificial intelligence. Impressive performance of these algorithms on previously unseen data has been reported, often outperforming standard global indices and expert observers. However, there remains no clearly defined gold standard for determining the presence and severity of glaucoma, which undermines the training of these algorithms. To improve upon existing methodologies, future work must employ more robust definitions of disease, optimize data inputs for artificial intelligence analysis, and improve methods of extracting knowledge from learned results.\nArtificial intelligence has the potential to revolutionize the screening, diagnosis, and classification of glaucoma, both through the automated processing of large data sets, and by earlier detection of new disease patterns. In addition, artificial intelligence holds promise for fundamentally changing research aimed at understanding the development, progression, and treatment of glaucoma, by identifying novel risk factors and by evaluating the importance of existing ones.", "In the United States, suicide increased by 24% in the past 20 years, and suicide risk identification at point-of-care remains a cornerstone of the effort to curb this epidemic (1). As risk identification is difficult because of symptom under-reporting, timing, or lack of screening, healthcare systems rely increasingly on risk scoring and now artificial intelligence (AI) to assess risk. AI remains the science of solving problems and accomplishing tasks, through automated or computational means, that normally require human intelligence. This science is decades-old and includes traditional predictive statistics and machine learning. Only in the last few years has it been applied rigorously in suicide risk prediction and prevention. Applying AI in this context raises significant ethical concern, particularly in balancing beneficence and respecting personal autonomy. To navigate the ethical issues raised by suicide risk prediction, we provide recommendations in three areas-communication, consent, and controls-for both providers and researchers (2).", "Pre-emptive medicine is a novel medical concept proposed in Japan that aims to precisely predict the onset and progression of diseases and to provide therapeutic interventions during early stages, before symptoms appear. The concept of pre-emptive medicine considers the time-course of a disease in each individual and seeks medical interventions to prevent disease progression. Suitable and promising targets for pre-emptive medicine are non-communicable diseases, including hypertension. Recent advances in genomic analysis, information technology, and artificial intelligence should make this medical concept feasible in the near future. In this review, we focused on pre-emptive medicine for hypertension, referring to concrete plans for the future direction of this research. The ultimate goal of pre-emptive medicine is to completely prevent the onset and progression of hypertension by precisely predicting the elevation of blood pressure and performing interventions to avoid it. The diagnostic processes of hypertension, from the standpoint of pre-emptive medicine, should include the detection of abnormal blood pressure regulation as the earliest manifestation of the disease, the depiction of the present status of hypertension in an individual (\"nowcasting\"), and a prediction of the future trajectory of the disease (\"forecasting\"). Novel therapeutic strategies for hypertension, from the standpoint of pre-emptive medicine, should aim for the regression of hypertension through early treatments and the remission of hypertension through intermittent intensive therapies. An efficient modification of lifestyle and therapies, according to the progression of hypertension, should be required. If pre-emptive medicine for hypertension becomes established, it would greatly contribute to the extension of a healthy lifespan, which cannot yet be satisfactorily achieved.", "Emotional skills are fundamental for quality service by nursing professionals, providing more personalized attention and a close relationship between the professional and patient.\nTo compare linear relationship models (linear regressions) and models based on comparative qualitative analysis (QCA) in the analysis of the possible influence of socio-demographic variables (age and sex), working conditions (type of contract and seniority) and academic training (type of degree and specific training) on emotional abilities (emotional intelligence and empathy) in nursing.\nIt is a transversal design in a single temporary moment.\nThe sample of this study consisted of 217 direct patient care nursing professionals from 7 public hospitals in Valencia, Spain.\nThe Jefferson Scale for Nursing Empathy was used to measure empathy and the Trait of Meta-Mood Scale 24 to measure emotional intelligence. Two different statistical methodologies were used: traditional regression models and qualitative comparative analysis models of fuzzy sets (fsQCA).\nThe results of the regression model suggest that only sex (negatively in the case of perspective taking) and positively (in compassionate care and thinking like the patient) is a predictive variable in the case of empathy, but not in emotional intelligence. Thus, the results of the fsQCA models provide a greater amount of predictive value for both emotional intelligence and empathy, although when varying the variables that best explained the dimensions, the type of contract and age were the main conditions that were sufficient but not necessary.\nGiven the differences in linear relationship models and fsQCA, far from prioritizing one technique over another, both are complementary and should be used simultaneously in other studies.", "Prospective memory (PM) plays a crucial role in children's academic achievement and interpersonal relationships. However, there is a lack of studies exploring training and transfer effects of process-based PM training in healthy young adolescents. In the current study, 13- to 15-year-old children participated in an 8-day PM training program using the Virtual Week computer game. Transfer of training benefits was measured using other PM tasks (near transfer) and tasks measuring various aspects of executive function (EF) and general intelligence (far transfer). An active control group was used as comparison to assess transfer effects immediately after training and 3 and/or 6 months after training. After training, the trained children performed better on the trained PM task than the control children, and this benefit was still present after 6\u202fmonths. Significant training-induced positive transfer was observed in tasks measuring time-based PM and working memory updating, although the benefits were rather short-lived. No differential, training-induced benefits were found for any of the other transfer tasks. These results suggest some limited potential of PM training to enhance some aspects of PM memory and EF in young adolescents.", "Global processing bias is the automatic tendency to process the global picture before processing the local details. Recent studies suggest that individuals with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) show a lack of global processing bias. In the current study, we examined whether lack of global processing bias affects performance on 2 psychological tests, Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale IV (WAIS-IV) and the Rorschach inkblots test, which require the use of visuospatial processing while measuring different psychological constructs. Adult participants (30 ADHD and 30 typically developing controls) completed the subtests of the WAIS-IV, which rely on visuospatial components, and the Rorschach inkblots test. We found no indication of differences in general fluid intelligence between the groups. On the WAIS-IV test, ADHD participants consistently exhibited superior performance on tasks that relied on local processing and inferior performance on tasks that relied on global processing when compared with healthy controls. On the Rorschach inkblots test, ADHD participants exhibited more responses that referred to local aspects (part/s) of the stimulus and fewer responses that referred to global aspects (whole) of the stimulus. These findings imply that when patients with ADHD are given psychological tests that require visuospatial processing, a potential confound of visuospatial processing style needs to be considered.

A sample size of 171 was calculated by using WHO sample size calculator using non-probability convenient sampling technique. A mixed questionnaire was used as a data collection tool and two groups were defined as video gamers and non-video gamers. Video gamers were those students who were using video games for two hours or more. Cognitive ability of the students were assess by standardized questionnaire named Wonderlic Cognitive Ability Test Questionnaire. Data were entered and analyzed in SPSS version 20.\nThere were 93 (54.4%) gamers whereas 78(45.4%) were non-gamers. Mean age of the participants was 18.86+1.46 years. Gamers with correct answers to knowledge, analogy, processing speed, deductive reasoning, mathematical intelligence were 57(61.3%), 67(72%), 68 (73%), 58 (62.4%) and 73(78.5%) respectively. Significant association was found between gamer status and gender (p=0.023), analogy (p=0.049), processing speed (p<0.001), deductive reasoning (p=0.003) and mathematical intelligence (p<0.001). There was no significant association of gamer status with knowledge (p=0.188).\nGamers exhibit better range of cognitive abilities specifically involving analogy, processing speed, deductive reasoning and mathematical intelligence. In this study, those who play video games on long term basis, showed improvement in cognitive abilities, in comparison to those who do not indulge in gaming activities.", "The purpose of this article is to highlight best practices for writing and reviewing articles on artificial intelligence for medical image analysis.\nArtificial intelligence is in the early phases of application to medical imaging, and patient safety demands a commitment to sound methods and avoidance of rhetorical and overly optimistic claims. Adherence to best practices should elevate the quality of articles submitted to and published by clinical journals.", "We estimate the relative likelihood of success in the searches for primitive versus intelligent life on other planets. Taking into account the larger search volume for detectable artificial electromagnetic signals, we conclude that both searches should be performed concurrently, albeit with significantly more funding dedicated to primitive life. Based on the current federal funding allocated to the search for biosignatures, our analysis suggests that the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) may merit a federal funding level of at least $10 million per year, assuming that the average lifetime of technological species exceeds a millennium.", "Sleep facilitates the extraction of semantic regularities amongst newly encoded memories, which may also lead to increased false memories. We investigated sleep stage proportions and sleep spindles in the recollection of adolescents' false memories, and their potential sex-specific differences.\n196 adolescents (mean age 16.9 y; SD\u202f=\u202f0.1, 61% girls) underwent the Deese, Roediger & McDermott (DRM) false memory procedure and overnight polysomnography, with free recall the following morning. Sleep was scored manually into stages 1, 2, 3 and REM. Stage 2 sleep spindle frequency, density, and peak amplitude were used as measures of spindle activity for slow (10-13\u202fHz) and fast (13-16\u202fHz) ranges.\nIn girls, a lower number of critical lures was associated with higher spindle frequency (p\u202f\u2264\u202f0.01), density (p\u202f\u2264\u202f0.01), and amplitude (p\u202f=\u202f0.03). Additionally, girls' longer sleep duration was associated with more intrusion words (p\u202f=\u202f0.03), but not with critical lures. These associations survived adjustment for age, pubertal status, and intelligence. No significant results emerged in boys.\nIn adolescent girls, higher spindle activity was associated with fewer critical lures being falsely recalled in the DRM paradigm. Unlike studies using adult participants, we did not observe any association between slow-wave sleep and false memory recollection.", "The neurocognitive course of patients who have undergone cerebral revascularization has been the subject of many studies, and the reported effects of carotid artery stenting (CAS) on cognitive function have varied from study to study. The authors hypothesized that cognitive amelioration after CAS is associated with alteration of the default mode network (DMN) connectivity, and they investigated the correlation between functional connectivity (FC) of the DMN and post-CAS changes in cognitive function in order to find a clinical marker that can be used to predict the effect of cerebral revascularization on patients' cognitive function in this preliminary exploratory study.\nThe authors examined post-CAS changes in cognitive function in relation to FC in patients treated for unilateral carotid artery stenosis. Resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) was performed with a 3-T scanner before and 6 months after CAS in 8 patients. Neuropsychological tests (Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale III and Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised) were administered to each patient before and 6 months after CAS. The DMN was mapped for each patient through independent component analysis of the rs-fMR images, and the correlation between FC of the DMN and post-CAS change in cognitive function was analyzed on a voxel level. Multivariable regression analysis was performed to identify preoperative factors associated with a post-CAS change in cognitive function.\nPost-CAS cognitive function varied between patients and between categories of neuropsychological tests. Although there was no significant overall improvement in Working Memory scores after CAS, post-CAS Working Memory scores changed in negative correlation with changes in FC between the DMN and the precentral/superior frontal gyrus and between the DMN and the middle frontal gyrus. In addition, the preoperative FC between those areas correlated positively with the post-CAS improvement in working memory.\nFC between the DMN and working memory-related areas is closely associated with improvement in working memory after CAS. Preoperative analysis of FC of the DMN may be useful for predicting postoperative improvement in the working memory of patients being treated for unilateral stenosis of the extracranial internal carotid artery.Clinical trial registration no.: UMIN000020045 (www.umin.ac.jp/ctr/index.htm).", "Artificial intelligence and automation are topics dominating global discussions on the future of professional employment, societal change, and economic performance.

In 2013, nearly 5\u00a0million people worldwide died from their injuries, and almost 1\u00a0billion individuals sustained injuries that warranted some type of healthcare, accounting for around 10% of the global burden of disease in general. Behind the statistics, severe trauma takes a major toll on individuals, their families and healthcare systems. Management of the patient with severe trauma requires multiple interventions in a highly time-sensitive context and fragmentation of care, characterised by loss of information and time among disciplines, departments and individuals, both outside the hospital and within it, is frequent. Outcomes may be improved by better streamlining of pre- and intra-hospital care.\nWe describe the basis for development of a multi-stakeholder consortium by the European Critical Care Foundation working closely with a number of European Scientific Societies to address and overcome problems of fragmentation in the care of patients with severe trauma.\nThe consortium will develop and introduce an information management system adapted to severe trauma, which will integrate continuous monitoring of vital parameters and point-of-care diagnostics. The key innovation of the project is to harness the power of information technologies and artificial intelligence to provide computer-enhanced clinical evaluation and decision-support to streamline the multiple points at which information and time are potentially lost.\nThe severe trauma management platform thus created could have multiple benefits beyond its immediate use in managing the care of injured patients.", "Research on neurobiological markers of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has been elusive. However, radionuclide studies of cerebral blood flow (CBF) have shown decreased blood flow (hypoperfusion) in the temporal lobes of individuals with ASD across ages and intelligence. This observation fits with current neuroscientific models that implicate temporal regions in social perception and social cognition. Arterial spin labeled perfusion MRI allows noninvasive quantification of regional CBF as part of a multimodal MRI protocol. This method is almost entirely absent from ASD research to date. Our a priori hypothesis was that children with ASD would present with hypoperfusion in the temporal lobes-most notably the fusiform gyrus (given its prominent role in ASD social perception deficits). We also sought to examine the reproducibility of CBF measures, and their relationship to individual differences in facial recognition and ASD symptoms.\nA total of 58 males (33 with ASD) between the ages of 12 and 17\u2009years participated in the study. All children completed two arterial spin labeling and structural (T1) scans using a 3\u2009T Siemens Verio scanner approximately\u20098\u2009weeks apart, as well as behavioral testing at time 1 that included diagnostic measures and the Benton Facial Recognition Test. CBF was the key dependent variable, as was facial recognition performance, and ASD symptoms. The two scans were used for reliability analyses.\nThe ASD group showed hypoperfusion in the bilateral fusiform gyrus and in right inferior temporal gyrus. Intra-class correlations showed moderate to good reliability across time within both groups, and no diagnostic group\u2009\u00d7\u2009time interactions. CBF in the left fusiform gyrus was significantly positively correlated with facial recognition. No significant correlations were observed with core ASD symptoms.\nArterial spin labeling revealed hypoperfusion in children with ASD in regions critical to social perception and cognition. The left fusiform gyrus plays an important role in facial recognition, and greater CBF in this region was correlated with more normative facial recognition performance in children with ASD. This study takes an important first step in establishing CBF of the temporal lobes as a reliable marker of ASD.", "Artificial intelligence research received more and more attention nowadays. Neural Evolution (NE) is one very important branch of AI, which waves the power of evolutionary algorithms to generate Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). How to use the evolutionary advantages of network topology and weights to solve the application of Artificial Neural Networks is the main problem in the field of NE. In this paper, a novel DNA encoding method based on the triple codon is proposed. Additionally, a NE algorithm Triplet Codon Encoding Neural Network Evolving Algorithm (TCENNE) based on this encoding method is presented to verify the rationality and validity of the coding design. The results show that TCENNE is very effective and more robust than NE algorithms, due to the coding design. Also, it is shown that it can realize the co-evolution of network topology and weights and outperform other neural evolution systems in challenging reinforcement learning tasks.", "Diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, and age-related macular degeneration are leading causes of vision loss and blindness worldwide. They tend to be asymptomatic in the early phase of disease and therefore require active screening programs to identify the patients requiring referral and treatment.

With the increase of suicide cases in the world, more and more professionals have been interested in the link between both variables. Aim: To study all the available evidence on the association between EI and suicidal behavior. Method: We systematically reviewed all available literature (in English or Spanish) on the relationship between both variables through the main databases. Results: Twenty-five articles were included. EI and suicidal behavior correlated inversely in almost all the articles that the Emotional Quotient Inventory (EQ-i), The Emotional Intelligence Test (EIT), The Spanish Wong and Law Emotional Intelligence Scale (WLEIS), and The Schutte Emotional Intelligence Scale (EIS/SSEIT), Barchard's Emotional Intelligence Scale, were used, that is, the higher suicidal behavior level the lower the EI score. The same results were found in two out of four investigations that used the Trait Meta-Mood Scale (TMMS-24) between clarity (emotional understanding) and emotional repair (emotional regulation) and suicidal behavior. Two out of three studies that used the Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test (MSCEIT) found that only the Strategic component of EI (emotional understanding and regulation) was a protective factor. Conclusions: The results appear to indicate that a high level of EI plays an important role in protecting against suicidal behavior, and should thus be integrated into suicide prevention programs.", "Emotional intelligence (EI) is considered as a factor influencing sport performance. The research findings are inconsistent with respect to the size and even the direction of the relationship, however. In order to summarise the available evidence, we conducted a meta-analysis examining the relationship between emotional intelligence (EI) and sports performance in competitive sports. A systematic literature search was conducted in June 2018. We identified 21 studies targeting EI and sports performance in competitive sports. We calculated correlation (r) to estimate the effect of the relationship. A random effects model was used to interpret findings. The meta-analysis of 22 effect sizes on the response of 3.431 participants found a small but significant relationship between EI and sports performance (r = 0.16). Additionally, the conceptualisation of EI (ability concept, trait concept, or mixed-model concept), type of publication, citation counts, and publication date turned out not to be significant moderators. Overall, the result is encouraging regarding the value of EI as a possible predictor in sports performance.", "Health care workers need artificial intelligence. Artificial intelligence is a set of studies and techniques that tend to the realization of machines, which solve complex problems automatically, simulating or emulating human intelligence activities. Human intelligence is innate, creative, emotional, sporting, social in the collective and connected future. Knowledge is the faculty, act, mode, effect of taking possession, intellectually or psychologically, with systematic activity of any certain aspect of reality. The dates are given in the form of text, number, symbol, image, sounds that are used or stored in computers. Having many data or data does not mean having much information. Having a lot of information does not mean having a lot of knowledge. Symbolic reasoning uses symbolic logic, logical connectives, expert systems, production rules, genetic algorithms, validation, explanation, justification, verification of inference, heuristic research. The knowledge of symbolic reasoning is deterministic. Machine learning is the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being programmed to do so. Use algorithms for statistical and probability calculations, the learning phases may not be verifiable. They are mathematically structured human opinions, spoiled by the pre -understandings of those who design them, of those who want to look for something. The association between symbolic reasoning and automatic learning is excellent. The intelligence of health workers work connected and collective, develop knowledge bases to be subjected to symbolic reasoning, expert systems and rules to have deterministic knowledge. The deterministic knowledge subsequently elaborated by artificial intelligence will be returned to human intelligences.", "The functioning of attention is complex, a primordial function in several cognitive processes and of great interest to neuropsychology. The Test of Variables of Attention (T.O.V.A) is a continuous computerized performance test that evaluates some attention components such as response time to a stimulus and errors due to inattention and impulsivity.\n1) To evaluate the applicability of T.O.V.A in Brazilian adults; 2) To analyze the differences in performance between genders, age ranges, and levels of education; 3) To examine the association between T.O.V.A variables and other attention and cognitive screening tests.\nThe T.O.V.A was applied to 63 healthy adults (24 to 78 years of age) who also underwent the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Digit Span and Digit Symbol (Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Adults - WAIS-III) and the Trail Making Test.\nthe T.O.V.A was little influenced by age or education, but was influenced by gender. The correlations between some T.O.V.A variables and the Digit Symbol and Trail Making test were weak (r-values between 0.2 and 0.4), but significant (p<0.05).

Participants included 875 children and adolescents between 8 and 19\u00a0years old from the D-KEFS normative sample (48% male; 52% female). Among these participants, 838 had complete data and were included in the current study. The racial/ethnic composition of the sample was: White (73.7%), African American (12.4%), Hispanic (11.1%), and other racial/ethnic backgrounds (2.7%). The Overall Test Battery Mean (OTBM) and the prevalence of low scores at various clinical cut-offs were calculated for the 13 primary scores from the D-KEFS Trail Making Test, Verbal Fluency Test, and Color-Word Interference Test. The OTBM and base rates were also calculated separately for those scores reflecting executive functioning (n =\u00a07) and processing speed (n =\u00a06). Healthy children and adolescents commonly obtained low scores on the D-KEFS tests considered here. Younger age, lower estimated full-scale intelligence quotient, and more test scores interpreted were associated with a greater frequency of low scores. Clinicians and researchers are encouraged to consider these multivariate base rates when assessing and attempting to identify executive functioning impairment among children and adolescents with the D-KEFS.", "The doctor-patient relationship has been evolving from benevolent paternalism to a more patient-centered relationship in the modern era. Although artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to improve nearly every aspect of health care, many physicians are skeptical about integrating AI into their current medical practice. The purpose of this article is to explore what AI means for the doctor-patient relationship and for breast imaging radiologists.\nThe promise of AI is its potential to release physicians from tasks that are better performed by automation. AI may enhance our diagnostic accuracy to the point that we are able to refocus on the art of the doctor-patient relationship.", "Quantum computing and artificial intelligence, combined together, may revolutionize future technologies. A significant school of thought regarding artificial intelligence is based on generative models. Here, we propose a general quantum algorithm for machine learning based on a quantum generative model. We prove that our proposed model is more capable of representing probability distributions compared with classical generative models and has exponential speedup in learning and inference at least for some instances if a quantum computer cannot be efficiently simulated classically. Our result opens a new direction for quantum machine learning and offers a remarkable example where a quantum algorithm shows exponential improvement over classical algorithms in an important application field.", "One of the trends in the current research in psychology is to explore how personal variables can determine a person's communication style. Our objective was to find out the moderating effect of mood in the relationship between the five big personality traits and an aggressive verbal communication style risk factor from work activities in a sample of nursing professionals. This study is a quantitative descriptive design. The final sample was 596 nurses with an age range of 22 to 56 years. An ad hoc questionnaire was used to collect sociodemographic data, and the 10-item Big Five Inventory, the Communication Styles Inventory, and the Brief Emotional Intelligence Inventory for Senior Citizens were used. This study shows that, for nursing professionals, the agreeableness, conscientiousness, and neuroticism traits have a close relationship with aggressive verbal communication. Even though mood moderates this relationship, it is only significant for those individuals with high scores in neuroticism. Since personality dimensions are considered to be relatively stable over time and consistent from one situation to another, organizations should offer workshops and other types of practical activities to train workers in communication skills and emotional intelligence, in order to promote the health of employees and patients, and avoid risk factors from work activities in nursing.", "Digital health interventions present an important opportunity to improve health care for people with psychosis or bipolar disorder, but despite their potential, integrating and implementing them into clinical settings has been difficult worldwide. This Review aims to identify factors affecting implementation of digital health interventions for people affected by psychosis or bipolar disorder. We searched seven databases and synthesised data from 26 studies using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research. Attitudes and beliefs about interventions were crucial factors for both staff and service users, with negative attitudes and scepticism resulting in a lack of motivation to engage with interventions or complete them. The complexity of the interventions was a barrier for people with psychiatric symptoms, low premorbid intelligence quotient, or minimal information technology skills. The accessibility and adaptability of interventions were key facilitators, but insufficient resources, finances, and staff time were barriers to implementation. Interventions need to be user friendly and adaptable to the needs and capabilities of people with psychosis or bipolar disorder, and the staff who support their implementation. Service users and staff should cofacilitate the process of developing and implementing the interventions.", "The endocytoscopic system (ECS) helps in virtual realization of histology and can aid in confirming histological diagnosis in vivo. We propose replacing biopsy-based histology for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) by using the ECS. We applied deep-learning artificial intelligence (AI) to analyse ECS images of the esophagus to determine whether AI can support endoscopists for the replacement of biopsy-based histology.\nA convolutional neural network-based AI was constructed based on GoogLeNet and trained using 4715 ECS images of the esophagus (1141 malignant and 3574 non-malignant images). To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of the AI, an independent test set of 1520 ECS images, collected from 55 consecutive patients (27 ESCCs and 28 benign esophageal lesions) were examined.\nOn the basis of the receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis, the areas under the curve of the total images, higher magnification pictures, and lower magnification pictures were 0.85, 0.90, and 0.72, respectively. The AI correctly diagnosed 25 of the 27 ESCC cases, with an overall sensitivity of 92.6%. Twenty-five of the 28 non-cancerous lesions were diagnosed as non-malignant, with a specificity of 89.3% and an overall accuracy of 90.9%. Two cases of malignant lesions, misdiagnosed as non-malignant by the AI, were correctly diagnosed as malignant by the endoscopist. Among the 3 cases of non-cancerous lesions diagnosed as malignant by the AI, 2 were of radiation-related esophagitis and one was of gastroesophageal reflux disease.\nAI is expected to support endoscopists in diagnosing ESCC based on ECS images without biopsy-based histological reference.", "Epilepsy is highly prevalent among patients with intellectual disability (ID), and seizure control is often difficult. Identification of the underlying etiology in this patient group is important for daily clinical care. We assessed the diagnostic yield of whole exome sequencing (WES). In addition, we evaluated which clinical characteristics influence the likelihood of identifying a genetic cause and we assessed the potential impact of the genetic diagnosis on (antiepileptic) treatment strategy.\nOne hundred patients with both unexplained epilepsy and (borderline) ID (intelligence quotient \u2264\u00a085) were included. All patients were evaluated by a clinical geneticist, a (pediatric) neurologist, and/or a specialist ID physician. WES analysis was performed in two steps. In step 1, analysis was restricted to the latest versions of ID and/or epilepsy gene panels. In step 2, exome analysis was extended to all genes (so-called full exome analysis). The results were classified according to the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics guidelines.\nIn 58 patients, the diagnostic WES analysis reported one or more variant(s). In 25 of the 100 patients, these were classified as (likely) pathogenic, in 24 patients as variants of uncertain significance, and in the remaining patients the variant was most likely not related to the phenotype. In 10 of 25 patients (40%) with a (likely) pathogenic variant, the genetic diagnosis might have an impact on the treatment strategy in the future.\nThis study illustrates the clinical diagnostic relevance of WES for patients with both epilepsy and ID. It also demonstrates that implementing WES diagnostics might have impact on the (antiepileptic) treatment strategy in this population. Confirmation of variants of uncertain significance in (candidate) genes may further increase the yield.", "Working memory (WM) declines with increasing age. The WM capacity is often measured by means of the computerized version of the n-back task. Although the n-back task is widely used in aging research, little is known about its construct validity and specific cognitive functions involved in this task. Moreover, to date, no studies analyzed the construct validity as a function of age. To this end, we conducted a study in a sample of N = 533 individuals aged between 20 and 80 years. The sample was divided into three age groups: young (20-40), middle-aged (41-60), and old (61-80 years). A number of psychometric tests was selected that measure attention, memory, and executive control to elucidate the impact of these constructs on n-back performance. A series of correlation analyses was conducted to assess the relationship between n-back performance and specific cognitive functions in each age group separately. The results show a progressive increase in reaction times and a decrease in the proportion of detected targets from young to old subjects. Age-related impairments were also found in all psychometric tests except for the vocabulary choice test measuring crystallized intelligence. Most importantly, correlations yielded different age-related patterns of functions contributing to performance in the n-back task: whereas performance was most related to executive functions in young age, a combination of attentional and executive processes was associated with performance in middle-aged subjects. In contrast, in older age, mainly attentional, verbal memory, and updating and to a lesser extent executive processes seem to play a crucial role in the n-back task, suggesting a shift of processing strategies across the lifespan.", "When a satellite performs complex tasks such as discarding a payload or capturing a non-cooperative target, it will encounter sudden changes in the attitude and mass parameters, causing unstable flying and rolling of the satellite. In such circumstances, the change of the movement and mass characteristics are unpredictable. Thus, the traditional attitude control methods are unable to stabilize the satellite since they are dependent on the mass parameters of the controlled object. In this paper, we proposed a reinforcement learning method to re-stabilize the attitude of a satellite under such circumstances. Specifically, we discretize the continuous control torque, and build a neural network model that can output the discretized control torque to control the satellite. A dynamics simulation environment of the satellite is built, and the deep Q Network algorithm is then performed to train the neural network in this simulation environment. The reward of the training is the stabilization of the satellite. Simulation experiments illustrate that, with the iteration of training progresses, the neural network model gradually learned to re-stabilize the attitude of a satellite after unknown disturbance. As a contrast, the traditional PD (Proportion Differential) controller was unable to re-stabilize the satellite due to its dependence on the mass parameters. The proposed method adopts self-learning to control satellite attitudes, shows considerable intelligence and certain universality, and has a strong application potential for future intelligent control of satellites performing complex space tasks.", "Are mathematical learning difficulties caused by impairment of the abilities that underlie mathematical talent? Or are mathematical difficulties and talent qualitatively different? The main goal of this study was to determine whether mathematical learning difficulties are explained by the same executive functions as mathematical talent. We screened a pool of 2,682 first-year high school students and selected 48 for evaluation, dividing them into three groups: those with mathematical learning difficulties (n = 16), those with typical performance (n = 16), and those with mathematical talent (n = 16). Adolescents from the learning difficulties and talented groups had age, reading skills, and verbal and non-verbal intelligence that were similar to those of the typical performance group. Participants were administered a suite of tasks to evaluate verbal and visual short-term memory and executive functions of inhibition, shifting, and updating. Different executive functions showed different contributions at the two ends of the math ability continuum: lower levels of performance in updating visual information were related to mathematical learning difficulties, while greater shifting abilities were related to mathematical talent. Effect sizes for the differences in performance between groups were large (Hedges' g > 0.8). These results suggest that different executive functions are associated with mathematical learning difficulties and mathematical talent. We discuss how these differences in executive functions could be related to the different types of mathematical abilities that distinguish the three groups.", "Samples of PM2.5 were collected from an urban area close to a national highway in Agra, India and sequentially extracted into four different fractions: water soluble (F1), reducible (F2), oxidizable (F3) and residual fraction (F4) for chemical fractionation of arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), cobalt (Co), chromium (Cr), nickel (Ni) and lead (Pb). The metals were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy in each fraction. The average mass concentration of PM2.5 was 93\u2009\u00b1\u200924\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0m-3.The total concentrations of Cr, Pb, Ni, Co, As and Cd in fine particle were 192\u2009\u00b1\u200954, 128\u2009\u00b1\u200925, 108\u2009\u00b1\u200934, 36\u2009\u00b1\u20096, 35\u2009\u00b1\u20095 and 8\u2009\u00b1\u20092\u00a0ng\u00a0m-3, respectively. Results indicated that Cd and Co had the most bioavailability indexes. Risk Assessment Code and contamination factors were calculated to assess the environmental risk. The present study evaluated the potential Pb hazard to young children using the Integrated Exposure Uptake Biokinetic Model. From the model, the probability density of PbB (blood lead level) revealed that at the prevailing atmospheric concentration, 0.302 children are expected to have PbB concentrations exceeding 10\u00a0\u03bcg dL-1 and an estimated IQ (intelligence quotient) loss of 1.8 points. The predicted blood Pb levels belong to Group 3 (PbB\u2009<\u20095\u00a0\u03bcg dL-1). Based on the bioavailable fractions, carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic risks via inhalation exposure were assessed for infants, toddlers, children, males and females. The hazard index for potential toxic metals was 2.50, which was higher than the safe limit (1). However, the combined carcinogenic risk for infants, toddlers, children, males and females was marginally higher than the precautionary criterion (10-6).", "Lithium is a widely used and effective treatment for individuals with psycho-neurological disorders, and it exhibits protective and regenerative properties in multiple brain injury animal models, but the clinical experience in young children is limited due to potential toxicity. As an interim analysis, this paper reports the safety/tolerability profiles of low-dose lithium treatment in children with intellectual disability (ID) and its possible beneficial effects. In a randomized, single-center clinical trial, 124 children with ID were given either oral lithium carbonate 6 mg/kg twice per day or the same dose of calcium carbonate as a placebo (n = 62/group) for 3 months. The safety of low-dose lithium treatment in children, and all the adverse events were monitored. The effects of low-dose lithium on cognition was evaluated by intelligence quotient (IQ), adaptive capacity was assessed by the Infant-Junior Middle School Students Social-Life Abilities Scale (IJMSSSLAS), and overall performance was evaluated according to the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I) scale. After 3 months of lithium treatment, 13/61 children (21.3%) presented with mild side effects, including 4 (6.6%) with gastrointestinal symptoms, 4 (6.6%) with neurological symptoms, 2 (3.3%) with polyuria, and 3 (4.9%) with other symptoms-one with hyperhidrosis, one with alopecia, and one with drooling. Four children in the lithium group had elevated blood thyroid stimulating hormone, which normalized spontaneously after lithium discontinuation. Both IQ and IJMSSSAS scores increased following 3 months of lithium treatment (F = 11.03, p = 0.002 and F = 7.80, p = 0.007, respectively), but such increases were not seen in the placebo group. CGI-I scores in the lithium group were 1.25 points lower (better) than in the placebo group (F = 82.66, p < 0.001) after 3 months of treatment. In summary, lithium treatment for 3 months had only mild and reversible side effects and had positive effects on cognition and overall performance in children with ID.

However, despite recent advances in signal processing and classification algorithms focused on heart sounds, clinical acceptance of this technology has been limited, in part due to lack of objective performance data. We hypothesized that a heart murmur detection algorithm could be quantitatively and objectively evaluated by virtual clinical trial. All cases from the Johns Hopkins Cardiac Auscultatory Recording Database (CARD) with either a pathologic murmur, an innocent murmur or no murmur were selected. The test algorithm, developed independently of CARD, analyzed each recording using an automated batch processing protocol. 3180 heart sound recordings from 603 outpatient visits were selected from CARD. Algorithm estimation of heart rate was similar to gold standard. Sensitivity and specificity for detection of pathologic cases were 93% (CI 90-95%) and 81% (CI 75-85%), respectively, with accuracy 88% (CI 85-91%). Performance varied according to algorithm certainty measure, age of patient, heart rate, murmur intensity, location of recording on the chest and pathologic diagnosis. This is the first reported comprehensive and objective evaluation of an AI-based murmur detection algorithm to our knowledge. The test algorithm performed well in this virtual clinical trial. This strategy can be used to efficiently compare performance of other algorithms against the same dataset and improve understanding of the potential clinical usefulness of AI-assisted auscultation.", "Since the beginning of the 21st century, the amount of data obtained from public health surveillance has increased dramatically due to the advancement of information and communications technology and the data collection systems now in place.\nThis paper aims to highlight the opportunities gained through the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods to enable reliable disease-oriented monitoring and projection in this information age.\nIt is foreseeable that together with reliable data management platforms AI methods will enable analysis of massive infectious disease and surveillance data effectively to support government agencies, healthcare service providers, and medical professionals to response to disease in the future.", "Pharmaceutical companies rely on regulatory intelligence (RI) to analyze information from internal and external sources. To facilitate RI activities, companies are seeking ways to harness technology to optimize their capabilities. Specifically, there is a growing interest for artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance RI activities. However, exploration of the potential utility of AI and related technologies will be key to begin unlocking these tools for the regulatory community.\nTo identify potential development paths for these technologies, we interviewed over 30 global regulatory leaders at 22 pharmaceutical companies and 3 leading companies in RI and AI technologies. Thirteen of the 22 pharmaceutical companies also provided responses to a subsequent informational survey.\nThis study elucidated potential value proposition, barriers, and risks to integrating AI into the RI field. Twenty of the 22 participating companies consider that AI offers significant opportunity for RI activities of data processing (mining, searching, monitoring, alerting). Thirty-two percent of companies envisage use in data synthesis (combining different types of information across formats), 36% in data analysis (trends, patterns, predictive analytics), and 23% in decision making. Additionally, results of this research provided insights about the potential role of precompetitive consortia, which may enhance future actualization.\nOpportunity presents for AI to enhance quality, speed, and efficiency of RI activities. This assessment of the current technology landscape revealed a lack of fully developed AI tools; however, the RI community demand is beginning to be recognized. Therefore, now more than ever, the timing to advance AI within the RI field is right.", "It has been demonstrated that nurturing and affiliative touch is essential for human emotional and physical well-being throughout our entire life. Within the last 30 years a system of low-threshold mechanosensitive C fibers innervating the hairy skin was discovered and described; this system is hypothesized to represent the neurobiological substrate for the affective and rewarding properties of touch. This discovery opens new perspectives for multidisciplinary research of the role of affiliative social touch in health and disease, and calls for establishing novel psychometric tools assessing individual differences in the domain of affective touch. The main objective of the study was to construct and validate a Russian version of the Touch Experiences and Attitudes Questionnaire (TEAQ), a self-report measure recently developed to quantify individual experience and attitude to social and affective touch. A pool of 117 items was translated into Russian and all the items were assessed for appropriateness for Russian culture (232 participants). After exploring the factor structure (468 participants), we composed a 37-item questionnaire (TEAQ-37 Rus) characterized by good reliability and a clear 5-factor structure, covering the aspects of attitude to intimate touch, attitude to friendly touch, attitude to self-care, current intimate touch experiences, and childhood touch experiences. Confirmatory factor analysis (551 participants) has demonstrated good consistency and reliability of the 5-factor structure of the TEAQ-37 Rus. Cross-validation research demonstrated moderate positive correlations between predisposition to social touch and emotional intelligence; positive correlations with extraversion and openness facets of the Big Five personality model were also found. As predicted, participants with higher TEAQ-37 Rus scores rated all observed kinds of touch as more pleasant, with a particular preference for slow touch. We anticipate that this questionnaire will be a valuable tool for researchers of social touch, touch perception abnormalities, and the importance of touch experiences for emotional and mental health.", "To explore the effect of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) combined with atomoxetine (ATX) in the treatment of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).\nSixty-four patients with newly diagnosed ADHD were enrolled from January 2016 to October 2017 from Psychological Centre for Adolescents and Children at 102th Hospital of People's Liberation Army of China. These patients were randomly assigned to three groups according to treatment method: the rTMS group, the ATX group, and the rTMS+ ATX group. Before treatment and 6 weeks after treatment, clinical symptoms and executive functions of ADHD patients were evaluated with the Swanson, Nolan, and Pelham, Version IV (SNAP-IV) Questionnaire, continuous performance test, three subtests (arithmetic, digit span, and coding) of Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, as well as Iowa Gambling Tasks (IGT). The effects of treatment were compared among three groups.\nAfter 6 weeks of treatment, the scores of all factors in the SNAP-IV questionnaire were lower than those before treatment in the three groups; the scores of three subtests of Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, continuous performance test, and IGT were also significantly higher than those before treatment. The rTMS+ ATX group had a better improvement in attention deficits and hyperactivity impulse on the SNAP-IV questionnaire compared with the other groups, and also had a higher efficacy on cold and hot executive functions such as arithmetic, forward numbers, coding, and IGT. In addition, the ATX group performed better than the rTMS group in coding and IGT.\nrTMS, ATX, and the combination therapy are effective in improving core symptoms and executive function in patients with ADHD. The combined treatment has significant therapeutic advantages over the single treatment groups. Compared with rTMS, the drug therapy has a better improvement in coding and IGT.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) is beginning to transform IMRT treatment planning for head and neck patients. However, the complexity and novelty of AI algorithms make them susceptible to misuse by researchers and clinicians. Understanding nuances of new technologies could serve to mitigate potential clinical implementation pitfalls. This article is intended to facilitate integration of AI into the radiotherapy clinic by providing an overview of AI algorithms, including support vector machines (SVMs), random forests (RF), gradient boosting (GB), and several variations of deep learning. This document describes current AI algorithms that have been applied to head and neck IMRT planning and identifies rapidly growing branches of AI in industry that have potential applications to head and neck cancer patients receiving IMRT. AI algorithms have great clinical potential if used correctly but can also cause harm if misused, so it is important to raise the level of AI competence within radiation oncology so that the benefits can be realized in a controlled and safe manner.", "ACT-R is a hybrid cognitive architecture. It is comprised of a set of programmable information processing mechanisms that can be used to predict and explain human behavior including cognition and interaction with the environment. We start by reviewing its history, which shapes its current form, contrasts and relates it to other architectures, and helps readers to anticipate where it is going. Based on this history, we then describe it as a theory of cognition that is realized as a computer program. After this, we briefly discuss tools for working with ACT-R, and also note several major accomplishments that have been gained by working with ACT-R in both basic and applied science, including summarizing some of the insights about human behavior. We conclude by discussing its future, which we believe will include adding emotions and physiology, increasing usability, and the use of nongenerative models. This article is categorized under: Computer Science > Artificial Intelligence Psychology > Reasoning and Decision Making Psychology > Theory and Methods.", "This study examined growth trajectories of teacher-reported adaptive behavior in a diverse sample of adolescents with autism spectrum disorder. The participants were 244 adolescents between the ages of 14 and 21\u2009years who were assessed at up to four time points across two and a half years of high school. Demographic variables (age, sex, race, maternal education), phenotypic characteristics (intelligence quotient, autism severity) and school factors (location of the school, school quality) were collected. Growth mixture modeling was used to identify distinct classes of growth trajectories in communication, daily living skills, and socialization domains of adaptive behavior. Two distinct classes were identified for each domain. The first class had moderately low adaptive behavior scores and demonstrated growth of adaptive behavior over time and the second class had low adaptive behavior scores and did not demonstrate change over time. Adolescents within the moderately low adaptive behavior classes were younger at enrollment in the study, had higher IQs, and lower autism symptom severity. Logistic regressions were performed, and aspects of school quality predicted the likelihood of being in the moderately low classes above and beyond autism symptoms.", "To investigate the structural changes of the brain that correlate with physical frailty and cognitive impairments in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients.\nSixty-one PD patients and 59 age- and sex-matched healthy controls were enrolled. For each participant, a frailty assessment using Fried's criteria and comprehensive neuropsychological testing using the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-III and Cognitive Ability Screening Instrument were conducted, and structural brain MR images were acquired for voxel-based morphometric analysis. The neuropsychological testing includes various tests in these five domains: attention, executive, memory, speech and language, and visuospatial functions. Exploratory group-wise comparisons of gray matter volume (GMV) in the PD patients and controls were conducted. Voxel-wise multiple linear regression analyses were conducted for physical frailty-related and cognitive impairment-related GMV changes in the PD patients. Voxel-wise multiple linear regressions were also performed with the five cognitive domains separated using the same model.\nThe PD patients exhibited diffuse GMV reductions in comparison to the controls. In the PD patients, physical frailty-related decreases in GMV were observed in the bilateral frontal and occipital cortices, while cognitive impairment-related decreases in GMV were observed in the bilateral frontal, occipital, and temporal cortices. These regions overlap in the lateral occipital cortex. After the five domains of cognitive functions were analyzed separately, physical frailty-related decreases in GMV still overlap in lateral occipital cortices with every domain of cognitive impairment-related decreases in GMV.\nReduced GMV in the lateral occipital cortex is associated with cognitive impairment and physical frailty in PD patients.\n\u2022 Physical frailty in PD was associated with decreased GMV in the frontal and occipital cortices, while cognitive impairment was associated with decreased GMV in the frontal, temporal, and occipital cortices. \u2022 Physical frailty and cognitive impairment were both associated with decreased GMV in the lateral occipital cortex, which is part of the ventral object-based visual pathway. \u2022 Decreased GMV in the lateral occipital cortex may serve as a potential imaging biomarker for physical frailty and cognitive impairment in PD.", "The game of chess is the longest-studied domain in the history of artificial intelligence. The strongest programs are based on a combination of sophisticated search techniques, domain-specific adaptations, and handcrafted evaluation functions that have been refined by human experts over several decades. By contrast, the AlphaGo Zero program recently achieved superhuman performance in the game of Go by reinforcement learning from self-play. In this paper, we generalize this approach into a single AlphaZero algorithm that can achieve superhuman performance in many challenging games. Starting from random play and given no domain knowledge except the game rules, AlphaZero convincingly defeated a world champion program in the games of chess and shogi (Japanese chess), as well as Go.", "Childhood abuse and neglect are risk factors for psychotic symptoms. Early adversities may contribute to alterations in neuro/social cognition, which in turn is associated with psychosis. This study explored the possible mediating/moderating role of neuro/social cognition between childhood abuse and neglect on the one hand, and psychotic symptoms on the other.\nThe sampling frame was 1.119 patients with a psychotic disorder. Childhood adversity was evaluated with the Dutch version of the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire. Psychotic symptoms were assessed with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale. Verbal learning-memory, attention-vigilance, working memory, information processing speed, reasoning-problem solving were evaluated as measures of neurocognition using the Word Learning Task, the Continuous Performance Test, the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale 3rd. Mentalization was evaluated as a measure of social cognition using the Hinting Task. Correlation, mediation, moderation, 95% Bias Corrected and accelerated (BCaCI) bootstrapped analyses were performed, considering possible sex differences.\nIn male psychotic patients, attention and vigilance mediated the association between childhood neglect and negative symptoms (indirect effect: 0.18, BCaCI: 0.03-0.54), disorganization (indirect effect: 0.26, BCaCI: 0.05-0.61), excitement (indirect effect: 0.07, BCaCI: 0.004-0.23); mentalization mediated the association between childhood neglect and negative symptoms (indirect effect: 0.21, BCaCI: 0.02-0.51), excitement (indirect effect: 0.07, BCaCI: 0.01-0.20) disorganization (indirect effect: 0.29, BCaCI: 0.02-0.64); working memory mediated the association between childhood abuse and disorganization (indirect effect: 0.28, BCaCI: 0.05-0.57), excitement (indirect effect: 0.08, BCaCI: 0.01-0.20), emotional distress (indirect effect: 0.10, BCaCI: 0.01-0.27).\nIn psychotic disorder, sex-specific mediation of neurocognition and mentalization may exist in the association between childhood adversity and psychotic symptoms.", "Accumulating evidence suggests that breastfeeding benefits children's intelligence, possibly due to long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFAs) present in breast milk. Under a nutritional adequacy hypothesis, an interaction between breastfeeding and genetic variants associated with endogenous LC-PUFAs synthesis might be expected. However, the literature on this topic is controversial.\nWe investigated this gene \u00d7 environment interaction through a collaborative effort. The primary analysis involved >12\u00a0000 individuals and used ever breastfeeding, FADS2 polymorphisms rs174575 and rs1535 coded assuming a recessive effect of the G allele, and intelligence quotient (IQ) in Z scores.\nThere was no strong evidence of interaction, with pooled covariate-adjusted interaction coefficients (i.e. difference between genetic groups of the difference in IQ Z scores comparing ever with never breastfed individuals) of 0.12[(95% confidence interval (CI): -0.19; 0.43] and 0.06 (95% CI: -0.16; 0.27) for the rs174575 and rs1535 variants, respectively. Secondary analyses corroborated these results. In studies with \u22655.85 and <5.85\u2009months of breastfeeding duration, pooled estimates for the rs174575 variant were 0.50 (95% CI: -0.06; 1.06) and 0.14 (95% CI: -0.10; 0.38), respectively, and 0.27 (95% CI: -0.28; 0.82) and -0.01 (95% CI: -0.19; 0.16) for the rs1535 variant.\nOur findings did not support an interaction between ever breastfeeding and FADS2 polymorphisms. However, subgroup analysis suggested that breastfeeding may supply LC-PUFAs requirements for cognitive development if breastfeeding lasts for some (currently unknown) time. Future studies in large individual-level datasets would allow properly powered subgroup analyses and further improve our understanding on the breastfeeding \u00d7 FADS2 interaction.", "Freshwater biodiversity is declining, despite national and international efforts to manage and protect freshwater ecosystems. Ecosystem-based management (EBM) has been proposed as an approach that could more efficiently and adaptively balance ecological and societal needs. However, this raises the question of how social and ecological objectives can be included in an integrated management plan. Here, we present a generic model-coupling framework tailored to address this question for freshwater ecosystems, using three components: biodiversity, ecosystem services (ESS), and a spatial prioritisation that aims to balance the spatial representation of biodiversity and ESS supply and demand. We illustrate this model-coupling approach within the Danube River Basin using the spatially explicit, potential distribution of (i) 85 fish species as a surrogate for biodiversity as modelled using hierarchical Bayesian models, and (ii) four estimated ESS layers produced by the Artificial Intelligence for Ecosystem Services (ARIES) platform (with ESS supply defined as carbon storage and flood regulation, and demand specified as recreation and water use). These are then used for (iii) a joint spatial prioritisation of biodiversity and ESS employing Marxan with Zones, laying out the spatial representation of multiple management zones. Given the transboundary setting of the Danube River Basin, we also run comparative analyses including the country-level purchasing power parity (PPP)-adjusted gross domestic product (GDP) and each country's percent cover of the total basin area as potential cost factors, illustrating a scheme for balancing the share of establishing specific zones among countries. We demonstrate how emphasizing various biodiversity or ESS targets in an EBM model-coupling framework can be used to cost-effectively test various spatially explicit management options across a multi-national case study. We further discuss possible limitations, future developments, and requirements for effectively managing a balance between biodiversity and ESS supply and demand in freshwater ecosystems.", "Dixon, Belisle, and Stanley, (2018) demonstrated a strong, significant relationship between derived relational responding and intelligence in individuals with autism. We extended these results by evaluating the degree to which participant results on the PEAK Equivalence Pre-assessment (PEAK-E-PA, a direct assessment of derived relational responding) mediated the relationship between the PEAK Direct Training Assessment (PEAK-DT-A, a Skinnerian-based assessment of verbal development) and intelligence. Results support strong, positive correlations between both assessments (PEAK-DT-A and PEAK-E-PA) and IQ; however, the relationship between PEAK-DT-A and IQ could be explained in terms of participant results on the PEAK-E-PA alone. This finding corresponds with Relational Frame Theory, suggesting that derived responding can provide a behavioral interpretation of intelligent behavior, as well as Skinner's elementary operants.", "The metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a cluster of risk factors for cardiovascular disease associated with reduced physical fitness, higher disease burden, and impaired cognitive functions. Little is known about the operation of these risk factors in older adults when considered comprehensively without relying on the cut-off values of the single MetS components. The three main aims of the current study were to: (i) establish a latent metabolic load factor (MetL), using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), and representing a continuous measure of MetL, defined by indicators that are commonly used to separate MetS groups from healthy individuals; (ii) examine the associations of this MetL factor with objective health, and cognitive function in men and women; (iii) compare the magnitude of these associations to those observed for the individual indicators used to define the MetL factor as well to the classical categorized MetS vs. non-MetS groups. The current analysis is based on cross-sectional data from 1,609 participants of the Berlin Aging Study II (mean age = 68.5 years, SD (3.7); 50.1% female). We applied structural equation modeling (SEM) to establish a latent MetL factor defined by the five indicators commonly used to diagnose MetS. The latent MetL factor was associated with physician-assessed morbidity and kidney function (estimated glomerular filtration rate, eGFR) in both men and women, but not with hand grip strength and lung function (Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second (FEV1)). In addition, we found a negative association between MetL and fluid intelligence among men. A continuous latent variable approach representing the common variance of MetS indicators is well suited to foster our understanding of human aging as a systemic phenomenon in which risk factors are operating on either side of the normal versus pathological divide.", "Highly prevalent and severe sleep-disordered breathing caused by acute cervical spinal cord injury (quadriplegia) is associated with neurocognitive dysfunction and sleepiness and is likely to impair rehabilitation.\nTo determine whether 3\u2009months of autotitrating CPAP would improve neurocognitive function, sleepiness, quality of life, anxiety and depression more than usual care in acute quadriplegia.\nMultinational, randomised controlled trial (11 centres) from July 2009 to October 2015. The primary outcome was neurocognitive (attention and information processing as measure with the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Task). Daytime sleepiness (Karolinska Sleepiness Scale) was a priori identified as the most important secondary outcome.\n1810 incident cases were screened. 332 underwent full, portable polysomnography, 273 of whom had an apnoea hypopnoea index greater than 10. 160 tolerated at least 4\u2009hours of CPAP during a 3-day run-in and were randomised. 149 participants (134 men, age 46\u00b134 years, 81\u00b157 days postinjury) completed the trial. CPAP use averaged 2.9\u00b12.3\u2009hours per night with 21% fully 'adherent' (at least 4\u2009hours use on 5\u2009days per week). Intention-to-treat analyses revealed no significant differences between groups in the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Task (mean improvement of 2.28, 95%\u2009CI -7.09 to 11.6; p=0.63). Controlling for premorbid intelligence, age and obstructive sleep apnoea severity (group effect -1.15, 95% CI -10 to 7.7) did not alter this finding. Sleepiness was significantly improved by CPAP on intention-to-treat analysis (mean difference -1.26, 95% CI -2.2 to -0.32; p=0.01).\nCPAP did not improve Paced Auditory Serial Addition Task scores but significantly reduced sleepiness after acute quadriplegia.\nACTRN12605000799651.", "To elucidate the keywords big data and artificial intelligence and corresponding literature in the field of urolithiasis.\nNumbers of publications on big data and artificial intelligence in the field of urolithiasis are rising, but still low. Most publications describe the development, testing, and validation of automated computational analyses of clinical data sets and/or images in a preclinical setting.\nIn the field of digital health services, there is a discrepancy between the enormous commitment of large private companies and investments of public funds. This situation means a still small number of medical publications on this topic in the urolithiasis field. Nevertheless, as doctors and scientists, we should try to provide our patients with secure and worthwhile digital services.", "Neurodegenerative disease is the umbrella term which refers to a range of clinical conditions causing degeneration of neurons within the central nervous system leading to loss of brain function and eventual death. The most prevalent of these is Alzheimer's disease (AD), which affects approximately 50 million people worldwide and is predicted to reach 75 million by 2030. Neurodegenerative diseases can only be fully diagnosed at post mortem by neuropathological assessment of the type and distribution of protein deposits which characterise each different condition, but there is a clear role for imaging technologies in aiding patient diagnoses in life. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and spectroscopy (MRS) techniques have been applied to study these conditions for many years. In this review, we consider the range of MR-based measurements and describe the findings in AD, but also contrast these with the second most common dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). The most definitive observation is the major structural brain changes seen in AD using conventional T1-weighted (T1w) MRI, where medial temporal lobe structures are notably atrophied in most symptomatic patients with AD, but often preserved in DLB. Indeed these findings are sufficiently robust to have been incorporated into clinical diagnostic criteria. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) reveals widespread changes in tissue microstructure, with increased mean diffusivity and decreased fractional anisotropy reflecting the degeneration of the white matter structures. There are suggestions that there are subtle differences between AD and DLB populations. At the metabolic level, atrophy-corrected MRS demonstrates reduced density of healthy neurons in brain areas with altered perfusion and in regions known to show higher deposits of pathogenic proteins. As studies have moved from patients with advanced disease and clear dysfunction to patients with earlier presentation such as with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), which in some represents the first signs of their ensuing dementia, the ability of MRI to detect differences has been weaker and further work is still required, ideally in much larger cohorts than previously studied. The vast majority of imaging research in dementia populations has been univariate with respect to the MR-derived parameters considered. To date, none of these measurements has uniquely replicated the patterns of tissue involvement seen by neuropathology, and the ability of MR techniques to deliver a non-invasive diagnosis eludes us. Future opportunities may lie in combining MR and nuclear medicine approaches (position emission tomography, PET) to provide a more complete view of structural and metabolic changes. Such developments will require multi-variate analyses, possibly combined with artificial intelligence or deep learning algorithms, to enhance our ability to combine the array of image-derived information, genetic, gender and lifestyle factors.", "Mass spectrometry (MS) is an important technique in protein research. Effective classification methods by MS data could contribute to early and less-invasive diagnosis and also facilitate developments in the bioinformatics field. As MS data is featured by high dimension, appropriate methods which can effectively deal with the large amount of MS data have been widely studied. In this paper, the applications of methods based on intelligence algorithms have been investigated. Firstly, classification and biomarker analysis methods using typical machine learning approaches have been discussed. Then those are followed by the Ensemble strategy algorithms. Clearly, simple and basic machine learning algorithms hardly addressed the various needs of protein MS classification. Preprocessing algorithms have been also studied, as these methods are useful for feature selection or feature extraction to improve classification performance. Protein MS data growing with data volume becomes complicated and large; improvements in classification methods in terms of classifier selection and combinations of different algorithms and preprocessing algorithms are more emphasized in further work.", "The application of artificial intelligence techniques for processing electronic health records data plays increasingly significant role in advancing clinical decision support. This study conducts a quantitative comparison on the research of utilizing artificial intelligence on electronic health records between the USA and China to discovery their research similarities and differences.\nPublications from both Web of Science and PubMed are retrieved to explore the research status and academic performances of the two countries quantitatively. Bibliometrics, geographic visualization, collaboration degree calculation, social network analysis, latent dirichlet allocation, and affinity propagation clustering are applied to analyze research quantity, collaboration relations, and hot research topics.\nThere are 1031 publications from the USA and 173 publications from China during 2008-2017 period. The annual numbers of publications from the USA and China increase polynomially. JAMIA with 135 publications and JBI with 13 publications are the top prolific journals for the USA and China, respectively. Harvard University with 101 publications and Zhejiang University with 12 publications are the top prolific affiliations for the USA and China, respectively. Massachusetts is the most prolific region with 211 publications for the USA, while for China, Taiwan is the top 1 with 47 publications. China has relatively higher institutional and international collaborations. Nine main research areas for the USA are identified, differentiating 7 for China.\nThere is a steadily growing presence and increasing visibility of utilizing artificial intelligence on electronic health records for the USA and China over the years. The results of the study demonstrate the research similarities and differences, as well as strengths and weaknesses of the two countries.", "Precision health (PH) applied to autoimmune disease will need paradigm shifts in the use and application of autoantibodies and other biomarkers. For example, autoantibodies combined with other multi-analyte \"omic\" profiles will form the basis of disease prediction allowing for earlier intervention linked to disease prevention strategies, as well as earlier, effective and personalized interventions for established disease. As medical intervention moves to disease prediction and a model of \"intent to PREVENT,\" diagnostics will include an early symptom/risk-based, as opposed to a disease-based approach. Newer diagnostic platforms that utilize emerging megatrends such as deep learning and artificial intelligence and close the gaps in autoantibody diagnostics will benefit from paradigm shifts thereby facilitating the PH agenda.", "The relationship between sex and creativity remains an unresolved research question. The present study aimed to approach this question through the lens of the developmental theory of sex differences in intelligence, which posits a dynamic pattern of sex differences in intellectual abilities from female superiority in childhood and early adolescence to male superiority starting at 16 years of age. A total of 775 participants from three age groups (i.e., children, adolescents, and emerging adults) completed a 4-year longitudinal study comprising four assessments of creative thinking at 1-year intervals. Creative thinking was assessed with the Test for Creative Thinking-Drawing Production. While the results revealed female superiority in childhood and early adolescence, male superiority was not found in adolescence and emerging adulthood. Rather, greater sex similarities and greater male variability were found based on mean and variability analyses, respectively. This study elucidated the link between sex and creativity by (1) taking a developmental perspective, (2) employing a 4-year longitudinal design in three age groups (i.e., children, adolescents, and emerging adults), and (3) analyzing sex differences based on both mean and variability analyses.", "Historically, culture-based microbiology laboratory testing has relied on manual methods, and automated methods (such as those that have revolutionized clinical chemistry and hematology over the past several decades) were largely absent from the clinical microbiology laboratory. However, an increased demand for microbiology testing and standardization of sample-collection devices for microbiology culture, as well as a dwindling supply of microbiology technologists, has driven the adoption of automated methods for culture-based laboratory testing in clinical microbiology.\nWe describe systems currently enabling total laboratory automation (TLA) for culture-based microbiology testing. We describe the general components of a microbiology automation system and the various functions of these instruments. We then introduce the 2 most widely used systems currently on the market: Becton Dickinson's Kiestra TLA and Copan's WASPLab. We discuss the impact of TLA on metrics such as turnaround time and recovery of microorganisms, providing a review of the current literature and perspectives from laboratory directors, managers, and technical staff. Finally, we provide an outlook for future advances in TLA for microbiology with a focus on artificial intelligence for automated culture interpretation.\nTLA is playing an increasingly important role in clinical microbiology. Although challenges remain, TLA has great potential to affect laboratory efficiency, turnaround time, and the overall quality of culture-based microbiology testing.", "Impairment in cognitive flexibility is a trait characteristic among individuals with diagnosed eating disorders. However, the extent to which these relationships exist in individuals with overweight or obesity remains unclear. Furthermore, there is a lack of knowledge characterizing the neural underpinnings of these relationships. The current study aimed to investigate disordered eating attitudes and cognitive flexibility among adults with overweight and obesity. The Eating Attitudes Test (EAT-26) and a task-switching paradigm were collected from 132 adults (50 males, Body Mass Index (BMI) = 32.0 \u00b1 5.8 kg/m\u00b2). Behavioral measures (accuracy and reaction time (RT)) and neuroelectric indices (amplitude and latency) of the P3 component were assessed. Hierarchical linear regressions, following adjustment of age, sex, intelligence quotient (IQ), weight status, and diet quality were developed using summative and subscale scores of the EAT-26. Higher EAT-26 summative scores, and the Dieting subscale, were related to longer RT. Only the Bulimia and Food Preoccupation subscale was related to longer P3 latency. The relationship between disordered eating attitudes and cognitive flexibility extends to individuals with overweight and obesity and is independent of age, sex, IQ, weight status, and diet quality. These findings are important, as differences in cognitive flexibility can lead to behavioral rigidity. Future work should aim to examine other neuroelectric components to identify where differences driving behavioral latencies may be occurring.", "Neurocysticercosis (NCC) produces a progressive organic brain damage by altering brain function with alterations in memory, difficulties in learning, and behavioral changes. The present study was designed to compare the cognitive and behavioral profile of school-going children aged 6-14 years with newly diagnosed NCC with their age-matched controls.\nA descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted among children aged 6-14 years with newly (<7 days) diagnosed NCC. Age- and gender-matched typically developing children with minor illness attending outpatient facility served as control. Intelligence and behavioral assessment were performed using Malin's Intelligence Scale for Indian Children and Childhood Behavior Checklist (CBCL) (school age version CBCL/6-18). CBCL T-scores were computed and scores < 60 were considered as normal, 60-63 as borderline, and > 63 as clinical range.\nA total of 35 cases and 35 controls were enrolled. Baseline demographic characteristics were comparable between the two groups. Verbal intelligence quotient (IQ) scores were comparable between the cases (96.14 [10.23]) and controls (100.17 [10.89]) (P = 0.11). The behavioral assessment revealed normal T-scores (<60) in both the groups.\nThe study revealed comparable IQ and normal behavioral profile of treatment-na\u00efve children with recently diagnosed NCC to their age-matched peers. Further studies with larger sample size and longitudinal study design are required to evaluate the role of NCC on cognition and behavior in Indian children.", "Epidemiological studies have demonstrated a relationship between cognitive function in youth and the future risk of death. Less is known regarding the relationship with diabetes related death. This study assessed the relationship between cognitive function in late adolescence and the risk for diabetes, cardiovascular- (CVD) and all-cause mortality in adulthood.\nThis retrospective study linked data from 2,277,188 16-19\u00a0year olds who had general intelligence tests (GIT) conducted during pre-military recruitment assessment with cause of death as coded by the Israel Central Bureau of Statistics. The associations between cognitive function and cause-specific mortality were assessed using Cox models.\nThere were 31,268 deaths that were recorded during 41,916,603 person-years of follow-up, with a median follow-up of 19.2 (IQR 10.7, 29.5) years. 3068, 1443, 514 and 457 deaths were attributed to CVD, CHD, stroke, and diabetes, respectively. Individuals in the lowest GIT vs. highest GIT quintiles in unadjusted models had the highest risk for all-cause mortality (HR 1.84, 95% CI 1.78, 1.91), total CVD (HR 3.32, 95% CI 2.93, 3.75), CHD (HR 3.49 95% CI 2.92, 4.18), stroke (HR 3.96 95% CI 2.85, 5.5) and diabetes-related (HR 6.96 95% CI 4.68, 10.36) mortality. These HRs were attenuated following adjustment for age, sex, birth year, body-mass index, residential socioeconomic status, education and country of origin for all-cause (HR 1.23, 95% CI 1.17, 1.28), CVD (HR 1.76, 95% CI 1.52, 2.04), CHD (HR 1.7 95% CI 1.37, 2.11), stroke (HR 2.03, 95% CI 1.39, 2.98) and diabetes-related (HR 3.14 95% CI 2.00, 4.94) mortality. Results persisted in a sensitivity analyses limited to participants with unimpaired health at baseline and that accounted competing risk.\nThis analysis of over 2 million demonstrates a strong relationship between cognitive function at youth and the risk for diabetes, all-cause and CVD-related mortality\u00a0independent of adolescent obesity.", "Many novel therapeutic options for depression exist that are either not mentioned in clinical guidelines or recommended only for use in highly specialist services.

Population health is in everybody's interest, but nobody is really in charge of promoting it. Across governments, corporations, and frontline operations, lack of coordination, lack of resources, and lack of reliable, current information have often impeded the development of situation-awareness models and thus a broad operational integration for population health. These deficiencies may also affect the technical, organizational, policy, and legal arrangements for information sharing, a desired practice of high potential value in population health. In this article, we articulate a vision for a next-generation modeling effort to create a systems architecture for broadly integrating and visualizing strategies for advancing population health. This multipurpose systems architecture would enable different views, alerts, and scenarios to better prepare for and respond to potential degradations in population health. We draw inspiration from systems engineering and visualization tools currently in other uses, including monitoring the state of the economy (market performance), security (classified intelligence), energy (power generation), transportation (global air traffic control), environment (weather monitoring), jobs (labor market dynamics), manufacturing and supply chain (tracking of components, parts, subassemblies, and products), and democratic processes (election analytics). We envision the basic ingredients for a population health systems architecture and its visualization dashboards to eventually support proactive planning and joint action among constituents. We intend our ambitious vision to encourage the work needed for progress that the population deserves.", "Artificial intelligence allows machines to predict human faculties such as image and voice recognition. Can machines be taught to measure pain? We argue that the two fundamental requirements for a device with 'pain biomarker' capabilities are hardware and software. We discuss the merits and limitations of electroencephalography (EEG) as the hardware component of a putative embodiment of the device, and advances in the application of machine learning approaches to EEG for predicting pain.", "Independent exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) research with the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Fifth Edition (WISC-V) standardization sample has failed to provide support for the five group factors proposed by the publisher, but there have been no independent examinations of the WISC-V structure among clinical samples. The present study examined the latent structure of the 10 WISC-V primary subtests with a large (N = 2,512), bifurcated clinical sample (EFA, n = 1,256; CFA, n = 1,256). EFA did not support five factors as there were no salient subtest factor pattern coefficients on the fifth extracted factor. EFA indicated a four-factor model resembling the WISC-IV with a dominant general factor. A bifactor model with four group factors was supported by CFA as suggested by EFA. Variance estimates from both EFA and CFA found that the general intelligence factor dominated subtest variance and omega-hierarchical coefficients supported interpretation of the general intelligence factor. In both EFA and CFA, group factors explained small portions of common variance and produced low omega-hierarchical subscale coefficients, indicating that the group factors were of poor interpretive value.", "The NIH Toolbox Cognition Battery (NIHTB-CB) is a computer-based protocol not yet validated for clinical assessment.\nWe administered the NIHTB-CB and traditional neuropsychological tests to 247 Memory Disorders and Alzheimer's Prevention Clinic patients with subjective cognitive decline, mild cognitive impairment, mild dementia due to Alzheimer's disease, and normal cognition. Principal component analysis, partial correlations, and univariate general linear model tests were performed to assess construct validity. Discriminant function analyses compared classification accuracy.\nPrincipal component analysis identified three conceptually coherent factors: memory (MEMNIH), executive function (EFNIH), and crystallized intelligence (CINIH). These factors were strongly associated with corresponding traditional tests and differed across diagnostic groups as expected. Both NIHTB and traditional batteries yielded strong overall discriminative ability (>80%).\nThe NIHTB-CB is a valid method to assess neurocognitive domains pertinent to aging and dementia and has utility for applications in a memory clinic setting.", "Conventional machine learning approaches for predicting material properties from elemental compositions have emphasized the importance of leveraging domain knowledge when designing model inputs. Here, we demonstrate that by using a deep learning approach, we can bypass such manual feature engineering requiring domain knowledge and achieve much better results, even with only a few thousand training samples. We present the design and implementation of a deep neural network model referred to as ElemNet; it automatically captures the physical and chemical interactions and similarities between different elements using artificial intelligence which allows it to predict the materials properties with better accuracy and speed. The speed and best-in-class accuracy of ElemNet enable us to perform a fast and robust screening for new material candidates in a huge combinatorial space; where we predict hundreds of thousands of chemical systems that could contain yet-undiscovered compounds.", "Despite significant advances in orthopaedic surgery, variability still exists between providers and practice locations, and process inefficiencies are found throughout the health care continuum. Evolving technologies, namely artificial intelligence, challenge the status quo by improving patient care in four areas: diagnosis, management, research and systems analysis. Artificial intelligence shows promise in promoting practice efficiency, personalizing patient care, improving institutional research capacity, and expanding high quality orthopaedic care to lower resource settings. Physicians should be involved in the development of artificial intelligence algorithms to ensure that patients derive maximum benefit from new advances while considering the ethical challenges of implementation.", "The automated home referred to as Smart Home is expected to offer fully customized services to its residents, reducing the amount of home labor, thus improving human beings' welfare. Service robots and Internet of Things (IoT) play the key roles in the development of Smart Home. The service provision with these two main components in a Smart Home environment requires: 1) learning and reasoning algorithms and 2) the integration of robot and IoT systems. Conventional computational intelligence-based learning and reasoning algorithms do not successfully manage dynamic changes in the Smart Home data, and the simple integrations fail to fully draw the synergies from the collaboration of the two systems. To tackle these limitations, we propose: 1) a stabilized memory network with a feedback mechanism which can learn user behaviors in an incremental manner and 2) a robot-IoT service provision framework for a Smart Home which utilizes the proposed memory architecture as a learning and reasoning module and exploits synergies between the robot and IoT systems. We conduct a set of comprehensive experiments under various conditions to verify the performance of the proposed memory architecture and the service provision framework and analyze the experiment results.", "Face recognition skills vary considerably both in the normal population and in various clinical groups, and understanding the cognitive mechanisms contributing to this variability is important. In the present study, we investigate whether a group of good face recognizers (high performers; HPs) perform qualitatively differently from a control group on tests of face, object and word recognition, and also compare them to a group of developmental prosopagnosics (DPs). Through a series of experiments, we (i) examine whether HPs are better than control subjects in face and object recognition, (ii) investigate if any dissociations among face, object, and word processing tasks can be demonstrated in the HPs, and (iii) compare the performance of the HPs to a group of poor face recognizers namely a group of DPs. Data from this DP group have previously been reported, but the analyses presented here are new. We find that HPs were significantly better than matched control subjects on tests of face and object recognition including a reading task, but they did not show significantly larger inversion effects on typical tests of face processing (the CFMT and the CFPT). There was no evidence of dissociations between face and object processing in the HPs when compared to controls, indicating superior performance across visual domains. In the DP group, however, we found significant dissociations between face and object recognition performance on a group level, indicating that face processing is disproportionally affected. On this basis, we propose that superior face processing in HPs rely on more general cognitive or perceptual processes shared with object processing. Hence, while face processing in DPs seems qualitatively different from the normal population, there is no such difference between average and high performing face recognizers. Thus, what underlies superior face processing in HPs might also underlie their superior performance with other stimulus classes and might be conceived as a general factor in the visual domain, a VG-factor, akin to the G factor in intelligence.", "Aesthetic surgery procedures such as lip augmentation, eyelid correction, face-lifting, or Botox treatment for lines and wrinkles are an important part of cosmetic surgery.\nThe aim of the study was to estimate improvement in appearance following plastic surgery using modern collective intelligence methods of validation.\nA total of 108 photographs showing 54 patients prior to and following cosmetic surgery were downloaded from Internet web presentations of several unnamed plastic surgeons. The same number of photographs depicted each of the four investigated areas of treatment-26 lip enhancement, 26 blepharoplasty, 26 face-lift, 26 botulinum toxin injection. Attractiveness of depicted individuals was assessed by 167 observers. Each photograph was judged separately.\nBlepharoplasty produced the most remarkable improvement in attractiveness amounting to 32.79 (SD\u00a0\u00b1\u00a026.35). Improvement following Botox treatment stood at 30.29 (SD\u00a0\u00b1\u00a024.55), whereas face-lifting produces improvement of 28.70 (SD\u00a0\u00b1\u00a022.76). Improvement following lip augmentation was estimated at 12.70 (SD\u00a0\u00b1\u00a029.8). Highest Spearman's rank correlation coefficient was obtained for face-lift and Botox (0.24 and 0.22, respectively).\nBlepharoplasty, face-lifting, and Botox deliver a significant improvement in facial attractiveness. Additionally, face-lifting and Botox are distinguished by a high level of reproducibility. Our results indicate that lip augmentation is a treatment with a statistically significant, but less marked improvement in attractiveness.", "In this cross-sectional study, we sought to describe cognitive and neuroimaging profiles of Memory clinic patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). 51 MCI patients and 51 controls, matched on age, sex, and socio-economic status (SES), were assessed with an extensive neuropsychological test battery that included a measure of intelligence (General Ability Index, \"GAI,\" from WAIS-IV), and structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MCI subtypes were determined after inclusion, and z-scores normalized to our control group were generated for each cognitive domain in each MCI participant. MR-images were scored by visual rating scales. MCI patients performed significantly worse than controls on 23 of 31 cognitive measures (Bonferroni corrected p = 0.001), and on 8 of 31 measures after covarying for intelligence (GAI). Compared to nonamnestic MCI patients, amnestic MCI patients had lower test results in 13 of 31 measures, and 5 of 31 measures after co-varying for GAI. Compared to controls, the MCI patients had greater atrophy on Schelten's Medial temporal lobe atrophy score (MTA), especially in those with amnestic MCI. The only structure-function correlation that remained significant after correction for multiple comparisons was the MTA-long delay recall domain. Intelligence operationalized as GAI appears to be an important moderator of the neuropsychological outcomes. Atrophy of the medial temporal lobe, based on MTA scores, may be a sensitive biomarker for the functional episodic memory deficits associated with MCI.", "One of the areas of social cognition is Theory of Mind (ToM) is defined as the capacity to interpret, infer and explain mental states underlying the behavior of others. When social cognition studies on neurodevelopmental disorders are examined, it can be seen that this skill has not been studied sufficiently in children with Specific Learning Disorder (SLD).\nIn this study, social cognition skills in children diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), SLD or Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) evaluated before puberty and compared with controls. To evaluate the ToM skills, the first and secondorder false belief tasks, the Hinting Task, the Faux Pas Test and the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Task were used.\nWe found that children with neurodevelopmental disorders as ADHD, ASD, and SLD had ToM deficits independent of intelligence and language development. There was a significant correlation between social cognition deficits and problems experienced in many areas such as social communication and interaction, attention, behavior, and learning.\nSocial cognition is an important area of impairment in SLD and there is a strong relationship between clinical symptoms and impaired functionality.", "The past few years have seen a considerable rise in interest towards artificial intelligence and machine learning applications in radiology. However, in order for such systems to perform adequately, large amounts of training data are required. These data should ideally be standardised and of adequate quality to allow for further usage in training of artificial intelligence algorithms. Unfortunately, in many current clinical and radiological information technology ecosystems, access to relevant pieces of information is difficult. This is mostly because a significant portion of information is handled as a collection of narrative texts and interoperability is still lacking. This review aims at giving a brief overview on how structured reporting can help to facilitate research in artificial intelligence and the context of big data.", "The link between neuropsychological impairments and chronic tobacco smoking is not clear and in the current literature there is a lack of robust analyses investigating this association. A systematic review of the literature was conducted in order to identify relevant longitudinal and cross-sectional studies conducted from 1946 to 2017. A meta-analysis was performed from 24 studies testing the performance of chronic tobacco smokers compared with non-smokers on neuropsychological tests related to eight different neuropsychological domains. The results revealed a cross-sectional association between neuropsychological impairments and chronic tobacco smoking in cognitive impulsivity, non-planning impulsivity, attention, intelligence, short term memory, long term memory, and cognitive flexibility, with the largest effect size being related to cognitive impulsivity (SDM\u2009=\u20090.881, p <0.005), and the smallest effect size being related to intelligence (SDM\u2009=\u20090.164, p\u2009<\u20090.05) according to Cohen's benchmark criteria. No association was found between chronic smoking and motor impulsivity (SDM\u2009=\u20090.105, p\u2009=\u20090.248). Future research is needed to investigate further this association by focusing on better methodologies and alternative methods for nicotine administration.", "Three-dimensional camera systems that integrate depth assessment with traditional two-dimensional images, such as the Microsoft Kinect, Intel Realsense, StereoLabs Zed and Orbecc, hold great promise as physical function assessment tools. When combined with point cloud and skeleton pose tracking software they can be used to assess many different aspects of physical function and anatomy. These assessments have received great interest over the past decade, and will likely receive further study as the integration of depth sensing and augmented reality smartphone cameras occurs more in everyday life.\nThe aim of this review is to discuss how these devices work, what options are available, the best methods for performing assessments and how they can be used in the future.\nFirstly, a review of the Microsoft Kinect devices and associated artificial intelligence, automated skeleton tracking algorithms is provided. This includes a narrative critique of the validity and clinical utility of these devices for assessing different aspects of physical function including spatiotemporal, kinematic and inverse dynamics data derived from gait and balance trials, and anatomical assessments performed using the depth sensor information. Methods for improving the accuracy of data are examined, including multiple-camera systems and sensor fusion with inertial monitoring units, model fitting, and marker tracking. Secondly, alternative hardware, including other structured light and time of flight methods, stereoscopic cameras and augmented reality leveraging smartphone and tablet cameras to perform measurements in three-dimensional space are summarised. Software options related to depth sensing cameras are then discussed, focussing on recent advances such as OpenPose and web-based methods such as PoseNet.\nThe clinical and non-laboratory utility of these devices holds great promise for physical function assessment, and recent developments could strengthen their ability to provide important and impactful health-related data.", "With this prospective, observational study, we aimed to determine whether noninvasive language tasks, developed specifically for children, could reliably identify the hemisphere of seizure onset in pediatric epilepsy.\nSeventy-eight children with unilateral epilepsy (44 left), aged 6-15 years (mean age = 11.8, SD = 2.6), completed the Children's Auditory Naming and Visual Naming Tests, the Boston Naming Test, and other verbal and nonverbal tasks. Multivariate analysis of variance was used to compare test performance between left and right hemisphere epilepsy groups, and \u03c72 analyses and odds ratios were used to examine classification of left vs right hemisphere epilepsy for individual patients based on test performance.\nGroup comparisons revealed poorer auditory naming in children with left hemisphere epilepsy (p = 0.02), yet no significant differences on measures of visual naming, general intelligence, or other cognitive functions. Moreover, \u03c72 analyses using auditory naming cutoff scores to define intact vs impaired performance correctly classified seizure laterality in a significant proportion of children (p = 0.004). The odds of left hemisphere epilepsy were 4.2 times higher (95% confidence interval 1.4-11.7) than the odds of right hemisphere epilepsy with poor auditory naming performance. In the subset of patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), the odds of left TLE were 11.3 times higher (95% confidence interval 2.00-63.17) than the odds of right TLE with poor auditory naming performance.\nContrary to previous findings, naming performance can lateralize hemisphere of seizure onset in children with epilepsy, thereby assisting in the preoperative workup for pediatric epilepsy surgery.", "Certain future scenarios of technological change are dystopian in their predictions. Fewer are optimistic. Taking a pragmatic stance, this paper seeks to identify certain key threats associated with the proliferation of dangerous technologies, giving voice to those in the literature on different sides of the debate. Novel literature is considered that suggests that innovations in the discovery, or research process itself, may hold the key to developing certain collaborative capabilities that can amplify collective intelligence. These capabilities are discussed together with their potential to meet the challenges associated with the proliferation of dangerous technologies. Testable propositions are derived from literature, and four technological scenarios are developed for analysis. Certain key challenges are identified and discussed in relation to each of the technological scenarios. In doing so, what are hopefully useful insights are derived for how changes can be made in the present to help avoid meeting the fates described by certain of these scenarios.", "A World Health Organization workshop systematically examined the evidence base for dosing second-line tuberculosis drugs, identifying knowledge gaps. To fill these in, pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics, Monte Carlo experiments, and artificial intelligence algorithms were used in hollow-fiber model studies and clinical data analyses.", "Pneumonia is one of the major causes of child mortality, yet with a timely diagnosis, it is usually curable with antibiotic therapy. In many developing regions, diagnosing pneumonia remains a challenge, due to shortages of medical resources. Lung ultrasound has proved to be a useful tool to detect lung consolidation as evidence of pneumonia. However, diagnosis of pneumonia by ultrasound has limitations: it is operator-dependent, and it needs to be carried out and interpreted by trained personnel. Pattern recognition and image analysis is a potential tool to enable automatic diagnosis of pneumonia consolidation without requiring an expert analyst. This paper presents a method for automatic classification of pneumonia using ultrasound imaging of the lungs and pattern recognition. The approach presented here is based on the analysis of brightness distribution patterns present in rectangular segments (here called \"characteristic vectors\") from the ultrasound digital images. In a first step we identified and eliminated the skin and subcutaneous tissue (fat and muscle) in lung ultrasound frames, and the \"characteristic vectors\"were analyzed using standard neural networks using artificial intelligence methods. We analyzed 60 lung ultrasound frames corresponding to 21 children under age 5 years (15 children with confirmed pneumonia by clinical examination and X-rays, and 6 children with no pulmonary disease) from a hospital based population in Lima, Peru. Lung ultrasound images were obtained using an Ultrasonix ultrasound device. A total of 1450 positive (pneumonia) and 1605 negative (normal lung) vectors were analyzed with standard neural networks, and used to create an algorithm to differentiate lung infiltrates from healthy lung. A neural network was trained using the algorithm and it was able to correctly identify pneumonia infiltrates, with 90.9% sensitivity and 100% specificity. This approach may be used to develop operator-independent computer algorithms for pneumonia diagnosis using ultrasound in young children.", "General cognitive (intelligence) function is substantially heritable, and is a major determinant of economic and health-related life outcomes. Cognitive impairments and intelligence decline are core features of schizophrenia which are evident before the onset of the illness. Genetic overlaps between cognitive impairments and the vulnerability for the illness have been suggested. Here, we review the literature on recent large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of general cognitive function and correlations between cognitive function and genetic susceptibility to schizophrenia. In the last decade, large-scale GWASs (n > 30,000) of general cognitive function and schizophrenia have demonstrated that substantial proportions of the heritability of the cognitive function and schizophrenia are explained by a polygenic component consisting of many common genetic variants with small effects. To date, GWASs have identified more than 100 loci linked to general cognitive function and 108 loci linked to schizophrenia. These genetic variants are mostly intronic or intergenic. Genes identified around these genetic variants are densely expressed in brain tissues. Schizophrenia-related genetic risks are consistently correlated with lower general cognitive function (rg = -0.20) and higher educational attainment (rg = 0.08). Cognitive functions are associated with many of the socioeconomic and health-related outcomes. Current treatment strategies largely fail to improve cognitive impairments of schizophrenia. Therefore, further study is needed to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying both cognition and schizophrenia.", "The APA Awards for Distinguished Scientific Early Career Contributions to Psychology recognize psychologists who have demonstrated excellence early in their careers and have held a doctoral degree for no more than 9 years. One of the 2018 award winners is Fiery A. Cushman, \"for his groundbreaking research in moral psychology, integrating ideas from cognitive, social, and developmental psychology; moral and legal philosophy; evolutionary biology; cognitive neuroscience; and artificial intelligence. Cushman's award citation, biography, and a selected bibliography are presented here. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved).", "Down (DS) and Prader-Willi (PWS) syndromes are chromosomal disorders both characterized by obesity, ligament laxity, and hypotonia, the latter associated with gait instability. Although these shared features may justify a common rehabilitation approach, evidence exists that adults with DS and PWS adopt different postural and walking strategies. The development of an instrumented protocol able to describe these strategies and quantify patients' gait stability in the current clinical routine would be of great benefit for health professionals, allowing them to design personalized rehabilitation programs. This is particularly true for children with DS and PWS, where motor development is dramatically constrained by severe hypotonia and muscle weakness. The aim of this study was, thus, to propose an instrumented protocol, integrated with the clinical routine and based on the use of wearable inertial sensors, to assess gait stability in DS and PWS children. Fifteen children with DS, 11 children with PWS, and 12 typically developing children (CG) were involved in the study. Participants performed a 10-meter walking test while wearing four inertial sensors located at pelvis, sternum, and both distal tibiae levels. Spatiotemporal parameters (walking speed, stride frequency, and stride length) and a set of indices related to gait symmetry and upper-body stability (Root Mean Square, Attenuation Coefficient and Improved Harmonic Ratio) were estimated from pelvis and sternum accelerations. The Gross Motor Functional Measures (GMFM-88) and Intelligence Quotient (IQ Wechsler) were also assessed for each patient. A correlation analysis among the GMFM-88 and IQ scales and the estimated parameters was then performed. Children with DS and PWS exhibit reduced gait symmetry and higher accelerations at pelvis level than CG. While these accelerations are attenuated by about 40% at sternum level in CG and DS, PWS children display significant smaller attenuations, thus reporting reduced gait stability, most likely due to their typical \"Trendelenburg gait\". Significant correlations were found between the estimated parameters and the GMFM-88 scale when considering the whole PWS and DS group and the PWS group alone. These results promote the adoption of wearable technology in clinical routines to monitor gait patterns in children with DS and PWS: the proposed protocol allows to markedly characterize patient-specific motor limitations even when clinical assessment scores provide similar results in terms of pathology severity. This protocol could be adopted to support health professionals in designing personalized treatments that, in turn, could help improving patients' quality of life in terms of both physical and social perspectives.", "The negative effect of lead exposure on children's intelligence is well-documented. Less is known about the impact of lead on the use of executive functions to self-regulate behavior. We measured blood lead level (BLL) in a sample of first grade children from Montevideo, Uruguay (n = 206, age 6.7 \u00b1 0.5 years, 59.7% boys). Behavior was assessed with teacher versions of the Conners Rating Scale (CRS) and the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Functions (BRIEF). Mean BLL was 4.2 \u00b1 2.1 \u03bcg/dL; 10% had mild-to-severe ratings of Attentional Deficit with Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) (T score > 65). In negative binomial regression, BLL was not associated with CRS sub-scales, but was associated with a poorer ability to inhibit inappropriate behaviors, prevalence ratio (PR) [95% CI]: 1.01 [1.00, 1.03] as measured by the BRIEF. In covariate-adjusted models, the association with BLL was attenuated. When stratified by sex, the covariate-adjusted association between BLL, hyperactivity, poorer inhitibion, emotional control, and behavioral regulation was marginally significant for girls but not boys. In summary, among children with low lead-exposure, we found some, but nonetheless modest, evidence of a relationship between higher BLL and child behavior. If confirmed by larger studies and other objective measures of behavior, such links could have implications for learning and social interaction, particularly among girls.", "High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) has revolutionized the diagnosis, prognosis and in some cases the prediction of therapeutic response in interstitial lung disease (ILD). HRCT represents an essential second step to a patient's clinical history, before considering any other investigation, including lung biopsy. Areas covered: This review describes the current place of HRCT in the diagnosis, prognosis and monitoring of ILD. It also lists some perspectives for the near future. Expert commentary: Since the 1980s, HRCT and its interpretation have improved, the diagnosis value of patterns, and the integration of bio-clinical elements to HRCT have been better standardized. The interobserver agreement has been investigated, allowing a better use of some limits in the interpretation of various signs. It not only takes into account one particular predominant sign, but the combination of patterns and the distribution of findings. Thanks to HRCT, the range of diagnoses and their probability are more accurately identified. The contribution of HRCT has been optimized during the multidisciplinary discussion that a difficult diagnosis calls for. HRCT quantification of the extent of diffuse lung disease becomes possible and is linked to prognosis. In the future, artificial intelligence may significantly modify the practice of radiology.", "This study calculates cigarette affordability for 78 countries worldwide from 2001 to 2014 using the Relative Income Price (RIP) ratio defined as the percentage of per capita GDP required to purchase 100 packs of cigarettes using the lowest price from Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) database, examine the association between cigarette affordability and cigarette consumption, and calculate the affordability elasticity of demand.\nRIP (2001-2014) was calculated for 16 low-income economies, 19 lower middle-income economies, 13 upper middle-income economies, and 30 high-income economies. Ordinary least square regressions were used to analyze the association between cigarette affordability and consumption.\nPer capita consumption continued to rise in low-income countries and decreased slightly in lower middle-income countries as the RIP of cigarette consistently declined in low- and lower middle-income economies from 2001 to 2014. The real cigarette prices continued to decline in low- and lower middle-income countries and continued to rise in upper middle- and high-income countries. Though cigarettes were more expensive in HICs than were in LMICs, cigarettes were more affordable in HICs than were in LMICs. The regression results show a 10% increase in the RIP of cigarettes led to a 2% decrease in per capita consumption. The affordability elasticity of demand differed significantly between HICs and LMICs. However, the effect of cigarette affordability on consumption has not changed over time.\nTo control the smoking epidemic, low- and lower middle-income countries should further increase cigarette prices. The rate of price increase should exceed the rate of economic growth and outpace the inflation rate to make cigarettes less affordable and thereby reducing tobacco use.", "Since the early 1980s, most electronics have relied on the use of complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) transistors. However, the principles of CMOS operation, involving a switchable semiconductor conductance controlled by an insulating gate, have remained largely unchanged, even as transistors are miniaturized to sizes of 10 nanometres. We investigated\u00a0what\u00a0dimensionally scalable logic technology beyond CMOS could provide improvements in efficiency and performance for von Neumann architectures and enable growth in emerging\u00a0computing such as artifical intelligence. Such a\u00a0computing technology needs to allow progressive miniaturization, reduce switching energy, improve device interconnection and provide a complete logic and memory family. Here we propose a scalable spintronic logic device that operates via spin-orbit transduction (the coupling of an electron's angular momentum with its linear momentum) combined with magnetoelectric switching. The device uses advanced quantum materials, especially correlated oxides and topological states of matter, for collective switching and detection. We describe progress in magnetoelectric switching and spin-orbit detection of state, and show that in comparison with CMOS technology our device has superior switching energy (by a factor of 10 to 30), lower switching voltage (by a factor of 5) and enhanced logic density (by a factor of 5). In addition, its non-volatility enables ultralow standby power, which is critical to modern computing. The properties of our device indicate that the proposed technology could enable the development of multi-generational computing.", "Hirschsprung disease (HSCR) has previously been associated with increased need of special education services despite normal intelligence. The aim of this study was to assess the risk of attention deficit hyperactivity disorders (ADHD) in individuals with HSCR in a population-based cohort.\nThis was a nationwide, population-based cohort study. The study exposure was HSCR and the study outcome was ADHD. The cohort included all individuals with HSCR registered in the Swedish National Patient Register between 1964 and 2013 and ten age- and sex-matched controls per patient, randomly selected from the Population Register.\nThe cohort comprised 739 individuals with HSCR and 7390 controls. Twenty-six of the 739 individuals with HSCR and 202 of the 7390 controls were diagnosed with ADHD, Odds ratio (OR) 1.30, Confidence interval (CI) 95% 0.84-1.93, indicating no difference in risk for ADHD. The mean age at diagnosis of ADHD was not different between the groups; 18.1\u202fyears (SD 8.4) vs 16.7\u202fyears (SD 7.8), p\u202f=\u202f0.39. Down syndrome did not affect the risk for ADHD, OR 2.26 (CI 95% 0.68-5.53). Female gender decreased the risk for ADHD, OR 0.58 (CI 95% 0.40-0.83).\nThere is no increased risk of ADHD in patients with Hirschsprung disease.\nPrognosis study, level of evidence: Level I.", "In natural environments with many options of uncertain value, one faces a difficult tradeoff between exploiting familiar, valuable options or searching for better alternatives. Reinforcement learning models of this exploration/exploitation dilemma typically modulate the rate of exploratory choices or preferentially sample uncertain options. The extent to which such models capture human behavior remains unclear, in part because they do not consider the constraints on remembering what is learned. Using reinforcement-based timing as a motivating example, we show that selectively maintaining high-value actions compresses the amount of information to be tracked in learning, as quantified by Shannon's entropy. In turn, the information content of the value representation controls the balance between exploration (high entropy) and exploitation (low entropy). Selectively maintaining preferred action values while allowing others to decay renders the choices increasingly exploitative across learning episodes. To adjudicate among alternative maintenance and sampling strategies, we developed a new reinforcement learning model, StrategiC ExPloration/ExPloitation of Temporal Instrumental Contingencies (SCEPTIC). In computational studies, a resource-rational selective maintenance approach was as successful as more resource-intensive strategies. Furthermore, human behavior was consistent with selective maintenance; information compression was most pronounced in subjects with superior performance and non-verbal intelligence, and in learnable vs. unlearnable contingencies. Cognitively demanding uncertainty-directed exploration recovered a more accurate representation in simulations with no foraging advantage and was strongly unsupported in our human study.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) is a field of mathematical engineering which has potential to enhance healthcare through new care delivery strategies, informed decision making and facilitation of patient engagement. Machine learning (ML) is a form of narrow artificial intelligence which can be used to automate decision making and make predictions based upon patient data.\nThis review outlines key applications of supervised and unsupervised machine learning in musculoskeletal medicine; such as diagnostic imaging, patient measurement data, and clinical decision support. The current literature base is examined to identify areas where ML performs equal to or more accurately than human levels.\nPotential is apparent for intelligent machines to enhance various areas of physiotherapy practice through automization of tasks which involve data analysis, classification and prediction. Changes to service provision through applications of ML, should encourage physiotherapists to increase their awareness of and experiences with emerging technologies. Data literacy should be a component of professional development plans to assist physiotherapists in the application of ML and the preparation of information technology systems to use these techniques.", "This study presents the use of a machine learning method from the artificial intelligence area, such as the support vector machines, applied to the construction of data-based classification models for diagnosing undesired scenarios in the hydrogen production process by photo-fermentation, which was carried out by an immobilized photo-bacteria consortium. The diagnosis models were constructed with data obtained from simulations run with a mechanistic model of the process and assessed on both modelled and experimental batches. The results revealed a 100% diagnosis performance in those batches where light intensity was below and above an optimum operation range. Nevertheless, 55% diagnosis performance was obtained in modelled batches where pH was away from its optimum operation range, showing that diagnosis model predictions during the first observations of those batches were classified as normal operation and revealing diagnosis delay in pH oscillations. In general, results demonstrate the reliability of classification models to be used in future applications such as the on-line process monitoring to detect and diagnose undesired operating conditions and take corrective actions on time to maintain high hydrogen productivities.", "Over the past century, personality theory and research has successfully identified core sets of characteristics that consistently describe and explain fundamental differences in the way people think, feel and behave. Such characteristics were derived through theory, dictionary analyses, and survey research using explicit self-reports. The availability of social media data spanning millions of users now makes it possible to automatically derive characteristics from behavioral data-language use-at large scale. Taking advantage of linguistic information available through Facebook, we study the process of inferring a new set of potential human traits based on unprompted language use. We subject these new traits to a comprehensive set of evaluations and compare them with a popular five factor model of personality. We find that our language-based trait construct is often more generalizable in that it often predicts non-questionnaire-based outcomes better than questionnaire-based traits (e.g. entities someone likes, income and intelligence quotient), while the factors remain nearly as stable as traditional factors. Our approach suggests a value in new constructs of personality derived from everyday human language use.", "Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a form of neuronal dysplasia featuring high hereditary (up to 76%). This paper reviews recent progress made in genetic research on the cognitive function in ADHD. Two aspects of cognitive function were explored from the perspective of genetics, including intelligence and executive function.", "SDNET2018 is an annotated image dataset for training, validation, and benchmarking of artificial intelligence based crack detection algorithms for concrete. SDNET2018 contains over 56,000 images of cracked and non-cracked concrete bridge decks, walls, and pavements. The dataset includes cracks as narrow as 0.06\u202fmm and as wide as 25\u202fmm. The dataset also includes images with a variety of obstructions, including shadows, surface roughness, scaling, edges, holes, and background debris. SDNET2018 will be useful for the continued development of concrete crack detection algorithms based on deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs), which are a subject of continued research in the field of structural health monitoring. The authors present benchmark results for crack detection using SDNET2018 and a crack detection algorithm based on the AlexNet DCNN architecture. SDNET2018 is freely available at https://doi.org/10.15142/T3TD19.", "Levofloxacin is used for the treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis; however the optimal dose is unknown.\nWe used the hollow fiber system model of tuberculosis (HFS-TB) to identify 0-24 hour area under the concentration-time curve (AUC0-24) to minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) ratios associated with maximal microbial kill and suppression of acquired drug resistance (ADR) of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). Levofloxacin-resistant isolates underwent whole-genome sequencing. Ten thousands patient Monte Carlo experiments (MCEs) were used to identify doses best able to achieve the HFS-TB-derived target exposures in cavitary tuberculosis and tuberculous meningitis. Next, we used an ensemble of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to identify the most important predictors of sputum conversion, ADR, and death in Tanzanian patients with pulmonary multidrug-resistant tuberculosis treated with a levofloxacin-containing regimen. We also performed probit regression to identify optimal levofloxacin doses in Vietnamese tuberculous meningitis patients.\nIn the HFS-TB, the AUC0-24/MIC associated with maximal Mtb kill was 146, while that associated with suppression of resistance was 360. The most common gyrA mutations in resistant Mtb were Asp94Gly, Asp94Asn, and Asp94Tyr. The minimum dose to achieve target exposures in MCEs was 1500 mg/day. AI algorithms identified an AUC0-24/MIC of 160 as predictive of microbiologic cure, followed by levofloxacin 2-hour peak concentration and body weight. Probit regression identified an optimal dose of 25 mg/kg as associated with >90% favorable response in adults with pulmonary tuberculosis.\nThe levofloxacin dose of 25 mg/kg or 1500 mg/day was adequate for replacement of high-dose moxifloxacin in treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis.", "The ability for artificially reproducing human brain type signals' processing is one of the main challenges in modern information technology, being one of the milestones for developing global communicating networks and artificial intelligence. Electronic devices termed memristors have been proposed as effective artificial synapses able to emulate the plasticity of biological counterparts. Here we report for the first time a single crystalline nanowire based model system capable of combining all memristive functions - non-volatile bipolar memory, multilevel switching, selector and synaptic operations imitating Ca2+ dynamics of biological synapses. Besides underlying common electrochemical fundamentals of biological and artificial redox-based synapses, a detailed analysis of the memristive mechanism revealed the importance of surfaces and interfaces in crystalline materials. Our work demonstrates the realization of self-assembled, self-limited devices feasible for implementation via bottom up approach, as an attractive solution for the ultimate system miniaturization needed for the hardware realization of brain-inspired systems.", "The meta-analytic finding that faking does not affect the criterion validity of self-report measures in applicant selection suggests cognitive abilities are crucial to fake personality to an expected optimal profile in self-report measures. Previous studies in this field typically focus on how the extent of faking changes self-report measurement. However, the effect of faking ability is rarely considered. In Study 1 (n = 151), we link two questionnaires, the WSQ and the NEO-PI-R, to use them for later faking ability tasks. With O\u2217NET expert ratings and the linked questionnaires, we establish veridical responses of optimal personality profiles for both questionnaires. Based on this, in Study 2, we develop six faking ability task employing both questionnaires and three common jobs to fake for. To score the tasks, we introduce profile similarity metrics that compare faked response vectors to optimal profile vectors. The faking ability tasks were administered to a community sample (n = 210) who additionally completed measures of cognitive abilities, namely general mental ability, crystallized intelligence, and interpersonal abilities. For all, based on previous research, it can be argued that they should predict individual differences in faking ability. We establish a measurement model of faking ability and its relation to the other cognitive abilities. Using structural equations modeling, we find the strongest effect for crystallized intelligence and weaker effects for general mental ability and interpersonal abilities, all positively predicting faking ability. We show for the first time that we can measure faking ability with psychometrically sound techniques, establish a confirmatory factor model of faking ability and that it is largely explained by other cognitive abilities. We conclude that research supporting a positive link between self-reported personality and job performance is presumably confounded by cognitive abilities, because they are predictive of both faking self-reported personality and job performance. We recommend researchers to broaden their measurements with assessments of faking ability or other cognitive abilities (besides general mental ability) in research regarding applicant selection.", "Mental disorders account for around one-third of disability worldwide and cause enormous personal and societal burden. Current pharmacotherapies and nonpharmacotherapies do help many patients, but there are still high rates of partial or no response, delayed effect, and unfavorable adverse effects. The current diagnostic taxonomy of mental disorders by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders and the International Classification of Diseases relies on presenting signs and symptoms, but does not reflect evidence from neurobiological and behavioral systems. However, in the last decades, the understanding of biological mechanisms underlying mental disorders has grown and can be used for the development of precision medicine, that is, to deliver a patient-tailored individual treatment. Precision medicine may incorporate genetic variants contributing to the mental disorder and the response to pharmacotherapies, but also consider gene \u00a5 environment interactions, blood-based markers, neuropsychological tests, data from electronic health records, early life adversity, stressful life events, and very proximal factors such as lifestyle, nutrition, and sport. Methods such as artificial intelligence and the underlying machine learning and deep learning approaches provide the framework to stratify patients, initiate specific tailored treatments and thus increase response rates, reduce adverse effects and medical errors. In conclusion, precision medicine uses measurable health parameters to identify individuals at risk of a mental disorder, to improve the diagnostic process and to deliver a patient-tailored treatment.", "Cognitive performance is highly heritable. However, little is known about common genetic influences on cognitive ability and brain activation when engaged in a cognitive task. The Human Connectome Project (HCP) offers a unique opportunity to study this shared genetic etiology with an extended pedigree of 785 individuals. To investigate this common genetic origin, we took advantage of the HCP dataset, which includes both language and mathematics activation tasks. Using the HCP multimodal parcellation, we identified areals in which inter-individual functional MRI (fMRI) activation variance was significantly explained by genetics. Then, we performed bivariate genetic analyses between the neural activations and behavioral scores, corresponding to the fMRI task accuracies, fluid intelligence, working memory and language performance. We observed that several parts of the language network along the superior temporal sulcus, as well as the angular gyrus belonging to the math processing network, are significantly genetically correlated with these indicators of cognitive performance. This shared genetic etiology provides insights into the brain areas where the human-specific genetic repertoire is expressed. Studying the association of polygenic risk scores, using variants associated with human cognitive ability and brain activation, would provide an opportunity to better understand where these variants are influential.", "Objectives: This study aimed to explore changes in verbal comprehension subtest and index scores from Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, fourth edition (WISC)-IV to WISC-V for individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), as the test revision dropped the subtest that has proven to be most challenging for those with ASD (i.e. Comprehension). Methods: In all, 48 children with ASD who had been assessed with WISC-IV and re-evaluated with WISC-V were included in this study. Paired samples t-tests were used to examine changes in scores between administrations. Results: Results indicated that changes in subtest scores were minimal although a statistically significant index score change occurred. Discussion: These data suggest that administering additional measures of verbal intellect to individuals with ASD (i.e. beyond the two core verbal comprehension subtests of WISC-V) is critical for capturing the totality of their strengths and weaknesses, to effectively inform treatment planning.", "Emotional intelligence (EI) and mindfulness are two constructs that have been separately studied, and the relation between them still remains unclear. Research in this area has not attempted to go further into how enhancing EI and mindfulness together can achieve better improvements in this ability to attend mindfully. To bridge this knowledge gap, our research goal was to study the relationship between EI and the mindfulness competence in our study sample and to assess the impact of implementing EI and a mindfulness competence developmental program (SEA) about participants' mindfulness competence. The sample consisted of 156 students aged 11-14 years old from a Spanish public high school. One hundred and eight participants were randomly assigned to the experimental condition, and the remaining 48 were to the control condition. The instruments used to evaluate EI were the CDE-SEC, EQi-Youth Version and the General Empathy Scale. Mindfulness on the School Scope Scale was used to assess mindfulness competences. Social adaptation was evaluated by using the social abilities and adjustment questionnaire BAS3. All the instruments where answered by the participants and have been adapted to a sample of youths with such age specifications. The results showed that EI and mindfulness were related to many of the variables measured by the instruments. Showing a good mindfulness competence was particularly related to having a good general level of the EI trait, and to many of the assessed social and emotional variables. The data indicated a significant relation between the mindfulness competence and having better general empathy skills or being better socially adjusted to the school context. The data also indicated a significant effect on participants' interior and kinesthetic mindfulness competence after implementing the SEA Program. These findings corroborate the relationship between EI and mindfulness, and the possibility of enhancing mindfulness by applying a direct intervention program in the classroom.", "The phenomena of urbanization and climate change interact with the growing number of older people living in cities. One of the effects of climate change is an increased riverine flooding hazard, and when floods occur this has a severe impact on human lives and comes with vast economic losses. Flood resilience management procedures should be supported by a combination of complex social and environmental vulnerability assessments. Therefore, new methodologies and tools should be developed for this purpose. One way to achieve such inclusive procedures is by incorporating a social vulnerability evaluation methodology for environmental and flood resilience assessment. These are illustrated for application in the Polish city of Wroc\u0142aw. Socio-environmental vulnerability mapping, based on spatial analyses using the poverty risk index, data on the ageing population, as well as the distribution of the areas vulnerable to floods, was conducted with use of a location intelligence system combining Geographic Information System (GIS) and Business Intelligence (BI) tools. The new methodology allows for the identification of areas populated by social groups that are particularly vulnerable to the negative effects of flooding. Integr Environ Assess Manag 2018;14:592-597. \u00a9 2018 SETAC.", "The applications of modern artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms within the field of aging research offer tremendous opportunities. Aging is an almost universal unifying feature possessed by all living organisms, tissues, and cells. Modern deep learning techniques used to develop age predictors offer new possibilities for formerly incompatible dynamic and static data types. AI biomarkers of aging enable a holistic view of biological processes and allow for novel methods for building causal models-extracting the most important features and identifying biological targets and mechanisms. Recent developments in generative adversarial networks (GANs) and reinforcement learning (RL) permit the generation of diverse synthetic molecular and patient data, identification of novel biological targets, and generation of novel molecular compounds with desired properties and geroprotectors. These novel techniques can be combined into a unified, seamless end-to-end biomarker development, target identification, drug discovery and real world evidence pipeline that may help accelerate and improve pharmaceutical research and development practices. Modern AI is therefore expected to contribute to the credibility and prominence of longevity biotechnology in the healthcare and pharmaceutical industry, and to the convergence of countless areas of research.", "Cross-sectional case-control study.\nCompare psychosocial profile of magnetically-controlled growing rod (MCGR) patients to traditional-growing rod (TGR) with an array of psychiatric tools, expecting improvement in MCGR due to decreased number of surgical procedures.\nTGR treatment has had positive clinical and radiographic results; however, upward of 10 surgical sessions and high complication rates have called into question the quality of life of these children. Improvement with the introduction of the MCGR is expected.\nGR patients with minimum of 2-years follow-up were recruited. None had neurological conditions. All underwent testing with the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised, and only those in the normal range were included. Patients filled out questionnaires with mental health professionals to measure psychosocial status. MCGR patients' results were compared to TGR patients.\nTwenty-seven patients met criteria (10 MCGR, 17 TGR): average age at enrollment 11.8 years (range 5.9-17). MCGR group was significantly younger (9.1 vs. 13.3 yr) and had significantly shorter follow-up (45.6 vs. 82.8 mo) (P\u200a<\u200a0.05). TGR patients underwent an average of 16 surgical procedures, MCGR an average of 1.5 (including complications, P\u200a<\u200a0.05). Age at index surgery (6 yr), preoperative and postoperative major curve magnitudes (60\u00b0, 40\u00b0 respectively) were statistically similar.There was no difference in current psychiatric diagnoses between the groups. MCGR patients scored worse than TGR patients in general functionality domains. TGR patients showed increased functionality and prosocial scores with increased number of procedures. This effect was not observed in MCGR.\nThe expected improvement in psychosocial status with the MCGR was not observed at a 31.6-month-follow-up. It appears that provided the patient spends enough time in the treatment process to notice benefit and does not experience major complications, noninvasiveness of lengthening procedures does not show up as an advantage with the psychosocial tools utilized in this study.\n3.", "Mandatory policies have the potential to increase uptake of influenza ('flu') vaccination among healthcare workers (HCWs), but concerns have been expressed about their acceptability and effectiveness. We explored views on three mandatory policies (declination forms, face masks or reduced patient contact, and mandatory vaccination) among both HCWs and flu vaccination programme managers in the National Health Service (NHS) in England.\nA mixed method approach was employed. An online cross-sectional survey was conducted with staff responsible for implementing influenza campaigns in NHS trusts (healthcare organisations) in England (n\u202f=\u202f72 trusts). The survey measured perceived effectiveness of the three mandatory policies and perceived support for them among HCWs. Qualitative interviews were conducted in four trusts, with influenza campaign managers (n\u202f=\u202f24) and with HCWs who had the opportunity to receive the influenza vaccination (n\u202f=\u202f32). Interviews explored respondents' views of the three strategies and were analysed thematically using QSR NVivo 11 All data were collected shortly after the 2016/2017 influenza season.\nIn the survey, views varied on the effectiveness of the three policies and none of the interventions were thought to be strongly supported by HCWs, with particularly low levels of support perceived for mandatory vaccination and for face masks or reduced patient contact. The qualitative interviews revealed substantial concerns around the practicability and enforceability of mandatory policies and the potential discriminatory effect on HCWs who made a principled decision or had medical reasons for exemption. Additional doubts were also expressed regarding the effectiveness of face masks and their potential to worry patients, and the ethics of compelling staff to accept medical intervention.\nMandatory vaccination and face masks would not be strongly supported if introduced in the UK. If declination forms are adopted, they should be used in a constructive intelligence-gathering manner which avoids stigmatising HCWs.", "A positive relationship between brain volume and intelligence has been suspected since the 19th century, and empirical studies seem to support this hypothesis. However, this claim is controversial because of concerns about publication bias and the lack of systematic control for critical confounding factors (e.g., height, population structure). We conducted a preregistered study of the relationship between brain volume and cognitive performance using a new sample of adults from the United Kingdom that is about 70% larger than the combined samples of all previous investigations on this subject ( N = 13,608). Our analyses systematically controlled for sex, age, height, socioeconomic status, and population structure, and our analyses were free of publication bias. We found a robust association between total brain volume and fluid intelligence ( r = .19), which is consistent with previous findings in the literature after controlling for measurement quality of intelligence in our data. We also found a positive relationship between total brain volume and educational attainment ( r = .12). These relationships were mainly driven by gray matter (rather than white matter or fluid volume), and effect sizes were similar for both sexes and across age groups.", "The researches on postmortem interval \uff08PMI\uff09 estimation are very important and meaningful in forensic science.

Remarkable improvements in computational power coupled with advancements in AI technology could be utilised to revolutionise the drug development process. At present, the pharmaceutical industry is facing challenges in sustaining their drug development programmes because of increased R&D costs and reduced efficiency. In this review, we discuss the major causes of attrition rates in new drug approvals, the possible ways that AI can improve the efficiency of the drug development process and collaboration of pharmaceutical industry giants with AI-powered drug discovery firms.", "As optical networks undergo rapid development, the trade-offs among higher network service capability, and increasing operating expense (OPEX) about operations, administration and maintenance (OAM) become telecom operators' key obstacles. Intelligent and automatic OAM is considered to effectively satisfy service requirements, while dampening OPEX growth. In particular, machine learning (ML) has been investigated as a possible method of replacing human image recognition, nature language processing, automatic drive, and so forth. This is because of its essential feature extraction ability. ML application in optical networks was studied in a preliminary way recently. In ML-enabled optical networks, huge data storage and powerful computing resources are required to handle computer-intensive tasks performed in order to analyze features from big data sets. Integration of these two key resources into existing optical network architectures, in order to improve network performance, is an emerging challenge for ML-enabled optical networks. This article proposes a novel optical network architecture, which is based on software-defined networking (SDN), which is also named self-optimizing optical networks (SOON). First, we comb through intelligence development of optical networks, and introduce SOON as an OAM-oriented optical network architecture. Second, we demonstrate four typical applications within SOON, including tidal traffic prediction, alarm prediction, anomaly action detection, and routing and wavelength assignment. Finally, we discuss some open issues.", "The DNA sequencing technology invented in 1970's has been a leading tool for genomics and its sequel \u2500 precision medicine. The needs for advancement of the DNA sequencing technology comes from increasing resolutions in cellular and molecular studies, not only DNA or cDNA sequences but also their covalent modifications, such as various kinds of DNA or RNA methylations. Sequencing single RNA molecules directly without conversion into cDNAs appears to be the last generation of nucleotide sequencers. Some cutting-edge technological elements are clearly expected for the ultimate design of nucleotide sequencers, which must include, but not limited to, nanopores, nanofabrication, surface- or tip-enhanced Raman spectrometry, single-molecule photonics and plasmonics, artificial-intelligence based data analysis tools. The complexity of biological systems is also calling for new syntheses, frameworks, paradigms and more concerted efforts and projects internationally. Here we discuss possible roles and capacities of such technical elements for the fourth-generation nucleotide sequencers in details.", "Detectable post-therapy plasma Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA predicts poor survival in non-metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). However, some patients subsequently experience spontaneous remission of residual EBV DNA during follow-up and it was unclear whether these patients were still at high risk of disease failure. Using the NPC database from an established big-data intelligence platform, 3269 NPC patients who had the plasma EBV DNA load measured at the end of therapy (\u00b1 1 week) were identified. In total, 93.0% (3031/3269) and 7.0% (238/3269) of patients had undetectable and detectable (> 0 copy/ml) plasma EBV DNA at the end of therapy (EBV DNAend ), respectively. Detectable EBV DNAend was a prognostic factor for poorer 3-year disease-free survival (DFS), overall survival (OS), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS), and loco-regional recurrence-free survival (LRRFS) in both univariate and multivariate analyses. Of 238 patients with residual EBV DNAend , 192 underwent EBV DNA assay 3 months after and spontaneous remission occurred in 72.4% (139/192). However, these patients still had poorer 3-year DFS (55.1% vs. 89.8%), OS (79.1% vs. 96.2%), DMFS (68.4% vs. 94.1%) and LRRFS (84.5% vs. 95.0%) than patients with undetectable EBV DNAend (all p < 0.001). And patients with persistent detectable post-therapy EBV DNA had the worst outcomes. These results were confirmed in multivariate analysis. In conclusion, residual EBV DNA post therapy was a robust biomarker for NPC prognosis. Although residual post-therapy EBV DNA could spontaneous remit during follow-up, these patients were still at high risk of disease failure and such patients may benefit from adjuvant therapy.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing our world, with applications ranging from medicine to engineering.\nHere we discuss the promise, challenges, and probable data sources needed to apply AI in the fields of exposure science and environmental health. In particular, we focus on the use of deep convolutional neural networks to estimate environmental exposures using images and other complementary data sources such as cell phone mobility and social media information.\nCharacterizing the health impacts of multiple spatially-correlated exposures remains a challenge in environmental epidemiology. A shift toward integrated measures that simultaneously capture multiple aspects of the urban built environment could improve efficiency and provide important insights into how our collective environments influence population health. The widespread adoption of AI in exposure science is on the frontier. This will likely result in new ways of understanding environmental impacts on health and may allow for analyses to be efficiently scaled for broad coverage. Image-based convolutional neural networks may also offer a cost-effective means of estimating local environmental exposures in low and middle-income countries where monitoring and surveillance infrastructure is limited. However, suitable databases must first be assembled to train and evaluate these models and these novel approaches should be complemented with traditional exposure metrics.\nThe promise of deep learning in environmental health is great and will complement existing measurements for data-rich settings and could enhance the resolution and accuracy of estimates in data poor scenarios. Interdisciplinary partnerships will be needed to fully realize this potential.", "Higher emotional Intelligence (EI) is linked to improved doctor-patient relationships, empathy, teamwork, communication skills, stress management, and leadership in medicine. This study analyzes the effects of age, postgraduate year (PGY), gender, and prior military experience on EI in military general surgery residents, and compares these to the general population and civilian surgery residents.\nThis is a retrospective, observational study. Results were analyzed using independent sample t test and linear regression to compare general surgery residents with the normative population and civilian general surgery residents.\nThe general surgery department at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, a single-center, academic institution.\nAll general surgery residents, PGY 1 to 6, were surveyed at the beginning of academic year, in June 2016.\nThere were no statistically discernable differences in global EI between male (n\u202f=\u202f27) and female residents (n\u202f=\u202f19), PGY, or prior military experience. Female general surgery residents show higher global EI, and both males and females scored higher in the self-control factor than the normative population. Mid-residency, there is a nonstatistically discernible dip in many factors and facets of EI.\nGender differences in EI present in the general population were not appreciated in our cohort of surgery residents, which confirms the results of previous studies. This may be due to the fact that general surgery residents are a more uniform group than the population at large. Additionally, our cohort of military surgery residents demonstrated similar global EI to civilian surgery residents. While PGY had no statistically discernable affect on global, facet, or factor EI, more studies are needed to longitudinally follow changes in EI over the course of surgery residency.", "Background: Suicide has been considered an important public health issue for years and is one of the main causes of death worldwide. Despite prevention strategies being applied, the rate of suicide has not changed substantially over the past decades. Suicide risk has proven extremely difficult to assess for medical specialists, and traditional methodologies deployed have been ineffective. Advances in machine learning make it possible to attempt to predict suicide with the analysis of relevant data aiming to inform clinical practice. Aims: We aimed to (a) test our artificial intelligence based, referral-centric methodology in the context of the National Health Service (NHS), (b) determine whether statistically relevant results can be derived from data related to previous suicides, and (c) develop ideas for various exploitation strategies. Method: The analysis used data of patients who died by suicide in the period 2013-2016 including both structured data and free-text medical notes, necessitating the deployment of state-of-the-art machine learning and text mining methods. Limitations: Sample size is a limiting factor for this study, along with the absence of non-suicide cases. Specific analytical solutions were adopted for addressing both issues. Results and Conclusion: The results of this pilot study indicate that machine learning shows promise for predicting within a specified period which people are most at risk of taking their own life at the time of referral to a mental health service.", "The rapid development of information technology and data processing capabilities has led to the creation of new tools known as artificial intelligence (AI). Medical applications of AI are emerging, and the French radiology community felt it was therefore timely to issue a position paper on AI as part of its role as a leader in the development of digital projects. Essential information about the application of AI to radiology includes a description of the available algorithms with a glossary; a review of the issues raised by healthcare data, notably those pertaining to imaging (imaging data and co-variables, metadata); a look at research and innovation; an overview of current and future applications; a discussion of AI education; and a scrutiny of ethical issues. In addition to the principles set forth at the Asilomar Conference on Beneficial AI, the French radiology community has developed ten principles aimed at governing the use and development of AI tools in a manner that will create a concerted approach centered on benefits to patients, while also ensuring good integration within clinical workflows. High-quality care in radiology and opportunities for managing large datasets are two avenues relevant to the development of a precision, personalized, and participative radiology practice characterized by improved predictive and preventive capabilities.", "A growing body of research has linked personality traits to cognitive performance. This relationship might play a role in the predisposition toward obesity. Neuroticism and executive function seem to be particularly involved, and reduced executive function has been proposed to underlie the association of neuroticism with sedentary behaviors and fatty food consumption. Despite the link between neuroticism, cognitive functions and obesity has been largely reported, conflicting evidence exists. Moreover, information regarding other cognitive domains, and studies on overweight individuals, are still scarce.\nWe examined cross-sectional associations of neuroticism and cognitive function with overweight and obesity in a sample of 170 310 individuals from the UK Biobank cohort, adjusted for sociodemographic and life-style factors. Measures on fluid intelligence (FI) (reasoning ability), trail making test (TMT) (executive function), numeric memory test and pairs matching (PM) task (short-term memory) were extracted from the database. Correlations between neuroticism and cognitive performance were explored. Moreover, we investigated whether neuroticism and executive function could predict BMI variability over time.\nReduced FI and short-term memory were associated with overweight and obesity, while reduced executive function was associated with obesity but not with overweight. Low neuroticism was associated with being overweight rather than lean or obese independently of gender and life-style. Furthermore, baseline neuroticism scores could predict BMI variations over 5-10 years follow-up, and high neuroticism correlated with lower cognitive performance.\nLower cognitive performance is associated with both overweight and obesity, except for executive function, which was only related to obesity. Neuroticism correlated with performance on most of the cognitive domains tested, supporting the link between personality and cognition. Our findings also support the role of neuroticism in leading to greater weight variability over time, rather than to overweight/obesity itself.", "Medical students and healthcare professionals can benefit from exposure to cross-disciplinary teamwork and core concepts of medical innovation. Indeed, to address complex challenges in patient care, diversity in collaboration across medicine, engineering, business, and design is critical. However, a limited number of academic institutions have established cross-disciplinary opportunities for students and young professionals within these domains to work collaboratively towards diverse healthcare needs.\nDrawing upon best practices from computer science and engineering, healthcare hackathons bring together interdisciplinary teams of students and professionals to collaborate, brainstorm, and build solutions to unmet clinical needs. Over the course of six months, a committee of 20 undergraduates, medical students, and physician advisors organized Stanford University's first healthcare hackathon (November 2016). Demographic data from initial applications were supplemented with responses from a post-hackathon survey gauging themes of diversity in collaboration, professional development, interest in medical innovation, and educational value. In designing and evaluating the event, the committee focused on measurable outcomes of diversity across participants (skillset, age, gender, academic degree), ideas (clinical needs), and innovations (projects).\nDemographic data (n\u2009=\u2009587 applicants, n\u2009=\u2009257 participants) reveal participants across diverse academic backgrounds, age groups, and domains of expertise were in attendance. From 50 clinical needs presented representing 19 academic fields, 40 teams ultimately formed and submitted projects spanning web (n\u2009=\u200913) and mobile applications (n\u2009=\u200913), artificial intelligence-based tools (n\u2009=\u20096), and medical devices (n\u2009=\u20093), among others. In post-hackathon survey responses (n\u2009=\u2009111), medical students and healthcare professionals alike noted a positive impact on their ability to work in multidisciplinary teams, learn from individuals of different backgrounds, and address complex healthcare challenges.\nHealthcare hackathons can encourage diversity across individuals, ideas, and projects to address clinical challenges. By providing an outline of Stanford's inaugural event, we hope more universities can adopt the healthcare hackathon model to promote diversity in collaboration in medicine.", "This study was to identify whether working memory (WM) can be clearly subdivided according to auditory and visual modality. To do this, we administered the most recent and universal clinical WM measures in a mixed psychiatric sample.\nA total of 115 patients were diagnosed on the basis of DSM-IV diagnostic criteria and with MINI-Plus 5.0, a structured diagnostic interview. WM subtests of Korean version of Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-IV and Korean version of Wechsler Memory Scale-IV were administered to assess WM. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was used to observe whether WM measures fit better to a one-factor or two-factor model.\nCFA results demonstrated that a two factor model fits the data better than one-factor model as expected.\nOur study supports a modality model of WM, or the existence of modality-specific WM systems, and thus poses a clinical significance of assessing both auditory and visual WM tests.", "Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are one type of artificial intelligence. Here, we use an ANN-based machine learning algorithm to automatically predict visual outcomes after ranibizumab treatment in diabetic macular edema.\nPatient data were used to optimize ANNs for regression calculation. The target was established as the final visual acuity at 52, 78, or 104 weeks. The input baseline variables were sex, age, diabetes type or condition, systemic diseases, eye status and treatment time tables. Three groups were randomly devised to build, test and demonstrate the accuracy of the algorithms.\nAt 52, 78 and 104 weeks, 512, 483 and 464 eyes were included, respectively. For the training group, testing group and validation group, the respective correlation coefficients were 0.75, 0.77 and 0.70 (52 weeks); 0.79, 0.80 and 0.55 (78 weeks); and 0.83, 0.47 and 0.81 (104 weeks), while the mean standard errors of final visual acuity were 6.50, 6.11 and 6.40 (52 weeks); 5.91, 5.83 and 7.59; (78 weeks); and 5.39, 8.70 and 6.81 (104 weeks).\nMachine learning had good correlation coefficients for predicating prognosis with ranibizumab with just baseline characteristics. These models could be the useful clinical tools for prediction of success of the treatments.", "The validity of studies investigating interventions to enhance fluid intelligence (Gf) depends on the adequacy of the Gf measures administered. Such studies have yielded mixed results, with a suggestion that Gf measurement issues may be partly responsible. The purpose of this study was to develop a Gf test battery comprising tests meeting the following criteria: (a) strong construct validity evidence, based on prior research; (b) reliable and sensitive to change; (c) varying in item types and content; (d) producing parallel tests, so that pretest-posttest comparisons could be made; (e) appropriate time limits; (f) unidimensional, to facilitate interpretation; and (g) appropriate in difficulty for a high-ability population, to detect change. A battery comprising letter, number, and figure series and figural matrix item types was developed and evaluated in three large-N studies (N = 3,067, 2,511, and 801, respectively). Items were generated algorithmically on the basis of proven item models from the literature, to achieve high reliability at the targeted difficulty levels. An item response theory approach was used to calibrate the items in the first two studies and to establish conditional reliability targets for the tests and the battery. On the basis of those calibrations, fixed parallel forms were assembled for the third study, using linear programming methods. Analyses showed that the tests and test battery achieved the proposed criteria. We suggest that the battery as constructed is a promising tool for measuring the effectiveness of cognitive enhancement interventions, and that its algorithmic item construction enables tailoring the battery to different difficulty targets, for even wider applications.", "Chronic musculoskeletal neck and back pain are disabling conditions among adults. Use of technology has been suggested as an alternative way to increase adherence to exercise therapy, which may improve clinical outcomes.\nThe aim was to investigate the self-perceived benefits of an artificial intelligence (AI)-embedded mobile app to self-manage chronic neck and back pain.\nA total of 161 participants responded to the invitation. The evaluation questionnaire included 14 questions that were intended to explore if using the AI rehabilitation system may (1) increase time spent on therapeutic exercise, (2) affect pain level (assessed by the 0-10 Numerical Pain Rating Scale), and (3) reduce the need for other interventions.\nAn increase in time spent on therapeutic exercise per day was observed. The median Numerical Pain Rating Scale scores were 6 (interquartile range [IQR] 5-8) before and 4 (IQR 3-6) after using the AI-embedded mobile app (95% CI 1.18-1.81). A 3-point reduction was reported by the participants who used the AI-embedded mobile app for more than 6 months. Reduction in the usage of other interventions while using the AI-embedded mobile app was also reported.\nThis study demonstrated the positive self-perceived beneficiary effect of using the AI-embedded mobile app to provide a personalized therapeutic exercise program. The positive results suggest that it at least warrants further study to investigate the physiological effect of the AI-embedded mobile app and how it compares with routine clinical care.", "Introduction: Artificial intelligence systems based on neural networks (NNs) find rules for drug discovery according to training molecules, but first, the molecules need to be represented in certain ways. Molecular descriptors and fingerprints have been used as inputs for artificial neural networks (ANNs) for a long time, while other ways for describing molecules are used only for storing and presenting molecules. With the development of deep learning, variants of ANNs are now able to use different kinds of inputs, which provide researchers with more choices for drug discovery. Areas covered: The authors provide a brief overview of the applications of NNs in drug discovery. Combined with the characteristics of different ways for describing molecules, corresponding methods based on NNs provide new choices for drug discovery, including de novo drug design, ligand-based drug design, and receptor-based drug design. Expert opinion: Various ways for describing molecules can be inputs of NN-based models, and these models achieve satisfactory results in metrics. Although most of the models have not been widely applied and tested in practice, they can be the basis for automatic drug discovery in the future.", "Patients with schizophrenia not only have impairments in neurological function, but also have instability and variability in neurocognitive function. However, previous researchers have not fully studied the relationships between dispersion across multiple neurocognitive domains and white matter (WM) structures of the brain. This study focuses on intra-individual variability (IIV) in patients with schizophrenia and its relationship with WM integrity of the corpus callosum (CC). Thirty-eight patients with schizophrenia were enrolled in the study. All subjects underwent assessments of neurocognitive function using the Korean-Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised (K-WAIS-R) and the severity of clinical symptoms using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). IIV across subtests of the K-WAIS-R was calculated using the Holtzer's equation. Tract-based spatial statistics were used to analyze diffusion tensor images. In subjects with schizophrenia, a negative correlation was found between IIV in performance intelligence quotient (PIQ) and fractional anisotropy (FA) values in the genu of the CC. In addition, FA values of the same region were negatively correlated with the total and subscale scores of positive symptoms and general psychopathology from the PANSS. Our findings suggest that the genu of the CC may play an important role in IIV in PIQ and symptomatology in patients with schizophrenia.", "Background: Oncologists increasingly rely on clinical genome sequencing to pursue effective, molecularly targeted therapies. This study assesses the validity and utility of the artificial intelligence Watson for Genomics (WfG) for analyzing clinical sequencing results. Methods: This study identified patients with solid tumors who participated in in-house genome sequencing projects at a single cancer specialty hospital between April 2013 and October 2016. Targeted genome sequencing results of these patients' tumors, previously analyzed by multidisciplinary specialists at the hospital, were reanalyzed by WfG. This study measures the concordance between the two evaluations. Results: In 198 patients, in-house genome sequencing detected 785 gene mutations, 40 amplifications, and 22 fusions after eliminating single nucleotide polymorphisms. Breast cancer (n = 40) was the most frequent diagnosis in this analysis, followed by gastric cancer (n = 31), and lung cancer (n = 30). Frequently detected single nucleotide variants were found in TP53 (n = 107), BRCA2 (n = 24), and NOTCH2 (n = 23). MYC (n = 10) was the most frequently detected gene amplification, followed by ERBB2 (n = 9) and CCND1 (n = 6). Concordant pathogenic classifications (i.e., pathogenic, benign, or variant of unknown significance) between in-house specialists and WfG included 705 mutations (89.8%; 95% CI, 87.5%-91.8%), 39 amplifications (97.5%; 95% CI, 86.8-99.9%), and 17 fusions (77.3%; 95% CI, 54.6-92.2%). After about 12 months, reanalysis using a more recent version of WfG demonstrated a better concordance rate of 94.5% (95% CI, 92.7-96.0%) for gene mutations. Across the 249 gene alterations determined to be pathogenic by both methods, including mutations, amplifications, and fusions, WfG covered 84.6% (88 of 104) of all targeted therapies that experts proposed and offered an additional 225 therapeutic options. Conclusions: WfG was able to scour large volumes of data from scientific studies and databases to analyze in-house clinical genome sequencing results and demonstrated the potential for application to clinical practice; however, we must train WfG in clinical trial settings.", "Background: Deficits in social cognition are well-recognized in both schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorders (ASD). However, it is less clear how social cognition deficits differ between both disorders and what distinct mechanisms may underlie such differences. We aimed at reviewing available evidence from studies directly comparing social cognitive performance between individuals with schizophrenia and ASD. Methods: We performed a systematic review of literature up to May 22, 2018 on Pubmed, Web of Science, and Scopus. Search terms included combinations of the keywords \"social cognition,\" \"theory of mind,\" \"autism,\" \"Asperger,\" \"psychosis,\" and \"schizophrenia.\" Two researchers independently selected and extracted data according to PRISMA guidelines. Random-effects meta-analyses were conducted for performance on social cognitive tasks evaluating: (1) emotion perception; (2) theory of mind (ToM); (3) emotional intelligence (managing emotions score of the Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test); and (4) social skills. Results: We identified 19 eligible studies for meta-analysis including a total of 1,040 patients (558 with schizophrenia and 482 with ASD). Eight studies provided data on facial emotion perception that evidenced a better performance by participants with schizophrenia compared to those with ASD (Hedges' g = 0.43; p = 0.031). No significant differences were found between groups in the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (8 studies; Hedges' g = 0.22; p = 0.351), other ToM tasks (9 studies; Hedges' g = -0.03; p = 0.903), emotional intelligence (3 studies; Hedges' g = -0.17; p = 0.490), and social skills (3 studies; Hedges' g = 0.86; p = 0.056). Participants' age was a significant moderator of effect size in emotion perception and RMET analyzes, with larger differences favoring patients with schizophrenia being observed in studies with younger participants. Conclusions: The instruments that are currently available to evaluate social cognition poorly differentiate between individuals with schizophrenia and ASD. Combining behavioral tasks with neurophysiologic assessments may better characterize the differences in social cognition between both disorders.", "Like other scientific fields, such as cosmology, high-energy physics, or even the life sciences, medicine and healthcare face the challenge of an extremely quick transformation into data-driven sciences. This challenge entails the daunting task of extracting usable knowledge from these data using algorithmic methods. In the medical context this may for instance realized through the design of medical decision support systems for diagnosis, prognosis and patient management. The intensive care unit (ICU), and by extension the whole area of critical care, is becoming one of the most data-driven clinical environments.\nThe increasing availability of complex and heterogeneous data at the point of patient attention in critical care environments makes the development of fresh approaches to data analysis almost compulsory. Computational Intelligence (CI) and Machine Learning (ML) methods can provide such approaches and have already shown their usefulness in addressing problems in this context. The current study has a dual goal: it is first a review of the state-of-the-art on the use and application of such methods in the field of critical care. Such review is presented from the viewpoint of the different subfields of critical care, but also from the viewpoint of the different available ML and CI techniques. The second goal is presenting a collection of results that illustrate the breath of possibilities opened by ML and CI methods using a single problem, the investigation of septic shock at the ICU.\nWe have presented a structured state-of-the-art that illustrates the broad-ranging ways in which ML and CI methods can make a difference in problems affecting the manifold areas of critical care. The potential of ML and CI has been illustrated in detail through an example concerning the sepsis pathology. The new definitions of sepsis and the relevance of using the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) in its diagnosis have been considered. Conditional independence models have been used to address this problem, showing that SIRS depends on both organ dysfunction measured through the Sequential Organ Failure (SOFA) score and the ICU outcome, thus concluding that SIRS should still be considered in the study of the pathophysiology of Sepsis. Current assessment of the risk of dead at the ICU lacks specificity. ML and CI techniques are shown to improve the assessment using both indicators already in place and other clinical variables that are routinely measured. Kernel methods in particular are shown to provide the best performance balance while being amenable to representation through graphical models, which increases their interpretability and, with it, their likelihood to be accepted in medical practice.", "An incremental (growth) theory of intelligence (mindset), compared with an entity (fixed) mindset, has been associated with improved motivation and performance. Interventions to induce incremental beliefs have improved performance on non-surgical motor tasks. We sought to evaluate the impact of 2 brief interventions to induce incremental beliefs in the context of learning a surgical task.\nTwo randomized experiments.\nSecondary school students participating in medical simulation-based training activities at an academic medical center.\nWe created 4 instructional messages intended to influence mindsets (two 60-second videos in Study 1, 2 fabricated \"journal articles\" in Study 2). In each study, one message emphasized that ability improves with practice (incremental); the other emphasized that ability is fixed (entity). After reviewing their randomly-assigned message, participants completed a laparoscopic cutting task as many times as they desired. Measurements included performance (product quality, self-reported task, and completion time), task persistence (repetitions), and entity beliefs.\nTwo hundred and three students completed Study 1. Postevent entity beliefs (1\u202f=\u202flowest, 6\u202f=\u202fhighest) were similar between groups (incremental, 2.0vs entity, 2.0; p\u202f=\u202f0.78). Contrary to hypothesis, the incremental video group demonstrated slower time (276vs 191 seconds; p < 0.0001), lower product quality (7.2vs 3.8mm deviation; p < 0.0001), and fewer task repetitions (1.4vs 1.8; p\u202f=\u202f0.02). In Study 2, 113 participants provided outcomes related to mindset beliefs, but only 14 provided usable performance outcomes. Postevent entity beliefs were lower in the incremental article group (1.7vs 2.4; p < 0.0001). Task time (507vs 585 seconds; p\u202f=\u202f0.40) and quality (7.1vs 7.5mm deviation; p\u202f=\u202f0.85) were similar between groups.\nBrief motivational interventions can influence procedural performance and motivation. We need to better understand motivation and other affective influences on procedural skills learning. Mindset theory shows promise in this regard.", "Interpretation of intelligence tests has changed over time, from a focus on the elevation of general ability in the early 1900s, to the shape and/or scatter of subtest and index scores in the mid-1900s to the early 2000s, and back to elevation today. The primary emphasis of interpretation now, however, is widely recommended to be on normative strengths and weaknesses of scores reflecting broad and narrow abilities in the Cattell-Horn-Carroll (CHC) theory (Schneider & McGrew, 2012). Decisions about which abilities are important to assess for the diagnosis of learning difficulties are based largely on literature reviews by Flanagan, Ortiz, Alfonso, and Mascolo (2006) and McGrew and Wendling (2010). These were narrative research syntheses, however, and did not attempt to estimate the magnitude of the relations between CHC abilities and academic achievement. The purpose of this study, therefore, was to conduct a meta-analysis to determine the effect size for these relations across age groups. Results of our analyses found that psychometric g and one or more broad cognitive abilities are substantially related to each area of academic achievement. Across all achievement domains and ages, g had by far the largest effect, with a mean effect size of r2\u202f=\u202f0.540. In fact, psychometric g explained more variance in academic outcomes than all broad abilities combined. Most broad abilities explained less than 10% of the variance in achievement and none explained more than 20%. Some age-related changes in cognitive ability-achievement relations were also observed. In sum, results of our meta-analysis support the interpretation of the overall score on intelligence tests as a measure of psychometric g for diagnosing difficulties in reading and mathematics, but only the interpretation of index scores measuring Comprehension-Knowledge (Gc) when diagnosing difficulties in reading. Implications of these results for research and practice are discussed.", "Clinical success of immunotherapy is driving the need for new prognostic and predictive assays to inform patient selection and stratification. This requirement can be met by a combination of computational pathology and artificial intelligence. Here, we critically assess computational approaches supporting the development of a standardized methodology in the assessment of immune-oncology biomarkers, such as PD-L1 and immune cell infiltrates. We examine immunoprofiling through spatial analysis of tumor-immune cell interactions and multiplexing technologies as a predictor of patient response to cancer treatment. Further, we discuss how integrated bioinformatics can enable the amalgamation of complex morphological phenotypes with the multiomics datasets that drive precision medicine. We provide an outline to machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence tools and illustrate fields of application in immune-oncology, such as pattern-recognition in large and complex datasets and deep learning approaches for survival analysis. Synergies of surgical pathology and computational analyses are expected to improve patient stratification in immuno-oncology. We propose that future clinical demands will be best met by (1) dedicated research at the interface of pathology and bioinformatics, supported by professional societies, and (2) the integration of data sciences and digital image analysis in the professional education of pathologists.", "Restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs) and their extensions, often called \"deep-belief networks\", are powerful neural networks that have found applications in the fields of machine learning and artificial intelligence. The standard way to train these models resorts to an iterative unsupervised procedure based on Gibbs sampling, called \"contrastive divergence\", and additional supervised tuning via back-propagation. However, this procedure has been shown not to follow any gradient and can lead to suboptimal solutions. In this paper, we show an efficient alternative to contrastive divergence by means of simulations of digital memcomputing machines (DMMs) that compute the gradient of the log-likelihood involved in unsupervised training. We test our approach on pattern recognition using a modified version of the MNIST data set of hand-written numbers. DMMs sample effectively the vast phase space defined by the probability distribution of RBMs, and provide a good approximation close to the optimum. This efficient search significantly reduces the number of generative pretraining iterations necessary to achieve a given level of accuracy in the MNIST data set, as well as a total performance gain over the traditional approaches. In fact, the acceleration of the pretraining achieved by simulating DMMs is comparable to, in number of iterations, the recently reported hardware application of the quantum annealing method on the same network and data set. Notably, however, DMMs perform far better than the reported quantum annealing results in terms of quality of the training. Finally, we also compare our method to recent advances in supervised training, like batch-normalization and rectifiers, that seem to reduce the advantage of pretraining. We find that the memcomputing method still maintains a quality advantage (>1% in accuracy, corresponding to a 20% reduction in error rate) over these approaches, despite the network pretrained with memcomputing defines a more non-convex landscape using sigmoidal activation functions without batch-normalization. Our approach is agnostic about the connectivity of the network. Therefore, it can be extended to train full Boltzmann machines, and even deep networks at once.", "Radiology images are an essential part of clinical decision making and population screening, e.g., for cancer. Automated systems could help clinicians cope with large amounts of images by answering questions about the image contents. An emerging area of artificial intelligence, Visual Question Answering (VQA) in the medical domain explores approaches to this form of clinical decision support. Success of such machine learning tools hinges on availability and design of collections composed of medical images augmented with question-answer pairs directed at the content of the image. We introduce VQA-RAD, the first manually constructed dataset where clinicians asked naturally occurring questions about radiology images and provided reference answers. Manual categorization of images and questions provides insight into clinically relevant tasks and the natural language to phrase them. Evaluating with well-known algorithms, we demonstrate the rich quality of this dataset over other automatically constructed ones. We propose VQA-RAD to encourage the community to design VQA tools with the goals of improving patient care.", "Biological aging pathways accelerated by cancer treatments may be a mechanism for cognitive impairment in cancer survivors. The goal of the current study was to examine whether indicators of biological aging, namely elevated levels of DNA damage, reduced telomerase enzymatic activity, and shorter peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) telomere length (TL) would be related to cognitive function in a cohort of survivors of breast cancer.\nThe authors evaluated a cross-sectional sample of 94 women aged 36 to 69 years who were treated for early-stage breast cancer 3 to 6 years previously. Leukocyte DNA damage, PBMC telomerase enzymatic activity, PBMC TL, and the inflammatory marker soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor II (sTNF-RII) were determined from blood samples. Cognitive function was assessed using a neuropsychological test battery and self-report. Linear regression models examined the relationship between biological aging predictors and cognitive outcomes.\nBoth higher DNA damage and lower telomerase were found to be statistically significantly related to lower executive function scores adjusting for age, body mass index, race, years from treatment, and intelligence score (standardized coefficients [B], -0.23 and 0.30; all P values <.05). In addition, lower telomerase activity was associated with worse attention and motor speed scores (B values, 0.30 and 0.24; P &lt;.05). sTNF-RII and TL were found to be unrelated to any of the neurocognitive domains.\nThe results of the current study suggest a significant association between measures of biological aging and objective measures of cognitive performance in survivors of breast cancer. Future prospective studies are needed to confirm a causal role of biological aging as a driver of declines in cognitive function after cancer treatment.", "Patients with schizophrenia show various trajectories in intelligence. However, whether the degree of IQ decline is associated with functional outcomes remains unclear. The purposes of the study were 1) to determine whether IQ decline was related with work outcome, and 2) to perform predictions for attaining a certain amount of work measured by work hours.\nOne hundred and forty patients with schizophrenia and 156 healthy volunteers enrolled in the study. The patients were classified into the deteriorated group or preserved group based on the degree of IQ decline. In addition to current and premorbid intelligence, functional outcomes and clinical conditions were also evaluated. Those variables were compared among the patient groups and healthy adults to select independent variables for logistic regression analyses. Four separate logistic regression analyses were conducted with work hours dichotomized by four criteria (0, 10, 20, or 30\u202fh per week) as dependent variables.\nIQ decline remained significant in all regression models except the model with the 30\u202fh per week criterion. Social function and psychiatric symptoms were also prominent factors in most models. Predictions were more accurate in the models with higher criteria. Individual probabilities to exceed each criterion were presented based on the equations derived from the regression models.\nIntellectual deterioration, in addition to impaired social function and psychiatric symptoms, may play a key role in work disturbances in patients with schizophrenia. Probability models presented here have strengths in evaluating the ability to work from statistical, clinical, and theoretical viewpoints.", "Chronic opioid exposure is common world-wide, but behavioural performance remains under-investigated. This study aimed to investigate visuospatial memory performance in opioid-exposed and dependent clinical populations and its associations with measures of intelligence and cognitive impulsivity.\nWe recruited 109 participants: (i) patients with a history of opioid dependence due to chronic heroin use (n = 24), (ii) heroin users stabilised on methadone maintenance treatment (n = 29), (iii) participants with a history of chronic pain and prescribed tramadol and codeine (n = 28) and (iv) healthy controls (n = 28). The neuropsychological tasks from the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery included the Delayed Matching to Sample (DMS), Pattern Recognition Memory, Spatial Recognition Memory, Paired Associate Learning, Spatial Span Task, Spatial Working Memory and Cambridge Gambling Task. Pre-morbid general intelligence was assessed using the National Adult Reading Test.\nAs hypothesised, this study identified the differential effects of chronic heroin and methadone exposures on neuropsychological measures of visuospatial memory (p &lt; 0.01) that were independent of injecting behaviour and dependence status. The study also identified an improvement in DMS performance (specifically at longer delays) when the methadone group was compared with the heroin group and also when the heroin group was stabilised onto methadone. Results identified differential effects of chronic heroin and methadone exposures on various neuropsychological measures of visuospatial memory independently from addiction severity measures, such as injecting behaviour and dependence status.", "Purpose The Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) Pediatric Bone Age Machine Learning Challenge was created to show an application of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) in medical imaging, promote collaboration to catalyze AI model creation, and identify innovators in medical imaging. Materials and Methods The goal of this challenge was to solicit individuals and teams to create an algorithm or model using ML techniques that would accurately determine skeletal age in a curated data set of pediatric hand radiographs. The primary evaluation measure was the mean absolute distance (MAD) in months, which was calculated as the mean of the absolute values of the difference between the model estimates and those of the reference standard, bone age. Results A data set consisting of 14 236 hand radiographs (12 611 training set, 1425 validation set, 200 test set) was made available to registered challenge participants. A total of 260 individuals or teams registered on the Challenge website. A total of 105 submissions were uploaded from 48 unique users during the training, validation, and test phases. Almost all methods used deep neural network techniques based on one or more convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The best five results based on MAD were 4.2, 4.4, 4.4, 4.5, and 4.5 months, respectively. Conclusion The RSNA Pediatric Bone Age Machine Learning Challenge showed how a coordinated approach to solving a medical imaging problem can be successfully conducted. Future ML challenges will catalyze collaboration and development of ML tools and methods that can potentially improve diagnostic accuracy and patient care. \u00a9 RSNA, 2018 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

Latent class analysis identified two mutually exclusive health behavior groups, which according to response patterns were labeled as Healthy and Unhealthy. The Healthy group (56%) was composed of individuals who had a healthy diet (i.e., low fat and high fiber), exercised regularly, and who frequently engaged in behaviors that prevent oral and skin-related diseases. In contrast, the Unhealthy group (44%) rarely engaged in these health-promoting behaviors. Using structural equation modeling we found a negative relation between emotional intelligence and unhealthy behaviors relative to health-promoting ones. Mediation analyses indicated that the mechanism explaining said relation was through increments in health consciousness, with large standardized indirect effects ranging between -0.52 and -0.78. As health behaviors during early adulthood are salient predictors of health outcomes in old age, the results have clear implications for the inclusion of emotional intelligence training in programs seeking to raise health awareness and cultivate health promoting behaviors in young adults, in so much as to seek to reduce the risk of chronic ailments later in life.", "Materials with synchronous capabilities of color change and actuation have prospects for application in biomimetic dual-stealth camouflage and artificial intelligence. However, color/shape dual-responsive devices involve stimuli that are difficult to control such as gas, light or magnetism, and the devices show poor coordination. Here, a flexible composite film with electrochromic/actuating (238\u00b0 bending angle) dual-responsive phenomena, excellent reversibility, high synchronization, and fast response speed (< 5\u2009s) utilizes a single active component, W18O49 nanowires. From in situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction, first principles calculations/numerical simulations, and a series of control experiments, the actuating mechanism for macroscopic deformation is elucidated as pseudocapacitance-based reversible lattice contraction/recovery of W18O49 nanowires (i.e. nanostructure change at the atomic level) during lithium ion intercalation/de-intercalation. In addition, we demonstrate the W18O49 nanowires in a solid-state ionic polymer-metal composite actuator that operates stably in air with a significant pseudocapacitive actuation.", "Multiparametric MR imaging is being used for prostate cancer diagnosis. However, many cancers are missed and the performance needs to improve before it can be used for population-level screening. We can expect standardization of multiparametric MR imaging and increased use of quantitative multiparametric MR imaging, which will lead to more reproducible results and improved interpretation. The development and integration of new acquisition techniques and use of artificial intelligence for image interpretation can lead to implementation of new clinical MR methods. These will lead to increased adoption of multiparametric MR imaging for prostate cancer diagnosis and for guiding intervention and follow-up.", "Resistance bands are often used in resistance training programs for older adults. Despite their widespread use, there is a lack of objective assessment of the actual strength, speed and precision of the movements during these exercises. Therefore, this paper presents the development of a sensorised resistance-band and a preliminary trial of activities classification by using artificial intelligence. The results show that in the preliminary trial, the classification accuracy of 4 different activities reached over 96% using accelerometer data only. A future study will be based on the sensorised resistance band to quantify resistance band exercises objectively in elderly people.", "The attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common psychiatric disorder that interferes with the typical development and both learning and motor functioning in a child's life. Most of the children with ADHD present also sleep problems like difficulties in falling asleep and maintaining sleep. Sleep spindles are characteristic waves of sleep stage 2 in humans and are characterized by a fusiform morphology. In the last years, the empirical evidence indicates that spindles are associated with cognitive faculties and intelligence as well as with several disease states. On the other hand, power spectral analysis of EEG represents a powerful noninvasive tool for examining cerebral behavior. The aim of this study is to evaluate the differences between ADHD and healthy children of the power spectral values in delta, theta, alpha, beta and gamma bands, before, during and after sleep spindles. Our results show significant differences concentrated in the period immediately after spindle epochs, in the left hemisphere of the brain, in almost all bands, with greater values in control than in ADHD children.", "We aimed to explore whether parents of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) had impaired emotion recognition abilities and whether this deficit was related to their children's autistic symptoms.\nThe autistic symptoms of 31 ASD children were assessed using the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R). Fifty parents of ASD children and 34 parents of typically developing (TD) children completed an emotion recognition task (ERT).\nThe numbers of correct ERT responses were lower for parents of ASD children than for parents of TD children with respect to recognizing sadness, disgust, fear, and all emotions (P=0.01, 0.04, 0.02, and 0.00, respectively). Controlled for parental age, gender, and the intelligence quotients of both the parents and children, a negative correlation was found between the total number of correct ERT responses for parents of ASD children and these children's \"restricted, repetitive, and stereotyped patterns of behavior\" scores on the ADI-R (r=-0.32; P=0.03).\nParents of ASD children showed impaired emotion recognition abilities compared with parents of TD children. This parental deficit in emotion recognition ability was related to the autistic symptoms of ASD children.", "An increased risk of impaired intelligence (IQ) has been documented in valproate-exposed children, but investigations have not previously focused on those with a clinical diagnosis of Fetal Valproate Syndrome (FVS).\nThis cross sectional observational study recruited individuals with a diagnosis of FVS and completed standardized assessments of intellectual abilities making comparisons to a normative comparison group. Both mean difference (MD) and prevalence of scores below the lower average range were analyzed.\nThe mean full-scale IQ in 31 individuals with FVS (mean age 14.97; range 6-27\u202fyears) was 19 points lower (19.55, 95% CI -24.94 to 14.15), and IQ scores <70 were present in 26%. The mean differences for verbal comprehension (21.07, 95% CI -25.84 to -16.29), working memory (19.77, 95% CI -25.00 to -14.55) and processing speed (16.87, 95% CI -22.24 to -11.50) performances were poorer than expected with the mean differences over one standard deviation from the comparison group. Sixty one percent of cases demonstrated disproportionately lower verbal comprehension ability. There were no significant group differences for IQ in high vs. moderate dose valproate or mono vs. polytherapy. There were no differences in IQ between those with and those without a major congenital malformation. The requirement for educational intervention was high at 74%.\nIntellectual difficulties are a central feature of FVS and are more severe in their presentation in individuals with a diagnosis of valproate embryopathy. Individuals with FVS who present with the characteristic facial presentation should be considered at high risk of cognitive difficulties regardless of the dose of valproate exposure or the presence of a major congenital malformation.", "This article was migrated. The article was marked as recommended. Virtual scenarios provide a means for creating rich and complex online cases for health professional students to explore. However, the response options available to the learner are usually predefined, which limits the utility of virtual patients. Using artificial intelligence or natural language processing to accommodate such flexibility is expensive and hard to design. This project description lays out an alternative approach to making virtual scenarios more adaptable and interactive. Using OpenLabyrinth, an open-source educational research platform, we modified the interface and functionality to provide a human-computer hybrid interface, where a human facilitator can interact with learners from within the online case scenario. Using a design-based research approach, we have iteratively improved our cases, workflows and scripts and interface designs. The next step is testing this new functionality in a variety of situations. This report describes the pilot implementation of this pilot project. It includes the background, rationale, objectives, learning and educational designs, and implications for software development. The costs and time required to modify the software were much lower than anticipated. Facilitators managed text input from multiple concurrent learners. Learners noted a delay while waiting for the facilitator's response, but denied becoming frustrated. The implementation and use of this new technique seems promising for training and assessment purposes related to developing effective communication skills. This report also explores the provisional implications arising from the study so far.", "The advent of brain reading techniques has enabled new approaches to the study of concept representation, based on the analysis of multivoxel activation patterns evoked by the contemplation of individual concepts such as animal concepts. The present fMRI study characterized the representation of 30 animal concepts. Dimensionality reduction of the multivoxel activation patterns underlying the individual animal concepts indicated that the semantic building blocks of the brain's representations of the animals corresponded to intrinsic animal properties (e.g. fierceness, intelligence, size). These findings were compared to behavioral studies of concept representation, which have typically collected pairwise similarity ratings between two concepts (e.g. Henley, 1969). Behavioral similarity judgments, by contrast, indicated that the animals were organized into taxonomically defined groups (e.g. canine, feline, equine). The difference in the results between the brain reading and behavioral approaches might derive from differences in cognitive processing during judging similarities versus contemplating one animal at a time. Brain reading approaches may have an advantage in describing thoughts about an individual concept, owing to the ability to decode brain activation patterns elicited by the brief consideration of a single concept (e.g. word reading) without a complex cognitive or behavioral task (e.g. similarity judgments). On the other hand, some behavioral tasks may tend to evoke a concept from numerous perspectives, yielding a representation of the breadth and sophistication of the concept knowledge. These results suggest that neural and behavioral measures offer complementary perspectives that together characterize the content and structure of concept representations.", "Many of our experiences in hospice and palliative care medicine are challenging. We support dying patients and their families as they struggle with the transition from life to death and continue to support those in mourning. Many times, in America, it is difficult to even appreciate a glimmer of spiritual grace as our patients die. We easily remain stuck in the material and distance ourselves from the spiritual. Some exits are quite graceful, however. I present the case of an exceptional person, who enjoyed an exceptional life and had an exceptionally graceful dying process and death, in hopes that his story may encourage other healers as much as he inspired me. Bruno was a composer and cognitive musicologist, whose art forms of light and music simultaneously move and challenge virtually all the people and other artists he interfaced with and taught, including his talented wife and family, his friends, his acquaintances, his students, his colleagues, and his deans. He embodied theories as diverse as mathematical strange loops, continually paradoxical/recursive illusory art, contrapuntal fugues, and artificial intelligence. Bruno's spirituality was uncommonly profound. It spanned and interconnected many eclectic faith traditions, theologies, and philosophies, including Taoism, Greek mythology, distributed cognition, mathematics, and Tibetan Buddhism. It resonated strongly with Zen and Christian mysticism. Some of Bruno's being and transformation to nonbeing was obvious; some of it was inscrutable.", "A World Health Organization 2017 report stated that major depression affects almost 5% of the human population. Major depression is associated with impaired psychosocial functioning and reduced quality of life. Challenges such as shortage of mental health personnel, long waiting times, perceived stigma, and lower government spends pose barriers to the alleviation of mental health problems. Face-to-face psychotherapy alone provides only point-in-time support and cannot scale quickly enough to address this growing global public health challenge. Artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled, empathetic, and evidence-driven conversational mobile app technologies could play an active role in filling this gap by increasing adoption and enabling reach. Although such a technology can help manage these barriers, they should never replace time with a health care professional for more severe mental health problems. However, app technologies could act as a supplementary or intermediate support system. Mobile mental well-being apps need to uphold privacy and foster both short- and long-term positive outcomes.\nThis study aimed to present a preliminary real-world data evaluation of the effectiveness and engagement levels of an AI-enabled, empathetic, text-based conversational mobile mental well-being app, Wysa, on users with self-reported symptoms of depression.\nIn the study, a group of anonymous global users were observed who voluntarily installed the Wysa app, engaged in text-based messaging, and self-reported symptoms of depression using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. On the basis of the extent of app usage on and between 2 consecutive screening time points, 2 distinct groups of users (high users and low users) emerged. The study used mixed-methods approach to evaluate the impact and engagement levels among these users. The quantitative analysis measured the app impact by comparing the average improvement in symptoms of depression between high and low users. The qualitative analysis measured the app engagement and experience by analyzing in-app user feedback and evaluated the performance of a machine learning classifier to detect user objections during conversations.\nThe average mood improvement (ie, difference in pre- and post-self-reported depression scores) between the groups (ie, high vs low users; n=108 and n=21, respectively) revealed that the high users group had significantly higher average improvement (mean 5.84 [SD 6.66]) compared with the low users group (mean 3.52 [SD 6.15]); Mann-Whitney P=.03 and with a moderate effect size of 0.63. Moreover, 67.7% of user-provided feedback responses found the app experience helpful and encouraging.\nThe real-world data evaluation findings on the effectiveness and engagement levels of Wysa app on users with self-reported symptoms of depression show promise. However, further work is required to validate these initial findings in much larger samples and across longer periods.", "Intelligence in large-brained vertebrates might have evolved through independent, yet similar processes based on comparable socioecological pressures and slow life histories. This convergent evolutionary route, however, cannot explain why cephalopods developed large brains and flexible behavioural repertoires: cephalopods have fast life histories and live in simple social environments. Here, we suggest that the loss of the external shell in cephalopods (i) caused a dramatic increase in predatory pressure, which in turn prevented the emergence of slow life histories, and (ii) allowed the exploitation of novel challenging niches, thus favouring the emergence of intelligence. By highlighting convergent and divergent aspects between cephalopods and large-brained vertebrates we illustrate how the evolution of intelligence might not be constrained to a single evolutionary route.", "Intracranial germ cell tumors (GCT) are more common in Asia than in the West, accounting for about 15% of brain tumors in Asian children. The survival rate for intracranial GCT is excellent, but there are concerns about the effects of radiotherapy on neuropsychological function and quality of life of patients.\nIntracranial germ cell tumors (GCT) are more common in Asia than in the West, accounting for about 15% of brain tumors in Asian children. The survival rate for intracranial GCT is excellent, but there are concerns about the effects of radiotherapy on neuropsychological function and quality of life of patients. Intracranial GCT survivors in Hong Kong aged\u2009\u2265\u20096\u00a0years who received cranial irradiation in the past 15\u00a0years were recruited. Neurocognitive function and performance status were assessed by the Hong Kong Wechsler Intelligence scale and Karnofsky/Lansky performance scales (KPS), respectively. Quality of life was assessed using the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) Generic Core Scales. A chart review was performed for tumor characteristics and complications related to the tumor and its treatment.\nTwenty-five intracranial GCT survivors were recruited. Longer length of time since treatment was associated with lower IQ scores. Larger tumor size was associated with lower KPS scores. Hemiparesis, poor manual dexterity, and complications with multi-organ involvement were associated with significantly lower KPS scores. Higher irradiation dosage was associated with lower PedsQL physical scores.\nThe majority of GCT survivors had average intellectual functioning, satisfactory performance status and relatively good quality of life, except in the physical aspect. Comprehensive evaluation and long-term follow-up of GCT survivors are essential to provide timely support and improve long-term outcomes.", "Aim: Multiple sclerosis is a severe brain and/or spinal cord disease. It may lead to a wide range of symptoms. Hence, the early diagnosis and treatment is quite important. Method: This study proposed a 14-layer convolutional neural network, combined with three advanced techniques: batch normalization, dropout, and stochastic pooling. The output of the stochastic pooling was obtained via sampling from a multinomial distribution formed from the activations of each pooling region. In addition, we used data augmentation method to enhance the training set. In total 10 runs were implemented with the hold-out randomly set for each run. Results: The results showed that our 14-layer CNN secured a sensitivity of 98.77 \u00b1 0.35%, a specificity of 98.76 \u00b1 0.58%, and an accuracy of 98.77 \u00b1 0.39%. Conclusion: Our results were compared with CNN using maximum pooling and average pooling. The comparison shows stochastic pooling gives better performance than other two pooling methods. Furthermore, we compared our proposed method with six state-of-the-art approaches, including five traditional artificial intelligence methods and one deep learning method. The comparison shows our method is superior to all other six state-of-the-art approaches.", "The characterization of the functional significance of interindividual variation in brain morphometry is a core aim of cognitive neuroscience. Prior research has focused on interindividual variation at the level of regional brain measures thus overlooking the fact that each individual brain is a person-specific ensemble of interdependent regions. To expand this line of inquiry we introduce the person-based similarity index (PBSI) for brain morphometry. The conceptual unit of the PBSI is the individual person's brain structural profile which considers all relevant morphometric measures as features of a single vector. In 2 independent cohorts (total of 1756 healthy participants), we demonstrate the foundational validity of this approach by affirming that the PBSI scores for subcortical volume and cortical thickness in healthy individuals differ between men and women, are heritable, and robust to variation in neuroimaging parameters, sample composition, and regional brain morphometry. Moreover, the PBSI scores correlate with age, body mass index, and fluid intelligence. Collectively, these results suggest that the person-based measures of brain morphometry are biologically and functionally meaningful and have the potential to advance the study of human variation in multivariate brain imaging phenotypes in healthy and clinical populations.", "Worldwide spending on long-term and chronic care conditions is increasing to a point that requires immediate interventions and advancements to reduce the burden of the healthcare cost. This research is focused on early detection of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) using wearable technology. An artificial intelligence model was developed based on adaptive-neuro fuzzy interference to detect prediabetes and T2DM via individualized monitoring. The key contributing factors to the proposed model include heart rate, heart rate variability, breathing rate, breathing volume, and activity data (steps, cadence and calories). The data was collected using an advanced wearable body vest. The real-time data was combined with manual recordings of blood glucose, height, weight, age and sex. The model analyzed the data alongside a clinical knowledge-base. Fuzzy rules were used to establish baseline values via existing interventions, clinical guidelines and protocols. The proposed model was tested and validated using Kappa analysis and achieved an overall agreement of 91%.", "Although there is good evidence that social animals show elaborate cognitive skills to deal with others, there are few reports of animals physically using social agents and their respective responses as means to an end-social tool use. In this case study, we investigated spontaneous and repeated social tool use behavior in chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes). We presented a group of chimpanzees with an apparatus, in which pushing two buttons would release juice from a distantly located fountain. Consequently, any one individual could only either push the buttons or drink from the fountain but never push and drink simultaneously. In this scenario, an adult male attempted to retrieve three other individuals and push them toward the buttons that, if pressed, released juice from the fountain. With this strategy, the social tool user increased his juice intake 10-fold. Interestingly, the strategy was stable over time, which was possibly enabled by playing with the social tools. With over 100 instances, we provide the biggest data set on social tool use recorded among nonhuman animals so far. The repeated use of other individuals as social tools may represent a complex social skill linked to Machiavellian intelligence.

However, this morphology is still unknown to science in the case of Saimiri collinsi. As a means of assisting future studies on the social behavior of this species, we analyzed the brains of six adult females from the National Primate Center / Par\u00e1, which were sent to the Animal Morphological Research Laboratory at the Federal Rural University of Amaz\u00f4nia after death by natural causes. The animals were fixed in formaldehyde solution (10%) and dissected. The brains were covered externally by the dura mater, with long cerebral hemispheres, although there was a complete absence of gyri. The internal structures which form a part of the telencephalon, diencephalon, midbrain, hindbrain and myelencephalon were identified, with the exception of the mammillary bodies. This condition, when linked to the lissencephaly found in these individuals raises questions about the real learning abilities of this species.", "Purpose To compare breast cancer detection performance of radiologists reading mammographic examinations unaided versus supported by an artificial intelligence (AI) system. Materials and Methods An enriched retrospective, fully crossed, multireader, multicase, HIPAA-compliant study was performed. Screening digital mammographic examinations from 240 women (median age, 62 years; range, 39-89 years) performed between 2013 and 2017 were included. The 240 examinations (100 showing cancers, 40 leading to false-positive recalls, 100 normal) were interpreted by 14 Mammography Quality Standards Act-qualified radiologists, once with and once without AI support. The readers provided a Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System score and probability of malignancy. AI support provided radiologists with interactive decision support (clicking on a breast region yields a local cancer likelihood score), traditional lesion markers for computer-detected abnormalities, and an examination-based cancer likelihood score. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), specificity and sensitivity, and reading time were compared between conditions by using mixed-models analysis dof variance and generalized linear models for multiple repeated measurements. Results On average, the AUC was higher with AI support than with unaided reading (0.89 vs 0.87, respectively; P = .002). Sensitivity increased with AI support (86% [86 of 100] vs 83% [83 of 100]; P = .046), whereas specificity trended toward improvement (79% [111 of 140]) vs 77% [108 of 140]; P = .06). Reading time per case was similar (unaided, 146 seconds; supported by AI, 149 seconds; P = .15). The AUC with the AI system alone was similar to the average AUC of the radiologists (0.89 vs 0.87). Conclusion Radiologists improved their cancer detection at mammography when using an artificial intelligence system for support, without requiring additional reading time.

Focused on using automated DL-based systems to improve point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS), we look at DL-based automation as a key field in expanding and improving POCUS applications in various clinical settings. A promising additional value would be the ability to automate training model selections for teaching POCUS to medical trainees and novice sonologists. The diversity of POCUS applications and ultrasound equipment, each requiring specialized AI models and domain expertise, limits the use of DL as a generic solution. In this article, we highlight the most advanced potential applications of AI in POCUS tailored to high-yield models in automated image interpretations, with the premise of improving the accuracy and efficacy of POCUS scans.", "Transition metal dichalcogenides have attracted significant attention due to both fundamental interest and their potential applications. Here, we have systematically explored the crystal structures of ReX2 (X = S, Se, and Te) over the pressure range of 0-300 GPa, employing swarm-intelligence-based structure prediction methodology. Several new structures are found to be stable at high pressures. The calculated enthalpy of formation suggested that all predicted high-pressure structures are stable against decomposition into elemental end-members. Moreover, we found that the simulated X-ray diffraction patterns of ReSe2 are in good agreement with experimental data. Pressure-induced metallization of ReX2 has been revealed from the analysis of its electronic structure. Our electron-phonon coupling calculations indicate ReSe2 and ReTe2 are superconducting phases at high pressures.", "The years since the publication of Machiavellian Intelligence have witnessed a golden age in discoveries concerning social cognition in human and nonhuman primates and many other animal taxa too. Here, I briefly dissect some of the variants of the social intelligence hypotheses that have evolved in this time and offer a selective overview of the scientific discoveries in this field, particularly in primates, over the last 30 years.

Office workers in particular are at an increased risk due to their extensive amounts of occupational SB. However, we still lack an objective method to measure SB consistent with its definition. We have therefore developed a new measurement system based on muscular activity and accelerometry. The primary aim of the present study was to calibrate the new-developed 8-CH-EMG+ for measuring occupational SB against an indirect calorimeter during typical desk-based office work activities. In total, 25 volunteers performed nine office tasks at three typical workplaces. Minute-by-minute posture and activity classification was performed using subsequent decision trees developed with artificial intelligence data processing techniques. The 8-CH-EMG+ successfully identified all sitting episodes (AUC = 1.0). Furthermore, depending on the number of electromyography channels included, the device has a sensitivity of 83\u207b98% and 74\u207b98% to detect SB and active sitting (AUC = 0.85\u207b0.91). The 8-CH-EMG+ advances the field of objective SB measurements by combining accelerometry with muscular activity. Future field studies should consider the use of EMG sensors to record SB in line with its definition.", "The effectiveness of predictive models in supporting the Clinical Decision is closely related with their clinical interpretability, i.e.the model should provide clear information on how to reach a specific classification/decision. In fact, the development of interpretable and accurate predictive models assumes a key importance as these tools can be very useful in Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS). The development of those models may comprise two main perspectives; existent clinical knowledge (clinical expert knowledge, clinical guidelines, current models, etc.) as well as data driven approaches able to extract (new) knowledge from recent clinical datasets. This work focuses in knowledge extraction from recent datasets (data driven) based on computational intelligence techniques. The main hypothesis that supports this work is that individuals with similar characteristics present a similar risk prof ile. Thus, this work addresses the development of stratification models able to learn distinct groups (or classes) of subjects assessing the similarity between characterizing variables. In particular, in the current study a data-driven supervised cluster approach is proposed aiming the derivation of meaningful rules directly from the dataset. The validation was performed based on the largest Portuguese coronary artery disease patient's dataset, provided by the Portuguese Society of Cardiology and comprising 13902 acute coronary syndrome patients. The goal was to assess the risk of death 30 days after admission. The models' performance was assessed through the sensitivity, specificity and geometric mean values. The obtained results show the potential of this approach, as they represent an acceptable performance (GM= 72%) while the clinical interpretability of the model is assured through the derived rules. Despite the achieved results, there are several research directions to be followed in order to enhance this work.", "The purpose of this article is to discuss potential applications of artificial intelligence (AI) in breast imaging and limitations that may slow or prevent its adoption.\nThe algorithms of AI for workflow improvement and outcome analyses are advancing.

Supervised machine learning algorithms, the core intelligence of these systems, learn from labeled training data. However, labeling vast amount of data is time-consuming and expensive. Moreover, sensor data often contains personal information that a user may not be comfortable sharing. Therefore, there is a strong need to develop methods for generating realistic labeled sensor data. In this paper, we propose a supervised generative adversarial network architecture that learns from feedback from both a discriminator and a classifier in order to create synthetic sensor data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the architecture on a publicly available human activity dataset. We show that our generator learns to output diverse samples that are similar but not identical to the training data.", "Much has been published on whether newly graduated doctors are ready for practice, seeking to understand how to better prepare graduates for the workplace. Most studies focus on undergraduate education as preparation for internship by investigating knowledge and skills in relation to clinical proficiencies. The conversion from medical student to internship, however, is influenced not only by medical competencies, but also by personal characteristics and organisational skills. Most research focuses largely on the interns' own perceptions of their preparation. Supervisors who work closely with interns could therefore present alternative perspectives.\nTo explore the views of medical intern supervisors on the internship training context, as well as their perspectives on attributes that would help an intern to function optimally in the public health sector in South Africa (SA). This article intends to extend our current understanding of what contributes to a successful internship by including the views of internship supervisors.\nTwenty-seven semi-structured interviews were held with medical intern supervisors in 7 of the 9 provinces of SA. The data were thematically analysed and reported using an existing framework, the Work Readiness Scale.\nThe intern supervisors indicated that interns were challenged by the transition from student to doctor, having to adapt to a new environment, work long hours and deal with a large workload. Clinical competencies, as well as attributes related to organisational acumen, social intelligence and personal characteristics, were identified as being important to prepare interns for the workplace. Diligence, reliability, self-discipline and a willingness to work ('go the extra mile') emerged as key for a 'good' intern. The importance of organisational skills such as triage, prioritisation and participation was foregrounded, as were social skills such as teamwork and adaptability.\nThis article contributes to our understanding of what makes a successful medical internship by exploring the previously uncanvassed views of intern supervisors who are working at the coalface in the public health sector. It is envisaged that this work will stimulate debate among the medical fraternity on how best to prepare interns for the realities of the workplace. Educational institutions, health services and interns themselves need to take ownership of how to instil, develop and support these important attributes.", "The quality of input data in deep learning is tightly associated with the ultimate performance of the machine learner. Taking advantage of the unique merits of surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) methodology in the collection and construction of a database (e.g., abundant intrinsic fingerprint information, noninvasive data acquisition process, strong anti-interfering ability, etc.), herein we set up a SERS-based database of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), suitable for artificial intelligence (AI)-based sensing applications. The database is collected and analyzed by silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs)-decorated silicon wafer (Ag NPs@Si) SERS chip, followed by training with a deep neural network (DNN). As proof-of-concept applications, three kinds of representative tumor suppressor genes, i.e., p16, p21, and p53 fragments, are readily discriminated in a label-free manner. Prominent and reproducible SERS spectra of these DNA molecules are collected and employed as input data for DNN learning and training, which enables selective discrimination of DNA target(s). The accuracy rate for the recognition of specific DNA target reached 90.28%.", "According to guidelines, endoscopic resection should only be performed for patients whose early gastric cancer invasion depth is within the mucosa or submucosa of the stomach regardless of lymph node involvement. The accurate prediction of invasion depth based on endoscopic images is crucial for screening patients for endoscopic resection. We constructed a convolutional neural network computer-aided detection (CNN-CAD) system based on endoscopic images to determine invasion depth and screen patients for endoscopic resection.\nEndoscopic images of gastric cancer tumors were obtained from the Endoscopy Center of Zhongshan Hospital. An artificial intelligence-based CNN-CAD system was developed through transfer learning leveraging a state-of-the-art pretrained CNN architecture, ResNet50. A total of 790 images served as a development dataset and another 203 images as a test dataset. We used the CNN-CAD system to determine the invasion depth of gastric cancer and evaluated the system's classification accuracy by calculating its sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve.\nThe area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the CNN-CAD system was .94 (95% confidence interval [CI], .90-.97). At a threshold value of .5, sensitivity was 76.47%, and specificity 95.56%. Overall accuracy was 89.16%. Positive and negative predictive values were 89.66% and 88.97%, respectively. The CNN-CAD system achieved significantly higher accuracy (by 17.25%; 95% CI, 11.63-22.59) and specificity (by 32.21%; 95% CI, 26.78-37.44) than human endoscopists.\nWe constructed a CNN-CAD system to determine the invasion depth of gastric cancer with high accuracy and specificity. This system distinguished early gastric cancer from deeper submucosal invasion and minimized overestimation of invasion depth, which could reduce unnecessary gastrectomy.", "Big data and deep learning will profoundly change various areas of professions and research in the future. This will also happen in medicine and medical imaging in particular. As medical physicists, we should pursue beyond the concept of technical quality to extend our methodology and competence towards measuring and optimising the diagnostic value in terms of how it is connected to care outcome. Functional implementation of such methodology requires data processing utilities starting from data collection and management and culminating in the data analysis methods. Data quality control and validation are prerequisites for the deep learning application in order to provide reliable further analysis, classification, interpretation, probabilistic and predictive modelling from the vast heterogeneous big data. Challenges in practical data analytics relate to both horizontal and longitudinal analysis aspects. Quantitative aspects of data validation, quality control, physically meaningful measures, parameter connections and system modelling for the future artificial intelligence (AI) methods are positioned firmly in the field of Medical Physics profession. It is our interest to ensure that our professional education, continuous training and competence will follow this significant global development.", "Thirty years on from the publication of Machiavellian Intelligence (Byrne & Whiten, 1988), it is time to consider how the ideas in it have influenced understanding of the evolution of intelligence, how they have been tested (and sometimes misunderstood), and whether they are still relevant today. This essay attempts to do so. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved).", "The size and shape of a nodule are the essential indicators of malignancy in lung cancer diagnosis. However, effectively capturing the nodule's structural information from CT scans in a computer-aided system is a challenging task. Unlike previous models that proposed computationally intensive deep ensemble models or three-dimensional CNN models, we propose a lightweight, multiple view sampling based multi-section CNN architecture. The model obtains a nodule's cross sections from multiple view angles and encodes the nodule's volumetric information into a compact representation by aggregating information from its different cross sections via a view pooling layer. The compact feature is subsequently used for the task of nodule classification. The method does not require the nodule's spatial annotation and works directly on the cross sections generated from volume enclosing the nodule. We evaluated the proposed method on lung image database consortium (LIDC) and image database resource initiative (IDRI) dataset. It achieved the state-of-the-art performance with a mean 93.18% classification accuracy. The architecture could also be used to select the representative cross sections determining the nodule's malignancy that facilitates in the interpretation of results. Because of being lightweight, the model could be ported to mobile devices, which brings the power of artificial intelligence (AI) driven application directly into the practitioner's hand.", "The appearance and the movements of immune cells are driven by their environment. As a reaction to a pathogen invasion, the immune cells are recruited to the site of inflammation and are activated to prevent a further spreading of the invasion. This is also reflected by changes in the behavior and the morphological appearance of the immune cells. In cancerous tissue, similar morphokinetic changes have been observed in the behavior of microglial cells: intra-tumoral microglia have less complex 3-dimensional shapes, having less-branched cellular processes, and move more rapidly than those in healthy tissue. The examination of such morphokinetic properties requires complex 3D microscopy techniques, which can be extremely challenging when executed longitudinally. Therefore, the recording of a static 3D shape of a cell is much simpler, because this does not require intravital measurements and can be performed on excised tissue as well. However, it is essential to possess analysis tools that allow the fast and precise description of the 3D shapes and allows the diagnostic classification of healthy and pathogenic tissue samples based solely on static, shape-related information. Here, we present a toolkit that analyzes the discrete Fourier components of the outline of a set of 2D projections of the 3D cell surfaces via Self-Organizing Maps. The application of artificial intelligence methods allows our framework to learn about various cell shapes as it is applied to more and more tissue samples, whilst the workflow remains simple.", "Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a highly prevalent childhood disorder with symptoms of inattention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity. EEG neurofeedback training (NFT) is a new intervention modality based on operant conditioning of brain activity, which helps reduce symptoms of ADHD in children.\nTo examine the efficacy of NFT in children with ADHD, an experimental longitudinal design with pre-post comparison was adopted. A total of 30 children in the age range of 6 to 12 years diagnosed as ADHD with or without comorbid conditions were assigned to treatment group (TG; n = 15) and treatment as usual group (TAU; n = 15). TG received EEG-NFT along with routine clinical management and TAU received routine clinical management alone. Forty sessions of theta/beta NFT at the C3 scalp location, 3 to 4 sessions in a week for a period of 3.5 to 5 months were given to children in TG. Children were screened using sociodemographic data and Binet-Kamat test of intelligence. Pre-and postassessment tools were neuropsychological tests and behavioral scales. Follow-up was carried out on 8 children in TG using parent-rated behavioral measures.\nImprovement was reported in TG on cognitive functions (sustained attention, verbal working memory, and response inhibition), parent- and teacher-rated behavior problems and on academic performance rated by teachers. Follow-up of children who received NFT showed sustained improvement in ADHD symptoms when assessed 6 months after receiving NFT.\nThe present study suggests that NFT is an effective method to enhance cognitive deficits and helps reduce ADHD symptoms and behavior problems. Consequently, academic performance was found to be improved in children with ADHD. Improvement in ADHD symptoms induced by NFT were maintained at 6-month follow-up in children with ADHD.", "To evaluate the effect of radiotherapy interruption (RTI) in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) receiving intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT).\nA total of 7826 patients using the well-established big-data intelligence platform were identified. Computer-generated random numbers were used to assign these patients into a training cohort (n\u202f=\u202f3913 patients) and an internal validation cohort (n\u202f=\u202f3913 patients). RTI was defined as the difference between radiation treatment time and planned radiation time (assuming a Monday start). Survival analysis was performed using the Kaplan-Meier method for survival, and log-rank test to evaluate difference. Optimal RTI threshold was identified using the recursive partitioning analyses (RPAs). Multivariate analysis was performed using the Weibull model. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS).\nThe optimal threshold of RTI with respect to OS in the training cohort was 6.5 d based on RPAs. Therefore, a uniform threshold of 7 d (<7 vs. \u22657 d) was selected to classify both training and validation cohorts into high and low RTI groups for survival analysis. RTI of \u22657 d showed significant detrimental effects on OS in both training (5-y OS, 82.4% vs 86.5%; P\u202f=\u202f0.001) and validation cohorts (5-y OS, 85.2% vs 86.7%; P\u202f=\u202f0.013) than those patients with RTI of <7 d. Consistent with results of the univariate analysis, RTI of \u22657 d was found to be an independent unfavorable prognostic factor for OS in both training (HR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.14-1.95; P\u202f=\u202f0.003) and validation cohort (HR, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.07-1.65; P\u202f=\u202f0.031). Subgroup analysis showed that RTI of \u22657 d had significant adverse effects on prognosis of NPC patients receiving IMRT, regardless of TNM stage and chemotherapy (P\u202f<\u202f0.05 for all).\nIn the IMRT era, RTI independently influences survival. Raising RTI\u202f\u2265\u202f7 d was consistently unfavorable for NPC survival. Medical practitioners must remind patients on the importance of minimizing RT interruptions.", "Radiological Oncology, like the rest of medical specialties, is beginning to provide can personalized therapies. The ongoing scientific advances enable a great degree of precision in diagnoses and therapies. To fight cancer, from a radiotherapy unit, requires up-to-date equipment, professionals with different specialties working in synchrony (doctors, physicists, biologists, etc.) and a lot of research. Some of the new therapeutic tendencies are immunotherapy, nanoparticles, gene therapy, biomarkers, artificial intelligence, etc. A new clinical paradigm in which new professional networks are inevitable is arising. The mission of translational research is to become a scientific engine in the clinical space.", "Rising prevalence of diabetes worldwide has necessitated the implementation of population-based diabetic retinopathy (DR) screening programs that can perform retinal imaging and interpretation for extremely large patient cohorts in a rapid and sensitive manner while minimizing inappropriate referrals to retina specialists. While most current screening programs employ mydriatic or nonmydriatic color fundus photography and trained image graders to identify referable DR, new imaging modalities offer significant improvements in diagnostic accuracy, throughput, and affordability. Smartphone-based fundus photography, macular optical coherence tomography, ultrawide-field imaging, and artificial intelligence-based image reading address limitations of current approaches and will likely become necessary as DR becomes more prevalent. Here we review current trends in imaging for DR screening and emerging technologies that show potential for improving upon current screening approaches.", "We evaluate the spectral resolution and the detection thresholds achievable for a photoacoustic spectroscopy (PAS) system in the broadband infrared wavelength region 3270 n m \u2272 \u03bb \u2272 3530 n m driven by a continuous wave optical parametric oscillator (OPO) with P \u00af \u2248 1.26 W . The absorption spectra, I PAS ( \u03bb i ) , for diluted propane, ethane and methane test gases at low concentrations ( c \u223c 100 ppm ) were measured for \u223c1350 discrete wavelengths \u03bb i . The I PAS ( \u03bb i ) spectra were then compared to the high resolution cross section data, \u03c3 FTIR , obtained by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy published in the HITRAN database. Deviations of 7.1(6)% for propane, 8.7(11)% for ethane and 15.0(14)% for methane with regard to the average uncertainty between I PAS ( \u03bb i ) and the expected reference values based on \u03c3 FTIR were recorded. The characteristic absorption wavelengths \u03bb res can be resolved with an average resolution of \u03b4 \u03bb res \u223c 0.08 nm . Detection limits range between 7.1 ppb (ethane) to 13.6 ppb (methane). In an additional step, EUREQA, an artificial intelligence (AI) program, was successfully applied to deconvolute simulated PAS spectra of mixed gas samples at low limits of detection. The results justify a further development of PAS technology to support e.g., biomedical research.", "Research shows that maltreated children are at elevated risk of arrest as adults and that higher verbal intelligence, reading ability, and executive functioning (abstract reasoning and cognitive flexibility) may be protective against criminal behavior. The current study examines this hypothesis using data from court-substantiated cases of child abuse and neglect and demographically matched controls followed prospectively into middle adulthood ( N = 1,196). At age 29, verbal intelligence was assessed with the Quick Test and reading ability with the Wide Range Achievement Test-Revised. At age 41, abstract reasoning was assessed with the Matrix Reasoning Test and cognitive flexibility with the Trail Making Test-B. Arrest records were gathered from law enforcement agencies through mean age 51. Data were analyzed with binomial logistic regressions. The results indicated that maltreated children were at increased risk of arrest for nonviolent and violent crime. Higher verbal intelligence, reading ability, nonverbal reasoning, and cognitive flexibility were protective against arrest for violent crime. The protective effects of neuropsychological functions were more pronounced for violent than nonviolent crime, for the control than maltreated children, and differed by gender and race. These results suggest that interventions targeting improved cognitive and neuropsychological functions may serve an important role in reducing risk of crime.", "Objective: This study investigated confidence accuracy associations for emotion recognition (ER) in children with ADHD and typically developing children (TD). Method: Thirty-nine children with ADHD and 42 TD (M = 9 years, 11 months, SD = 14.92 months, 26 females) completed an ER task. Intelligence and executive function task performance were also measured. Results: The ADHD group was more confident on ER compared with TD, but no group differences were found on their overall accuracy. Specifically, the ADHD group was more confident in its recognition of sad and angry faces compared with the TD group. On a metacognitive index, the ADHD group displayed lower resolution, suggesting that the TD group was better at discriminating correct from incorrect responses. Higher resolution was associated with lower ADHD symptoms. Conclusion: Confidence ratings with reference to performance on a specific task can provide an index of social-cognition in children with ADHD.", "A growing number of studies indicate increased impulsivity in patients with opioid dependence (OD). However, few studies exclude concomitant drug use and consider depression as a comorbidity, both of which can bias results.\nWe aimed to compare impulsivity in patients with OD enrolled in maintenance therapy (ICD code F11.22) and well-matched healthy controls taking psychopathological impairments into account. Furthermore, we compared the result to risky behavioral patterns in patients.\nThis cross-sectional study included 50 patients with OD enrolled in either methadone or buprenorphine maintenance therapy and 50 healthy controls matched for gender, age, education, marital status, and premorbid intelligence. Abstinence from benzodiazepines, amphetamines, and cocaine was verified by urine analysis. We used the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale 11 (BIS-11), Beck's Depression Inventory (BDI), the Symptom Checklist 90 Revised (SCL-90R), and the European version of the Addiction Severity Index (EuropASI).\nPatients exhibited significantly worse impulse control than healthy individuals. We found no correlation between impulsiveness and reported risky behavior patterns but found a significant correlation between depressive symptoms and psychopathological impairment.\nPatients with OD showed a higher impulsivity than healthy individuals. Impulsivity could be a cause or a consequence of a substance use disorder; further research is warranted to explain this relationship. Impulsivity was associated with depression, an important confounder; future research needs to take this into account.", "Cephalometric analysis has long been, and still is one of the most important tools in evaluating craniomaxillofacial skeletal profile. To perform this, manual tracing of x-ray film and plotting landmarks have been required. This procedure is time-consuming and demands expertise. In these days, computerized cephalometric systems have been introduced; however, tracing and plotting still have to be done on the monitor display. Artificial intelligence is developing rapidly. Deep learning is one of the most evolving areas in artificial intelligence. The authors made an automated landmark predicting system, based on a deep learning neural network.\nOn a personal desktop computer, a convolutional network was built for regression analysis of cephalometric landmarks' coordinate values. Lateral cephalogram images were gathered through the internet and 219 images were obtained. Ten skeletal cephalometric landmarks were manually plotted and coordinate values of them were listed. The images were randomly divided into 153 training images and 66 testing images. Training images were expanded 51 folds. The network was trained with the expanded training images. With the testing images, landmarks were predicted by the network. Prediction errors from manually plotted points were evaluated.\nAverage and median prediction errors were 17.02 and 16.22 pixels. Angles and lengths in cephalometric analysis, predicted by the neural network, were not statistically different from those calculated from manually plotted points.\nDespite the variety of image quality, using cephalogram images on the internet is a feasible approach for landmark prediction.", "Nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC) are biocompatible and biodegradable nanoscale systems with extensive application for controlled drug release. However, the development of optimal nanosystems along with a reproducible manufacturing process is still challenging. In this study, a two-step experimental design was performed and databases were successfully modelled using Artificial Intelligence techniques as an innovative method to get optimal, reproducible and stable NLC. The initial approach, including a wide range of values for the different variables, was followed by a second set of experiments with variable values in a narrower range, more suited to the characteristics of the system. NLC loaded with rifabutin, a hydrophobic drug model, were produced by hot homogenization and fully characterized in terms of particle size, size distribution, zeta potential, encapsulation efficiency and drug loading. The use of Artificial Intelligence tools has allowed to elucidate the key parameters that modulate each formulation property. Stable nanoparticles with low sizes and polydispersions, negative zeta potentials and high drug loadings were obtained when the proportion of lipid components, drug, surfactants and stirring speed were optimized by FormRules\u00ae and INForm\u00ae. The successful application of Artificial Intelligence tools on NLC formulation optimization constitutes a pioneer approach in the field of lipid nanoparticles.", "The adaptation of individually administered psychological tests from paper to app-based administration formats can present unique threats to the construct and raw-score equivalence of the paper and digital formats. We discuss these potential threats and describe a study evaluating the equivalence of paper and digital versions of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, fifth edition (WISC-V), which has been adapted to an app-based testing platform called Q-interactive. The present study (N = 350) used an equivalent-groups design to assess the raw-score equivalence of 18 WISC-V subtests that were designed with the intent of minimizing format effect. Effect sizes in standard deviation units were small, ranging from -0.20 to 0.20 (mean absolute value = 0.09), and format effects were unrelated to ability level, age, sex, or parent education. These results suggest that when tests are designed or adapted with digital-paper equivalence as a goal, digital-paper raw-score equivalence can be achieved across a variety of construct domains.

Machine learning refers to the ability of computer programs to adapt when exposed to new data. Here we examine the use of machine learning for use with untargeted metabolomics data, when it is appropriate to use, and questions it can answer. We provide an example workflow for training and testing a simple binary classifier, a multiclass classifier and a support vector machine using the Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis (Weka), a toolkit for machine learning. This workflow should provide a framework for greater integration of machine learning with metabolomics study.", "Multiple interventions in the aging process have been discovered to extend the healthspan of model organisms. Both industry and academia are therefore exploring possible transformative molecules that target aging and age-associated diseases. In this overview, we summarize the presented talks and discussion points of the 5th Annual Aging and Drug Discovery Forum 2018 in Basel, Switzerland. Here academia and industry came together, to discuss the latest progress and issues in aging research. The meeting covered talks about the mechanistic cause of aging, how longevity signatures may be highly conserved, emerging biomarkers of aging, possible interventions in the aging process and the use of artificial intelligence for aging research and drug discovery. Importantly, a consensus is emerging both in industry and academia, that molecules able to intervene in the aging process may contain the potential to transform both societies and healthcare.", "Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common neurobehavioral disorder in children, but its specific etiology and pathophysiology are still incompletely understood.\nThis case-control study aimed to measure the level of serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) as a predictor of the immunologic status in children with ADHD, and to study its correlation with severity of symptoms.\n60 ADHD children who met the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition, criteria for ADHD and 60 control children were subjected to complete history taking, clinical examination, and psychometric tests. Serum interleukin-6 of ADHD patients and control children was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.\nThe mean serum level of IL-6 was 22.35 (95% confidence interval [CI], 17.68-26.99) in ADHD patients, and it was 5.44 (95% CI, 4.81-6.06) in controls. A significantly higher level of IL-6 was reported in ADHD patients compared with controls ( P = .001). No significant correlation was found between serum IL-6 level and either the Intelligence Quotient (IQ) or the Conners' Parent Rating Scale score.\nSerum IL-6 values were significantly higher in ADHD patients compared to healthy control children. Increased production of IL-6 may play a role in the pathogenesis of ADHD.", "The history of drug safety monitoring, or pharmacovigilance, has been an interesting one. Despite many and ongoing changes, it has typically been characterized by a rather slow-moving and reactive progression. Pharmacovigilance has always lagged behind other fields and industries and has been slow to adapt to new approaches. The main aspect holding it back has been a focus on the administrative and adherence side of creating individual case safety reports (ICSRs) and distributing these reports to the various stakeholders per strict regulatory requirements. Now, in 2018, we are more behind the curve than ever, and the field seems to be at a breaking point, calling for urgent and drastic changes. The question at hand is whether in this era of an abundance of electronically available data and technological advancements, which allow the application of automation, this process still makes sense. Is there still a place for creating and redistributing ICSRs from marketed use in a current, state-of-the-art safety system? Artificial intelligence, deep machine learning, and related technologies are already in place in many other industries. Swift and rigorous change is necessary for the discipline of pharmacovigilance to keep up with what is happening in the world at large.", "Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have reported an inconsistent relationship about the auditory integration training (AIT) in children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) among Chinese. The current study was to investigate the efficacy of AIT for children with ASD compared with those in control group by using meta-analysis. Relevant trials published were identified by an electronic search of PubMed, CENTRAL, EMBASE, WanFang, CNKI, and SinoMed databases up to December 31, 2017. Outcome of interest included childhood autism rating scale (CARS), autism behavior checklist (ABC), intelligence quotient (IQ), and autism treatment evaluation checklist (ATEC). Standardized mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) was calculated using a random-effect model. Thirteen RCTs with 976 children with ASD were included for analysis. The pooled SMD showed that children with ASD had significantly lower ABC scores [summary SMD = -0.58, 95%CI = -0.79 to -0.38] and ATEC scores [summary SMD = -0.75, 95%CI = -1.05 to -0.45] in AIT group compared with that in control group. The analysis of pooled statistics put forward AIT could increase the IQ score when compared with that in control group [summary SMD = 0.59, 95%CI = 0.41-0.77]. A negative association was found about CARS scores between AIT group and control group. No publication bias was found and no single study had essential effect on the pooled results. In conclusions, AIT can reduce the score of ABC and ATEC and can increase the IQ score among children with ASD in Chinese. Therefore, it is recommended for Chinese children with ASD to receive AIT.", "Although air pollution is well known to be harmful to the lung and airways, it can also damage most other organ systems of the body. It is estimated that about 500,000 lung cancer deaths and 1.6 million COPD deaths can be attributed to air pollution, but air pollution may also account for 19%\u00a0of all cardiovascular deaths and 21%\u00a0of all stroke deaths. Air pollution has been linked to other malignancies, such as bladder cancer and childhood leukemia. Lung development in childhood is stymied with exposure to air pollutants, and poor lung development in children predicts lung impairment in adults. Air pollution is associated with reduced cognitive function and increased risk of dementia. Particulate matter in the air (particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter\u00a0< 2.5 \u03bcm) is associated with delayed psychomotor development and lower child intelligence. Studies link air pollution with diabetes mellitus prevalence, morbidity, and mortality. Pollution affects the immune system and is associated with allergic rhinitis, allergic sensitization, and autoimmunity. It is also associated with osteoporosis and bone fractures, conjunctivitis, dry eye disease, blepharitis, inflammatory bowel disease, increased intravascular coagulation, and decreased glomerular filtration rate. Atopic and urticarial skin disease, acne, and skin aging are linked to air pollution. Air pollution is controllable and, therefore, many of these adverse health effects can be prevented.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to transform the clinical practice of radiology. This study investigated Canadian medical students' perceptions of the impact of AI on radiology, and their influence on the students' preference for radiology specialty.\nIn March 2018, an anonymous online survey was distributed to students at all 17 Canadian medical schools.\nAmong 322 respondents, 70 students considered radiology as the top specialty choice, and 133 as among the top three choices. Only a minority (29.3%) of respondents agreed AI would replace radiologists in foreseeable future, but a majority (67.7%) agreed AI would reduce the demand for radiologists. Even among first-choice respondents, 48.6% agreed AI caused anxiety when considering the radiology specialty. Furthermore, one-sixth of respondents who would otherwise rank radiology as the first choice would not consider radiology because of the anxiety about AI. Prior significant exposure to radiology and high confidence in understanding of AI were shown to decrease the anxiety level. Interested students valued the opinions of local radiologists, radiology conferences, and journals. Students were most interested in \"expert opinions on AI\" and \"discussing AI in preclinical radiology lectures\" to understand the impact of AI.\nAnxiety related to \"displacement\" (not \"replacement\") of radiologists by AI discouraged many medical students from considering the radiology specialty. The radiology community should educate medical students about the potential impact of AI, to ensure radiology is perceived as a viable long-term career choice.", "Crowd sensing is a perception mode that recruits mobile device users to complete tasks such as data collection and cloud computing. For the cloud computing platform, crowd sensing can not only enable users to collaborate to complete large-scale awareness tasks but also provide users for types, social attributes, and other information for the cloud platform. In order to improve the effectiveness of crowd sensing, many incentive mechanisms have been proposed. Common incentives are monetary reward, entertainment &amp; gamification, social relation, and virtual credit. However, there are rare incentives based on privacy protection basically. In this paper, we proposed a mixed incentive mechanism which combined privacy protection and virtual credit called a blockchain-based location privacy protection incentive mechanism in crowd sensing networks. Its network structure can be divided into three parts which are intelligence crowd sensing networks, confusion mechanism, and blockchain. We conducted the experiments in the campus environment and the results shows that the incentive mechanism proposed in this paper has the efficacious effect in stimulating user participation.", "Driver cognitive distraction is a critical factor in road safety, and its evaluation, especially under real conditions, presents challenges to researchers and engineers. In this study, we considered mental workload from a secondary task as a potential source of cognitive distraction and aimed to estimate the increased cognitive load on the driver with a four-channel near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) device by introducing a machine-learning method for hemodynamic data. To produce added cognitive workload in a driver beyond just driving, two levels of an auditory presentation n-back task were used. A total of 60 experimental data sets from the NIRS device during two driving tasks were obtained and analyzed by machine-learning algorithms. We used two techniques to prevent overfitting of the classification models: (1) k-fold cross-validation and principal-component analysis, and (2) retaining 25% of the data (testing data) for testing of the model after classification. Six types of classifier were trained and tested: decision tree, discriminant analysis, logistic regression, the support vector machine, the nearest neighbor classifier, and the ensemble classifier. Cognitive workload levels were well classified from the NIRS data in the cases of subject-dependent classification (the accuracy of classification increased from 81.30 to 95.40%, and the accuracy of prediction of the testing data was 82.18 to 96.08%), subject 26 independent classification (the accuracy of classification increased from 84.90 to 89.50%, and the accuracy of prediction of the testing data increased from 84.08 to 89.91%), and channel-independent classification (classification 82.90%, prediction 82.74%). NIRS data in conjunction with an artificial intelligence method can therefore be used to classify mental workload as a source of potential cognitive distraction in real time under naturalistic conditions; this information may be utilized in driver assistance systems to prevent road accidents.", "In spite of its importance for education, the relationship between learning behaviors (LB), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder symptoms (ADHD) and executive functioning (EF) in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has hardly been explored. The first objective of the present study was to compare children with ASD without intellectual disability and children with typical development (TD) on ADHD symptoms and learning behaviors: Motivation/competence, attitude toward learning, persistence on the task, and strategy/flexibility. The second objective was to analyze the mediator role of behavioral regulation and metacognition components of EF between ADHD symptoms and learning behaviors in children with ASD. Participants were 89 children between 7 and 11 years old, 52 with ASD and 37 with TD, matched on age and intelligence. Their teachers filled out questionnaires assessing executive functioning as well as learning behaviors. Parents and teachers reported on inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity behaviors. Compared to children with TD, children with ASD presented significantly more ADHD symptoms and poorer learning behaviors. In addition, there were significant mediation effects of the behavioral regulation index (BRI) and metacognition index (MI) of EF, indicating that both are part of the route through which ADHD symptoms impact to learning behaviors of children with ASD.", "The biological feedback-based stability (balance) training is used for the rehabilitation of the patients following replacement arthroplasty of the lower extremities with the purpose of restoration of their postural balance.\nThe objective of the present study was to develop a differential algorithm for the prescription of the stability training to the patients after they had undergone the endoprosthetic replacement of the joints of the lower extremities.\nThe study included 48 patients presenting with the following nosological forms: hip arthrosis with total replacement arthroplasty and gonarthrosis with total replacement arthroplasty. All the patients underwent the biofeedback-based stability training with the use of the dynamic balance Pro-Kin system ('Technobody', Italy) using the 'Skiing' No. 10 computer game during 20 minutes every day. The clinical and instrumental methods were employed for the purpose.\nThe rehabilitation subgroups of the patients who had undergone the were distinguished for the first time based on the identification of the main risk factors. It was shown that the main factors having the most pronounced influence on the recovery of postural balance under the conditions of stability training with biological feedback include the age, the time after surgery, the results of evaluation using the Spielberger-Hanin anxiety scale and the Bek depression scale, the level of co-morbidity, the risk of falling estimated from the Morse-Fall scale, and the results of the digit-symbol test based on the Wegsler intelligence scale.\nThe distinguishing between rehabilitation subgroups allowed to develop the differentiated algorithm for the prescription of the stability training with biological feedback for the purpose of restoration of the patients' postural balance following total replacement arthroplasty of the lower extremities.\n\u041e\u0431\u043e\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435. \u0421\u0442\u0430\u0431\u0438\u043b\u043e\u0442\u0440\u0435\u043d\u0438\u043d\u0433 \u0441

trials. CEA plays a key role in many large clinical trials with the aim of achieving consistency and accuracy of the study results, by applying independent and blinded evaluation of suspected clinical events reported by investigators. However, due to high costs there are different opinions regarding the use of central adjudication versus more simplified strategies or site-based assessments and whether the final results differ significantly. There is a lack of scientific evaluation of different adjudication strategies, and more knowledge is needed on the optimal adjudication process and how to achieve the best cost-effectiveness. New methodologies using national registry data and artificial intelligence may challenge the traditional adjudication strategy and could potentially reduce cost considerably with a similar result. Further research and evidence in this field of clinical trials methodology are essential.", "This study reports the results from a 5-year longitudinal investigation of the prevalence and severity of cognitive deficits following significant (i.e., ventilation required for\u200a>\u200a24 hours) traumatic brain injury. The changes in performance, either improvement or decline, across five domains of cognitive functioning are described.\nA group of 56 adults was assessed at approximately 6 months, 1 year, and 5 years following injury.\nImpairment was evident on all measures but prevalence and rate of improvement varied. Overall, by 5 years post-injury over 85% of patients were not impaired on measures of general intelligence, simple attention, and visual perception. However, 28% of patients continued to show some degree of impairment on complex attention and verbal fluency, and performance on verbal memory remained impaired for 60% of patients. There was also evidence for deterioration in complex attention and verbal memory between 1 year and 5 years. ANOVAs showed that improvement occurred on most measures between 6 months and 1 year, but there was both improvement and decline on some measures between 1 year and 5 years.\nThe findings show that there is considerable heterogeneity in cognitive outcome following TBI, with some deterioration evident over the long term.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) neural networks rapidly convert disparate facts and data into highly predictive analytic models.

Data science and computer science will jointly potentiate the impact of AI applications for medical imaging.", "Bullying behavior alters the way in which students coexist together in the classroom and negatively affects adolescents' well-being. Research highlights the importance of emotional skills in promoting positive youth development and optimal social functioning. Therefore, education in these skills is a potential target for interventions aimed at reducing cyberbullying and promoting satisfaction with life during adolescence. This study analyzes the impact of an emotion education program in adolescents to promote classroom coexistence and well-being. The sample comprised 148 students from 7th and 8th grade of secondary school aged between 12 and 15 years (M age = 12.63, SD age = 0.74; 57% girls). A quasi-experimental design with longitudinal data collection was used in this study with randomized classroom assignment to the experimental group and the control group. The intervention program was based on the emotional intelligence model of Mayer and Salovey (1997). Its objective was to develop adolescents' emotional skills to improve the quality of interpersonal relationships and reduce conflicts between peers, positively influencing coexistence and well-being. The intervention took place in eleven sessions during school hours over a period of 3 months. Participants completed the emotional competence questionnaire, the cyberbullying scale and the life satisfaction scale before (T1), immediately after (T2), and 6 months after the intervention (T3). The results showed that the intervention program reduced victimization and assault via mobile phones and the Internet in T2 and T3. In the follow-up (T3), the intervention group had enhanced emotional perception and regulation skills and reported an increase in life satisfaction in comparison to the control group. Our findings suggest that implementing classroom intervention programs to develop students' emotional competencies could be beneficial for their subjective well-being and peer coexistence.", "Conventional electrical circuits are generally rigid in their components and working styles, which are not flexible and stretchable. As an alternative, liquid-metal-based soft electronics offer important opportunities for innovation in modern bioelectronics and electrical engineering. However, their operation in wet environments such as aqueous solution, biological tissue or allied subjects still encounters many technical challenges. Here, we propose a new conceptual electrical circuit, termed as droplet circuit, to fulfill the special needs described above. Such unconventional circuits are immersed in a solution and composed of liquid metal droplets, conductive ions or wires, such as carbon nanotubes. With specifically-designed topological or directional structures/patterns, the liquid-metal droplets composing the circuit can be discrete and disconnected from each other, while achieving the function of electron transport through conductive routes or the quantum tunneling effect. The conductive wires serve as electron transfer stations when the distance between two separate liquid-metal droplets is far beyond that which quantum tunneling effects can support. The unique advantage of the current droplet circuit lies in the fact that it allows parallel electron transport, high flexibility, self-healing, regulation and multi-point connectivity without needing to worry about the circuit break. This would extend the category of classical electrical circuits into newly emerging areas like realizing room temperature quantum computing, making brain-like intelligence or nerve\u207bmachine interface electronics, etc. The mechanisms and potential scientific issues of the droplet circuits are interpreted and future prospects in this direction are outlined.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning have promised to revolutionize the way we live and work, and one of the particularly promising areas for AI is image analysis. Nevertheless, many current AI applications focus on the post-processing of data, while in both materials sciences and medicine, it is often critical to respond to the data acquired on the fly. Here we demonstrate an artificial intelligence atomic force microscope (AI-AFM) that is capable of not only pattern recognition and feature identification in ferroelectric materials and electrochemical systems, but can also respond to classification via adaptive experimentation with additional probing at critical domain walls and grain boundaries, all in real time on the fly without human interference. Key to our success is a highly efficient machine learning strategy based on a support vector machine (SVM) algorithm capable of high fidelity pixel-by-pixel recognition instead of relying on the data from full mapping, making real time classification and control possible during scanning, with which complex electromechanical couplings at the nanoscale in different material systems can be resolved by AI. For AFM experiments that are often tedious, elusive, and heavily rely on human insight for execution and analysis, this is a major disruption in methodology, and we believe that such a strategy empowered by machine learning is applicable to a wide range of instrumentations and broader physical machineries.", "Operationalized Psychodynamic Diagnosis - Structure Questionnaire (OPD-SQ) in Youth: First Results on Reliability and Validity The OPD structure axis questionnaire (OPD-SQ) demonstrated good empirical findings and usability in therapeutic work. Therefore, the aim of this study was to verify the OPD-SQ for an adolescent sample in order to further implement the questionnaire as an economic instrument in clinical childhood and adolescence psychiatry routine. The overall sample consisted of 180 adolescent inpatients (72.8 % female) and 152 pupils (57.9 % female). In order to test reliability, Cronbach's alpha and discriminatory power were assessed. To test validity, YSR11-18 data was collected for the overall sample, and further data (AIDA, LoPF Q12-18, SKID-II, WISC-IV) was collected for the inpatient-sample. Cronbach's alpha was satisfactory for overall OPD-SQ, and all dimensions and sub-dimensions. The differences in mean values between inpatients and pupils were as expected. When controlled for overall symptom severity, gender differences lost significance. Adolescents with one or more SCID-II diagnoses had significantly lower psychic structure. Both construct-related questionnaires (AIDA, LoPF Q12-18) correlated high with OPD-SQ, no correlations were found for psychic structure and intelligence. OPD-SQ proved to be well applicable for the use on adolescents and can be implemented as an economic instrument for the measure of psychic structure in clinical adolescent psychiatry routine.\nZusammenfassung Ausgehend von den guten empirischen Befunden und der Einsetzbarkeit des OPD-Strukturfragebogens (OPD-SF) war es Ziel dieser Studie zu pr\u00fcfen, ob der OPD-SF auch auf eine jugendliche Stichprobe valide anwendbar ist. Die Gesamtstichprobe (n = 332) besteht aus 180 station\u00e4ren jugendlichen Patient/innen (72,8 % weiblich) und 152 Sch\u00fcler/innen (57,9 % weiblich). Zur Reliabilit\u00e4tspr\u00fcfung werden f\u00fcr die Skalen des OPD-SF und seiner Subdimensionen Cronbachs Alphas und Trennsch\u00e4rfeindizes berechnet. Zur Pr\u00fcfung der Validit\u00e4t kam zus\u00e4tzlich der YSR11-18R in der Gesamtstichprobe zum Einsatz. F\u00fcr die klinische Stichprobe liegen weitere Daten (AIDA, LoPF Q12-18, SKID II, WISC-IV) vor, die neben Alter und Geschlecht in die Validierungspr\u00fcfungen einbezogen werden. Itemtrennsch\u00e4rfe sowie Cronbachs Alphas liegen sowohl beim Gesamtwert des OPD-SF sowie bei allen Dimensionen und Subdimension in einem zufriedenstellenden Bereich. Es zeigen sich deutliche Unterschiede zwischen Schul- und klinischer Stichprobe in erwarteten Richtungen. Die Geschlechtsdifferenzen verlieren ihre Signifikanz, wenn f\u00fcr den Gesamtbeschwerdedruck kontrolliert wird. Jugendliche, die mindestens eine SKID-II Diagnose erf\u00fcllen, zeigen deutlich h\u00f6here Werte im OPD-SF. Weiter ergeben sich hohe korrelative Zusammenh\u00e4nge zwischen dem OPD-SF und den zwei konstruktnahen Frageb\u00f6gen, zur Intelligenz zeigten sich keine Zusammenh\u00e4nge. Reliabilit\u00e4ts- und Validit\u00e4tspr\u00fcfung konnten zeigen, dass der OPD-SF auch bei Jugendlichen ein \u00f6konomisches und valides Instrument zur Diagnostik in der klinische Routine darstellt.", "We have developed a real-time system for inhome activity monitoring which could be used to assist the independent living of elders. Our system is a context-aware, and unobtrusive floor-based sensor, which recognizes persons walking or falling, monitors their moving activities and stores the data for regular functional assessment. Here we report an in-depth analysis of the waveform generated by the sensors. We studied the analog characteristics of the signals such as power spectrum, pulse width, number of peeks, and signal shape. Then, we used the Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficient to extract features which later were utilized in the classification process. We have evaluated the performance of our technique using the dataset collected from 10 subjects who performed walks under different environmental conditions. We were able to use computational features of the generated waveform, by extracting the Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients and using computation intelligence to distinguish different people with an average accuracy of 82%.", "Risk prediction modelling is important to better understand the determinants of the course and outcome of PBC and to inform the risk across the disease continuum in PBC enabling risk-stratified follow-up care and personalised therapy. Current prognostic models in PBC are based on treatment response to ursodeoxycholic acid because of the well-established relationship between alkaline phosphatase on treatment and long-term outcome. In addition, serum alkaline phosphatase correlates with ductular reaction and biliary metaplasia, which are hallmark of biliary injury. Considering the waiting time for treatment failure in high-risk patients is not inconsequential, efforts are focused on bringing forward risk stratification at diagnosis by predicting treatment response at onset. There is a need for better prognostic variables that are central to the disease process. We should take an integrative approach that incorporates multiple layers of information including genetic and environmental influences, host characteristics, clinical data, and molecular alterations for risk assessments. Biomarker discovery has an accelerated pace taking advantage of the emergence of large-scale omics platforms (genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and others) and whole-genome sequencing. In the digital era, applications of artificial intelligence, such as machine learning, can support the computing power required to analyse the vast amount of data produced by omics. The information is then used for the development of personalised risk prediction models that through clinical trials and hopefully industry partnerships can guide risk management strategies. We are facing an unprecedented opportunity for the integration of molecular diagnostics into the clinic, which promotes progress toward the personalised management of patients with PBC.", "This article was migrated. The article was marked as recommended. Introduction: Emotional intelligence (EI) refers to an individual's awareness, management, and use of emotions, which has been shown to correlate with successful leadership. The objective of this study was to facilitate the development of emotionally intelligent leaders amongst the student officers within a chapter of the American Pharmacists Association-Academy of Student Pharmacists. Methods: During the 2012-2015 academic years, the chapter officers (n=27) participated in a leadership development program that included self-assessments, group discussions, reflection activities, and/or individual mentoring sessions based upon the concepts of organizational management, strengths-based leadership, team dysfunction, and continuous professional development. The officers also completed the Emotional Intelligence Appraisal\u00ae at the beginning and end of the program, and a perception survey after completing the program. Results: The officers' initial and final EI scores ranged from 54-100 and 59-100, respectively. In addition, their final mean overall, self-awareness, self-management, and relationship-management scores were higher than their corresponding initial scores ( P < 0.05). Most officers (89-100%) also rated each of their developmental experiences as being either very beneficial or beneficial. Conclusion: The implemented program appears to be an effective method for increasing the EI of student organization officers and provides a model for similar efforts in other health professions settings.", "The current theory implying local, short-range overconnectivity in autism spectrum disorder, contrasting with long-range underconnectivity, is based on heterogeneous results, on limited data involving functional connectivity studies, on heterogeneous paediatric populations and non-specific methodologies. In this work, we studied short-distance structural connectivity in a homogeneous population of males with high-functioning autism spectrum disorder and used a novel methodology specifically suited for assessing U-shaped short-distance tracts, including a recently developed tractography-based atlas of the superficial white matter fibres. We acquired diffusion-weighted MRI for 58 males (27 subjects with high-functioning autism spectrum disorder and 31 control subjects) and extracted the mean generalized fractional anisotropy of 63 short-distance tracts. Neuropsychological evaluation included Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale IV (WAIS-IV), Communication Checklist-Adult, Empathy Quotient, Social Responsiveness Scale and Behaviour Rating Inventory of Executive Function-Adult (BRIEF-A). In contradiction with the models of short-range over-connectivity in autism spectrum disorder, we found that patients with autism spectrum disorder had a significantly decreased anatomical connectivity in a component comprising 13 short tracts compared to controls. Specific short-tract atypicalities in temporal lobe and insula were significantly associated with clinical manifestations of autism spectrum disorder such as social awareness, language structure, pragmatic skills and empathy, emphasizing their importance in social dysfunction. Short-range decreased anatomical connectivity may thus be an important substrate of social deficits in autism spectrum disorder, in contrast with current models.", "The Smart Home designed to extend older adults independence is emerging as a clinical solution to the growing ageing population. Nurses will and should play a key role in the development and application of Smart Home technology. Accordingly, conceptual frameworks are needed for nurse scientists who are collaborating with multidisciplinary research teams in developing an intelligent Smart Home that assists with managing older adults' health. We present a conceptual framework that is grounded in critical realism and pragmatism, informing a unique mixed methodological approach to generating, analyzing, and contextualizing sensor data for clinician-based machine learning. This framework can guide nurse scientists in knowledge construction as they participate in multidisciplinary health-assistive Smart Home and artificial intelligence research. In this paper, we review philosophical underpinnings and explicate how this framework can guide nurse scientists collaborating with engineers to develop intelligent health-assistive Smart Homes. It is critical that clinical nursing knowledge is integrated into Smart Home and artificial intelligence features. A conceptual framework and practical method will provide needed structure for knowledge construction by nurse scientists.", "Schizophrenia is associated with alterations in cortical structures and cognitive impairments, but antipsychotic medication may affect these measures. We investigated patterns of relationships between cortical structures and cognitive domains in antipsychotic-na\u00efve patients with first-episode schizophrenia.\nT1-weighted 3T magnetic resonance imaging was performed in 105 patients and 136 healthy control subjects. Using FreeSurfer, we obtained measurements of cortical thickness, surface area, and mean curvature. Using an extensive neurocognitive battery including the Danish Adult Reading Test and subtests from the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery, we obtained estimates of premorbid intelligence, spatial working memory, spatial planning, intra-extradimensional set shifting, and reaction and movement times. With univariate analyses, we tested group differences between cortical structures and cognition. With partial least squares correlation analyses, we investigated patterns of associations between cortical structures and cognition.\nPatients had significantly higher mean curvature and were impaired on 7 of 11 cognitive parameters. The between-group partial least squares correlation analysis revealed two cortical thickness/cognition patterns that differentiated patients and healthy control subjects (omnibus test, p\u00a0= .011). Most cortical regions contributed reliably to these patterns. In patients, spatial working memory, spatial planning, reaction and movement times, and premorbid intelligence contributed reliably to the pattern; in healthy control subjects, spatial planning and intra-extradimensional set shifting contributed reliably.\nAntipsychotic-na\u00efve patients with first-episode schizophrenia displayed a higher mean curvature, but no significant difference in other gray matter indices was found. Nevertheless, the pattern of associations between global cortical thickness and cognitive functions was markedly different between groups. These multivariate analyses reveal a novel linkage between regional cortical brain structure and cognitive deficits at the earliest, never-medicated illness stage.", "In 2008, we launched a new outpatient clinic and day care service designed exclusively for adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Since then, more than 6000 people visited our facility. We have also launched the Medical Institute for Developmental Disabilities Research (MIDDR) at Showa University, where neuroimaging studies with a 3.0 Tesla MRI scanner and rehabilitation studies intended to support people with ASD for job seeking were conducted for the past five years. As our subjects were found to have normal or high intelligence, we present here our research studies on Asperger syndrome patients with the focus on their resting-state functional connectivity network. We also review hypotheses of brain functioning in Asperger syndrome.", "Reading disability is termed \"dyslexia\" if it is much lower than other cognitive abilities according to the intelligence quotient (IQ). This means that dyslexia is caused by an impairment of abilities other than those which the IQ requires. Therefore, reading performance should improve immediately if these impairments are either eliminated or compensated.\nThe experiments explore conditions under which these impairments are compensated and dyslexic children's poor reading ability immediately improve.\nExperiment 1 examined if reducing the number of letters in pseudowords, prolonging the time interval during which the gaze is directed to pseudowords, reducing the amplitude of saccades and prolonging the time interval that elapsed between the beginning of the presentation of a pseudoword and the beginning of the pronunciation of that word influences childrens' reading performance. A group of 100 German children (71 boys and 29 girls) aged 8 to 13 years, who suffered from dyslexia according to the Zuerich Reading Test, were divided into a training group (n\u200a=\u200a50) and an age-matched control group (n\u200a=\u200a50) and tested. Both groups participated in experiment 1. Only the children in the training group participated in experiment 2, in which the children learned a compensatory reading strategy. The age - matched control group did not learn the compensatory reading strategy. In the training group, reading performance was tested before and after having learned the new reading strategy.\nConditions were found under which all children were able to read 95% of the pseudowords correctly. After having learned a compensatory reading strategy, a mean 58.9% decrease in words read incorrectly was found after a single training session. The difference between the number of reading mistakes before and after the training session was highly significant (Wicoxon Test: p\u200a< \u200a0.00001). The effect size showed that the compensatory reading strategy was highly effective (Hedges g\u200a=\u200a1.7). The reading ability of an age-matched dyslexic control group showed no improvement.\nDyslexic subjects' reading performance improves significantly when they learn a new reading strategy.", "Compassionate care is fundamental to nursing. However, when delivering compassionate care, the expected emotional state may not always spontaneously arise, risking a dissonance between authentic and displayed emotions. Nurses may therefore be required to engage in some form of emotional regulation strategy, to conform with assumed professional rules on emotional display. In both the dissonance and emotional regulation, there are risks on which nurses need to reflect. In this article, the end of the Trojan War as depicted in Homer's The Iliad and Virgil's The Aeneid is used as an allegory to illustrate the dangers and advantages of using response- or antecedent-focused strategies for emotional regulation. Response-focused strategies are reactive in nature-they could build resilience over time but may leave students and newly qualified nurses feeling exposed. An 'emotional curriculum' to include emotional intelligence in nurse education could equip the students with a more proactive approach to developing resilience rather than defensive practice. Using a narrative as an allegory may help to explore the application of these concepts in nursing practice.", "The present study has two objectives: first, to analyze whether the dimensions that make up emotional intelligence (attention, clarity, and repair) give rise to different profiles of university students, and secondly, to determine whether these different profiles are differentially associated with the parenting practices that students report with regard to their fathers and mothers. Results obtained indicate the existence of different profiles of college students. The profile that corresponds to adequate emotional skills presents a lower score in attention, but higher scores in clarity, and especially in mood repair. The other two profiles are inadequate, in the first case because a higher score in emotional attention is accompanied by low scores in mood repair, and in the second case because low scores are presented in all three dimensions. Likewise, we verified the existence of significant differences in the educational practices of parents, the adequate profile is characterized by greater use of parenting dimensions considered to be positive, and at the same time, lower scores on dimensions considered to be negative. One of the dysfunctional profiles is associated with higher scores in positive practices, and is also associated with higher scores in practices considered to produce a negative effect. The second dysfunctional profile is associated with higher scores on the dimensions considered to be negative and lower scores on positive dimensions.", "Refractory epilepsy is a common and troublesome neurosurgical disease. This study is designed to compare seizure control and degrees in intellectual outcome in children with refractory epilepsy after surgical treatment.\n20 children with refractory epilepsy were treated with tailored epilepsy surgery or vagus nerve stimulation (VNS). We used the Engel Epilepsy Surgery Outcome Scale to evaluate seizure control and the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, fourth edition (WISC-IV), to test the children's intellectual outcomes 7-day preoperative and 3-, 6-, and 12-month postoperative.\nIn total, 14 cases were seizure free (Engel I) and 2 cases to have suffered few attacks since surgery (Engel II). In two cases, the frequency of seizures decreased by >90% (Engel III). In the remaining two cases, the effects of surgery on seizure control were not obvious (Engel IV). All children completed the WISC-IV test. On average, postoperative intelligence quotient (IQ) increased by 6.35 points 12-month postsurgery compared with the results of the preoperative tests (P < 0.01). Second, intellectual outcomes after surgery in the Engel I and II groups increased by >3.88 points compared with in the Engel III and IV groups (P < 0.05). Finally, there were no fatal complications over the long-term follow-up except for intracranial infection of two cases; postoperative subcutaneous hematoma occurred in one case and hoarseness in one case.\nIndividualized epilepsy surgery is safe and effective for children with refractory epilepsy. It can control or reduce the frequency of postoperative attacks as well as improve postoperative intellectual outcomes to different degrees.", "Deep neural networks (DNNs) are the major drivers of recent progress in artificial intelligence. They have emerged as the machine-learning method of choice in solving image and speech recognition problems, and their potential has raised the expectation of similar breakthroughs in other fields of study. In this work, we compared three machine-learning methods-DNN, random forest (a popular conventional method), and variable nearest neighbor (arguably the simplest method)-in their ability to predict the molecular activities of 21 in vivo and in vitro data sets. Surprisingly, the overall performance of the three methods was similar. For molecules with structurally close near neighbors in the training sets, all methods gave reliable predictions, whereas for molecules increasingly dissimilar to the training molecules, all three methods gave progressively poorer predictions. For molecules sharing little to no structural similarity with the training molecules, all three methods gave a nearly constant value-approximately the average activity of all training molecules-as their predictions. The results confirm conclusions deduced from analyzing molecular applicability domains for accurate predictions, i.e., the most important determinant of the accuracy of predicting a molecule is its similarity to the training samples. This highlights the fact that even in the age of deep learning, developing a truly high-quality model relies less on the choice of machine-learning approach and more on the availability of experimental efforts to generate sufficient training data of structurally diverse compounds. The results also indicate that the distance to training molecules offers a natural and intuitive basis for defining applicability domains to flag reliable and unreliable quantitative structure-activity relationship predictions.", "The genetic correlates of extreme impulsive violence are poorly understood, and there have been no studies that have systematically characterized a large group of affected individuals both clinically and genetically. We performed a genome-wide rare copy number variant (CNV) analysis in 281 males from four Czech prisons who met strict clinical criteria for extreme impulsive violence. Inclusion criteria included age\u2009\u2265\u200918\u2009years, an ICD-10 diagnosis of Dissocial Personality Disorder, and the absence of an organic brain disorder. Participants underwent a structured psychiatric assessment to diagnose extreme impulsive violence and then provided a blood sample for genetic analysis. DNA was genotyped and CNVs were identified using Illumina HumanOmni2.5 single-nucleotide polymorphism array platform. Comparing with 10851 external population controls, we identified 828 rare CNVs (frequency\u2009\u2264\u20090.1% among control samples) in 264 participants. The CNVs impacted 754 genes, with 124 genes impacted more than once (2-25 times). Many of these genes are associated with autosomal dominant or X-linked disorders affecting adult behavior, cognition, learning, intelligence, specifically expressed in the brain and relevant to synapses, neurodevelopment, neurodegeneration, obesity and neuropsychiatric phenotypes. Specifically, we identified 31 CNVs of clinical relevance in 31 individuals, 59 likely clinically relevant CNVs in 49 individuals, and 17 recurrent CNVs in 65 individuals. Thus, 123 of 281 (44%) individuals had one to several rare CNVs that were indirectly or directly relevant to impulsive violence. Extreme impulsive violence is genetically heterogeneous and genomic analysis is likely required to identify, further research and specifically treat the causes in affected individuals.", "Externalizing problems (EP), including rule-breaking, aggression, and criminal involvement, are highly prevalent during adolescence, but the adult outcomes of adolescents exhibiting EP are characterized by heterogeneity. Although many youths' EP subside after adolescence, others' persists into adulthood. Characterizing the development of severe EP is essential to prevention and intervention efforts. Multiple predictors of adult antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) and legal outcomes of a large sample (N = 1205) of clinically- or legally-ascertained adolescents (ages 12-19 years) with severe EP were examined. Many psychosocial predictors hypothesized to predict persistence of EP demonstrated zero-order associations with adult outcomes, but accounted for little unique variation after accounting for baseline conduct disorder symptoms (CD) and demographic factors. Baseline measures of intelligence, which explained independent variation in legal outcomes, provided the only consistent exception to this pattern, though future work is needed to parse these effects from those of socioeconomic factors. CD severity during adolescence is a parsimonious index of liability for persistence of EP into adulthood that explains outcome variance above and beyond all other demographic and psychosocial predictors in this sample.", "To study the association of prepregnancy body mass index (BMI) and gestational weight gain with child neurodevelopmental outcomes.\nWe performed a secondary analysis of data from two parallel, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled thyroxine replacement trials in pregnant women with either hypothyroxinemia or subclinical hypothyroidism who delivered at term. Body mass index was categorized as normal (18.5-24.9), overweight (25.0-29.9), or obese (30 or greater). We also evaluated early (20 weeks of gestation or less), late (greater than 20 weeks of gestation), and total gestational weight gain and categorized gestational weight gain as inadequate, adequate, and excessive per 2009 Institute of Medicine guidelines. Neurodevelopmental outcomes included 5-year Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence and 3-year Differential Ability Scales-II. Linear and logistic regression analyses were performed and adjusted for maternal age, race-ethnicity, education, insurance status, parity, smoking and alcohol use, thyroid status (subclinical hypothyroidism or hypothyroxinemia), treatment group, gestational age at delivery, and neonatal sex.\nOf the 948 women included, 380 (40%), 305 (32%), and 263 (28%) had normal, overweight, and obese prepregnancy BMI, respectively. A total of 106 (11%), 212 (22%), and 630 (66%) of women had inadequate, adequate, and excessive total rates of gestational weight gain, respectively. Maternal differences among the BMI categories included race-ethnicity, education, insurance type, parity, and thyroid status (all P<.01), whereas the gestational weight gain groups only differed by parity (P<.001). In unadjusted analysis, children of obese (93.2\u00b112.8; 88.5\u00b113.3) and overweight (94.1\u00b115.6; 89.6\u00b116.0) women had lower Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence and Differential Ability Scales-II scores, respectively, than normal-weight women (97.4\u00b115.4; 93.9\u00b116.0; P<.001 for all comparisons); however, in adjusted analysis, there were no differences in neurodevelopmental outcomes by maternal BMI. The association was primarily accounted for by race-ethnicity and education. In unadjusted and adjusted analyses, there were no differences in neurodevelopmental outcomes by adequacy of early, late, or total gestational weight gain.\nIn women with either subclinical hypothyroidism or hypothyroxinemia, neither prepregnancy BMI nor gestational weight gain was associated with neurodevelopmental outcomes among children born at term in adjusted analyses.", "Higher life expectancy is increasing the number of age-related cognitive impairment cases. It is also relevant, as some authors claim, that physical exercise may be considered as an adjunctive therapy to improve cognition and memory after strokes. Thus, the integration of physical and cognitive therapies could offer potential benefits. In addition, in general these therapies are usually considered boring, so it is important to include some features that improve the motivation of patients. As a result, computer-assisted cognitive rehabilitation systems and serious games for health are more and more present. In order to achieve a continuous, efficient and sustainable rehabilitation of patients, they will have to be carried out as part of the rehabilitation in their own home. However, current home systems lack the therapist's presence, and this leads to two major challenges for such systems. First, they need sensors and actuators that compensate for the absence of the therapist's eyes and hands. Second, the system needs to capture and apply the therapist's expertise. With this aim, and based on our previous proposals, we propose an ambient intelligence environment for cognitive rehabilitation at home, combining physical and cognitive activities, by implementing a Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) that gathers, as far as possible, the knowledge of a rehabilitation expert. Moreover, smart sensors and actuators will attempt to make up for the absence of the therapist. Furthermore, the proposed system will feature a remote monitoring tool, so that the therapist can supervise the patients' exercises. Finally, an evaluation will be presented where experts in the rehabilitation field showed their satisfaction with the proposed system.", "The current review aims to discuss the incorporation of facial recognition software into the clinical practice of dysmorphology and medical genetics.\nFacial recognition software has improved the process of generating a differential diagnosis for rare genetic syndromes, and recent publications demonstrate utility in both research and clinical applications. Software programs are freely available to verified medical providers and can be incorporated into routine clinic encounters.\nAs facial recognition software capabilities improve, two-dimensional image capture with artificial intelligence interpretation may become a useful tool within many areas of medicine. Geneticists and researchers can use such software to enhance their differential diagnoses, to study similarities and differences between patient cohorts, and to improve the interpretation of genomic data. Pediatricians and subspecialists may use tools to identify patients who may benefit from a genetic evaluation, and educators can use these tools to interest students in the study of dysmorphoplogy and genetic syndromes.", "We conducted a meta-analysis of 18 studies to establish whether a relation exists between Reading the Mind in the Eye Test (RMET) performance and intelligence quotient (IQ) in individuals diagnosed with autism-spectrum disorders (ASD) and controls, taking into account relevant characteristics such as age, gender, and autism quotient. Our findings indicate that RMET performance was better in controls compared with those diagnosed with ASD. We found that RMET performance is dependent on full and verbal IQ and age in controls. However, RMET performance is negatively correlated with performance IQ in individuals diagnosed with ASD. These results suggest that the methodology applied by ASD when taking the RMET is different from control individuals and might depend less on verbal abilities.", "Biological and medical diagnoses depend on high-quality measurements. A wearable device based on Internet of Things (IoT) must be unobtrusive to the human body to encourage users to accept continuous monitoring. However, unobtrusive IoT devices are usually of low quality and unreliable because of the limitation of technology progress that has slowed down at high peak. Therefore, advanced inference techniques must be developed to address the limitations of IoT devices. This review proposes that IoT technology in biological and medical applications should be based on a new data assimilation process that fuses multiple data scales from several sources to provide diagnoses. Moreover, the required technologies are ready to support the desired disease diagnosis levels, such as hypothesis test, multiple evidence fusion, machine learning, data assimilation, and systems biology. Furthermore, cross-disciplinary integration has emerged with advancements in IoT. For example, the multiscale modeling of systems biology from proteins and cells to organs integrates current developments in biology, medicine, mathematics, engineering, artificial intelligence, and semiconductor technologies. Based on the monitoring objectives of IoT devices, researchers have gradually developed ambulant, wearable, noninvasive, unobtrusive, low-cost, and pervasive monitoring devices with data assimilation methods that can overcome the limitations of devices in terms of quality measurement. In the future, the novel features of data assimilation in systems biology and ubiquitous sensory development can describe patients' physical conditions based on few but long-term measurements.", "Pho regulon is a highly evolved and conserved mechanism across the microbes to fulfil their phosphate need. In this study, 52 proteobacteria genomes were analyzed for the presence of phosphorus acquisition genes, their pattern of arrangement and copy numbers. The diverse genetic architecture of the Pho regulon genes indicates the evolutionary challenge of nutrient limitation, particularly phosphorus, faced by bacteria in their environment. The incongruence between the Pho regulon proteins phylogeny and species phylogeny along with the presence of additional copies of pstS and pstB genes, having cross similarity with other genera, suggest the possibility of horizontal gene transfer event. The substitution rate analysis and multiple sequence alignment of the Pho regulon proteins were analyzed to gain additional insight into the evolution of the Pho regulon system. This comprehensive study confirms that genes perform the regulatory function (phoBR) were vertically inherited, whereas interestingly, genes whose product involved in direct interaction with the environment (pstS) acquired by horizontal gene transfer. The substantial amino acid substitutions in PstS most likely contribute to the successful adaptation of bacteria in different ecological condition dealing with different phosphorus availability. The findings decipher the intelligence of the bacteria which enable them to carry out the targeted alteration of genes to cope up with the environmental condition.", "As Internet accessibility and technological innovations continue to increase communication, new opportunities have emerged to leverage these tools to improve health promotion practice. Advances and utilization of collaborative Internet communication, or social media, have provided global connectivity on an unprecedented scale. Using these innovations to leverage the collective intellect of online communities for specific goals, crowdsourcing is an approach that has the potential to solve complex public health problems. Due to the novelty of crowdsourcing implementations and the relative infancy of its application within public health, it is necessary to examine examples to facilitate practitioner conceptualization and application. This article details the development and application of a crowdsourced effort leveraging social media and technology to assist in relief efforts during Hurricane Harvey. Furthermore, the article presents examples corresponding to a typology of crowdsourcing for public health, including Knowledge Discovery and Management, Distributed Human Intelligence Tasking, Broadcast Search, and Peer-Vetted Creative Production problems. Leveraging these innovative applications has positive implications for health promotion practice, including improved intervention development and evaluation, increased multidisciplinary collaboration, and enhanced facilitation of communication, information exchange, and support.", "The internet of things is arriving at the laboratory, connecting instruments for remote control and monitoring. Along with Artificial Intelligence Software to analyse data and design experiments, it could fundamentally change the way research is done. [Image: see text]", "To what extent is current clinical practice capable of gathering relevant patient data, observing them and giving them adequate information back? To what extent does the clinical pathway play a role of real care and not simply technology delivery? The neurology clinic is an excellent case study for these questions. Experience shows that the available time is often inadequate to the complexity of the clinical and human cases. In particular, the patterns of clinical history in use ignore the individuality of the patient and his existential dimension. The objective evaluation must be targeted and at the same time must take into account the patient's symbolic expectations. The current practice follows incorrect or inefficient patterns, and is not calibrated for the true recipient, who is the patient. At the current stage of development, it is doubtful that Artificial Intelligence can solve these problems. Rather the opposite.", "Assessing the association between socioeconomic gradient and cognitive development among children of a Spanish birth cohort aged 5-6 years from a gender perspective.\nCognitive development was assessed on 525 children aged 5-6 years in the INMA-Valencia cohort, with the Global Cognitive Score (GCS) from McCarthy Scales of Children's Abilities. Information on social class, education level and employment was collected for both parents in addition to other sociodemographic factors, parental, family and child characteristics. The relationship between maternal and paternal socioeconomic gradient and cognitive development was assessed by linear regressions and comparing the variance explained by each indicator measured in the mother and father.\nMaternal socioeconomic gradient indicators explained more variance on GCS than paternal. Maternal education and paternal social class had an important individual effect that stayed after adjusting by other parental, child and family determinants. In the multivariable analysis, maternal education, age and intelligence, paternal social class and the child's age and sex were significantly associated with cognitive development.\nDiverse socioeconomic gradient factors have an important influence on cognitive development, maternal education being the strongest determinant. Policies should be implemented to mitigate the negative effects of this gradient on child development.", "The purpose of this research was to investigate the relationship between temperament style and understanding of goal-directed action in 10-11-month-old infants. Infant social understanding was assessed using a looking-time measure similar to Woodward (1998). This method yielded two measures of infant social understanding; 'decrement of attention' (a measure of infant attention during habituation) and 'novelty preference' (an index of infants' understanding of goal-directed behavior). Temperament style was provided by online parent report (IBQ; Rothbart, 1981). Infant shy/fearful temperament predicted decrement of attention scores. Novelty preference was also marginally related to shy temperament, but more strongly associated with low intensity pleasure, specifically enjoyment of physical contact with caregivers. Moreover, shy temperament continued to predict infant social understanding even when controlling for the effect of non-social intelligence (ASQ; Squires, et al., 2009). In our study, as in research with preschool-aged children (Wellman et al., 2011; Mink et al., 2014), shy, reticent temperament style is associated with social information processing, providing further evidence for continuity in individual differences in social cognition in early childhood.", "The goal of augmented intelligence is to increase efficiency and effectiveness in practice. To achieve this, augmented intelligence technologies are being asked to perform a range of tasks, from simple to complex and quantitative. The development of these systems is increasingly important as screening becomes more personalized. This article will provide an overview of augmented intelligence in a variety of breast imaging applications.\nThe incorporation of AI and ML techniques in breast imaging provides important new tools that will deliver ways to \"sharpen\" trusted familiar tools (so-called \"augmented intelligence\") to support radiologists, not replace them. The first wave of medical imaging systems based on AI and ML has primarily used ML to fix the values of key imaging parameters to be adapted to the individual as part of personalized medicine. Artificial intelligence is the new tool in the radiologist's arsenal but will never replace the human qualities that are important in medicine-intellectual curiosity, passion, and drive.", "Children with genetic neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) such as Down syndrome, Prader-Willi syndrome, and Fragile X syndrome may show a range of cognitive impairments, including impairments in executive functions (EF). EF are related to general intelligence, academic achievement, and literacy and mathematical skills. EF deficits are linked to a variety of clinically and socially important behaviors. Therefore, methods for improving EF in children with NDDs could be beneficial. One method for improving EF is through cognitive training. Research on commercial brain training programmes and video games suggests that EF can be improved through training, both in healthy adults and in children with NDDs. Computerized cognitive training (CCT) therefore represents a potentially viable intervention for children with NDDs. For training to be effective, it is important that an appropriate regimen is followed. Since children are likely to engage with training at home, the intentions of their parents to support them are therefore important. However, no research has investigated the attitudes of parents of children with NDDs to CCT. To address this, we developed a questionnaire based on the theory of planned behavior, which states that a person's intention to engage in a behavior is predicted by (1) their attitude toward the behavior, (2) their perception of subjective norms regarding the behavior (i.e., perceived social pressure), and (3) their perceived control over the behavior. The questionnaire was completed by parents of children with NDDs; 58 unique responses were retained for analyses. Parents reported low levels of knowledge of CCTs, and low levels of experience with CCTs (both their own experience and their child's experience). However, our results also show that parents of children with NDDs have positive beliefs about the potential of CCT to benefit their children and intend to support the use of CCT by their children. Linear modeling showed that, of the three constructs of the theory of planned behavior, only attitudes significantly predicted intention. Finally, parents' beliefs about the benefits of CCT correlated positively with positive attitudes toward such training. We also found limited evidence that parents of boys have more positive attitudes regarding CCT than parents of girls.", "Good sleep hygiene practices, including consistent bedtimes and 7-9\u00a0h of sleep/night, are theorized to benefit educational learning. However, individuals differ in how much sleep they need, as well as in their chronotype preference. Therefore, some students may be more vulnerable to the cognitive effects of sleep loss, later bedtimes and nonpreferred times of learning than others. One prominent example is the debate regarding whether sleep loss and later bedtimes affect classroom learning more in female or male students. To inform this gender-and-sleep-loss debate, we developed a virtual college-level lecture to use in a controlled, laboratory setting. During Session 1, 78 undergraduate students were randomly assigned to take the lecture at 12:00 (noon condition) or 19:30 (evening condition). Then participants wore wristband actigraphy for 1\u00a0week to monitor average and intraindividual variability in sleep duration, bedtime and midpoint of sleep. During Session 2, participants completed a test at the same time of day as Session 1. The test included basic questions that were similar to trained concepts during the lecture (trained items) as well as integration questions that required application of learned concepts (knowledge-transfer items). Bayesian analyses supported the null hypothesis that time of learning did not affect test performance. Collapsed across time of testing, regression analyses showed that shorter sleep durations and later bedtimes explained 13% of the variance in test performance. Longer sleep durations and earlier bedtimes predicted better test performance primarily in females, younger students and morning-types. Interestingly, students with above-median fluid intelligence scores were resilient to short sleep and late bedtimes. Our findings indicate that both sleep and circadian factors should be addressed to optimize educational learning, particularly in the students who are most susceptible to sleep loss.", "A robust relationship between working memory (WM) and general intelligence (g) has been well established. Nevertheless, explanations for this relationship in terms of underlying neurocognitive processes are still inadequate. This study addresses this issue using an individual differences approach in which Central Executive System (CES) and Short-Term Storage (STS) components of WM are measured comprehensively and examined for their relationship with g via event-related potentials components (P200 and P300) as mediators. Participants (n\u2009=\u2009115) completed tests of the WM, CES and STS, as well as g. P200 and P300 components were recorded during 3-back WM task performance. Structural equation modelling showed significant negative associations between the P200 latency for target stimuli and CES shifting processes, and between the P300 amplitude for target stimuli and CES inhibition and updating processes. The relationship between CES processes and g was mediated in a localized fashion by the P300 amplitude. These findings further support the notion that the CES has a multidimensional structure and, importantly, reveal that the inhibition and updating functions of the CES are crucial in explaining the relationship between WM and g. Negative relations between ERP indices (P200 latency and P300 amplitude for target stimuli) and g support a neural efficiency hypothesis related to high intelligence.", "This article was migrated. The article was marked as recommended. Machine learning approaches form the basis of \"artificial intelligence\" and have been increasingly applied in health services settings. It has been shown that such approaches may produce more accurate predictions in some contexts, compared to conventional statistical approaches, and may also reduce the costs of decision-making through automation.\u00a0 Nevertheless, there are both general limitations to developing and implementing machine learning approaches that must be borne in mind. To date, relatively little research has been published on the potential for machine learning to support personnel selection. Moreover, there are particular challenges and issues that need to be considered if such methods are to be used to support decision-making in medical selection scenarios. This article describes some of these potential advantages and challenges and presents an illustrative example, based on real-world data, related to the selection of medical undergraduates.", "Batch normalization (BN) has recently become a standard component for accelerating and improving the training of deep neural networks (DNNs). However, BN brings in additional calculations, consumes more memory, and significantly slows down the training iteration. Furthermore, the nonlinear square and sqrt operations in the normalization process impede low bit-width quantization techniques, which draw much attention to the deep learning hardware community. In this paper, we propose an L1 -norm BN (L1BN) with only linear operations in both forward and backward propagations during training. L1BN is approximately equivalent to the conventional L2 -norm BN (L2BN) by multiplying a scaling factor that equals (\u03c0/2)1/2 . Experiments on various convolutional neural networks and generative adversarial networks reveal that L1BN can maintain the same performance and convergence rate as L2BN but with higher computational efficiency. In real application-specified integrated circuit synthesis with reduced resources, L1BN achieves 25% speedup and 37% energy saving compared to the original L2BN. Our hardware-friendly normalization method not only surpasses L2BN in speed but also simplifies the design of deep learning accelerators. Last but not least, L1BN promises a fully quantized training of DNNs, which empowers future artificial intelligence applications on mobile devices with transfer and continual learning capability.", "As a prevalent metabolic disease, diabetes has different side effects and causes a wide range of co morbidity with a high rate of mortality. There is a need for certain interventions to manage this disease. Iranians usually have three main meals a day. Considering the special needs of diabetic patients and the possibility of hypoglycemia between the main meals, it is essential for these patients to eat something as a snack. Considering these conditions and the society's orientation towards modern technologies such as smart phones, designing mobile-based nutrition recommender systems can be helpful.\nThe snack recommender system is a knowledge-based smart phone application. This study has focused on the development of a recommender system that combines artificial intelligence techniques and makes up a knowledge base according to the guidelines posed by the American Diabetes Association (ADA). The snack menu was recommended in accordance with the patient's favorites and conditions. The accuracy of the recommended menu was assessed in 2 steps. First, it was compared with the diet prescribed by three nutrition specialists. In the second step, system's suggested menu was evaluated by the data from 30 diabetic patients using a valid questionnaire.\nThe results of evaluating the snack recommender system by nutritionists showed that this system is capable of recommending various snacks according to the season (accuracy of 100%) and personal interests (accuracy of 90%) to diabetic patients. According to health nutritionists, the snacks suggested by this system are matched with Iranian culture. Moreover, the results revealed that a higher body mass index (BMI) makes the recommender system less sensitive to personal interests to suggest what is basically beneficial for one's health.\nThis study was a pioneering research to develop a more comprehensive dietary recommender system for diabetic patients which includes main meals as well. Patients found the system useful and were satisfied with the application. This system is believed to be able to help diabetic patients to take more healthy diet which leads to a better lifestyle.", "The evidence for negative influences of maternal stress during pregnancy on child cognition remains inconclusive. This study tested the association between maternal prenatal stress and child intelligence in 4,251 mother-child dyads from a multiethnic population-based cohort in the Netherlands. A latent factor of prenatal stress was constructed, and child IQ was tested at age 6\u00a0years. In Dutch and Caribbean participants, prenatal stress was not associated with child IQ after adjustment for maternal IQ and socioeconomic status. In other ethnicities no association was found; only in the Moroccan/Turkish group a small negative association between prenatal stress and child IQ was observed. These results suggest that prenatal stress does not predict child IQ, except in children from less acculturated minority groups.", "To investigate the association between white matter diffuse excessive high signal intensity (DEHSI) on neonatal magnetic resonance imaging in very preterm infants and neurobehavioral outcomes at the age of 13 years.\nMagnetic resonance images of very preterm children (<30 weeks gestational age or <1250\u2009g birth weight) were evaluated at term-equivalent age with DEHSI classified into 5 grades. Additionally, visibility of the posterior periventricular crossroads was assessed. General intelligence, memory, attention, executive function, motor abilities, and behavior were examined in 125 children at age 13 years and related to DEHSI grades using linear regression.\nDEHSI was detected in 93% of infants; 21% grade 1, 22% grade 2, 32% grade 3, and 18% grade 4. Neurobehavioral outcomes were similar for all DEHSI groups. There was weak evidence that higher DEHSI grades related to higher verbal IQ and attention and that lower DEHSI grades related to better planning ability. Adjustment for gestational age, birth weight standard score, and sex further weakened these effects. Only 12 children had invisible posterior crossroads and showed slightly poorer outcomes at 13 years of age.\nThere was little evidence that neonatal DEHSI serves as a sensitive biomarker for later impairment. Further investigation on the importance of invisible posterior periventricular crossroads in larger samples is needed.", "Healthy aging is associated with decreased neural selectivity (dedifferentiation) in category-selective cortical regions. This finding has prompted the suggestion that dedifferentiation contributes to age-related cognitive decline. Consistent with this possibility, dedifferentiation has been reported to negatively correlate with fluid intelligence in older adults. Here, we examined whether dedifferentiation is associated with performance in another cognitive domain-episodic memory-that is also highly vulnerable to aging. Given the proposed role of dedifferentiation in age-related cognitive decline, we predicted there would be a stronger link between dedifferentiation and episodic memory performance in older than in younger adults. Young (18-30 years) and older (64-75 years) male and female humans underwent fMRI scanning while viewing images of objects and scenes before a subsequent recognition memory test. We computed a differentiation index in two regions of interest (ROIs): parahippocampal place area (PPA) and lateral occipital complex (LOC). This index quantified the selectivity of the BOLD response to preferred versus nonpreferred category of an ROI (scenes for PPA, objects for LOC). The differentiation index in the PPA, but not the LOC, was lower in older than in younger adults. Additionally, the PPA differentiation index predicted recognition memory performance for the studied items. This relationship was independent of and not moderated by age. The PPA differentiation index also predicted performance on a latent \"fluency\" factor derived from a neuropsychological test battery; this relationship was also age invariant. These findings suggest that two independent factors, one associated with age, and the other with cognitive performance, influence neural differentiation.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Aging is associated with neural dedifferentiation-reduced neural selectivity in \"category-selective\" cortical brain regions-which has been proposed to contribute to cognitive aging. Here, we examined whether neural differentiation is predictive of episodic memory performance, and whether the relationship is moderated by age. A neural differentiation index was estimated for scene-selective (PPA) and object-selective (LOC) cortical regions while participants studied images for a subsequent memory test. Age-related reductions were observed for the PPA, but not for the LOC, differentiation index. Importantly, the PPA differentiation index demonstrated age-invariant correlations with subsequent memory performance and a fluency factor derived from a neuropsychological battery. Together, these findings suggest that neural differentiation is associated with two independent factors: age and cognitive performance.", "Omic sciences coupled with novel computational approaches such as machine intelligence offer completely new approaches to major depressive disorder (MDD) research. The complexity of MDD's pathophysiology is being integrated into studies examining MDD's biology within the omic fields. Lipidomics, as a late-comer among other omic fields, is increasingly being recognized in psychiatric research because it has allowed the investigation of global lipid perturbations in patients suffering from MDD and indicated a crucial role of specific patterns of lipid alterations in the development and progression of MDD. Combinatorial lipid-markers with high classification power are being developed in order to assist MDD diagnosis, while rodent models of depression reveal lipidome changes and thereby unveil novel treatment targets for depression. In this systematic review, we provide an overview of current breakthroughs and future trends in the field of lipidomics in MDD research and thereby paving the way for precision medicine in MDD.", "Echocardiography plays a crucial role in the diagnosis and management of cardiovascular disease. However, interpretation remains largely reliant on the subjective expertise of the operator. As a result inter-operator variability and experience can lead to incorrect diagnoses. Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies provide new possibilities for echocardiography to generate accurate, consistent and automated interpretation of echocardiograms, thus potentially reducing the risk of human error. In this review, we discuss a subfield of AI relevant to image interpretation, called machine learning, and its potential to enhance the diagnostic performance of echocardiography. We discuss recent applications of these methods and future directions for AI-assisted interpretation of echocardiograms. The research suggests it is feasible to apply machine learning models to provide rapid, highly accurate and consistent assessment of echocardiograms, comparable to clinicians. These algorithms are capable of accurately quantifying a wide range of features, such as the severity of valvular heart disease or the ischaemic burden in patients with coronary artery disease. However, the applications and their use are still in their infancy within the field of echocardiography. Research to refine methods and validate their use for automation, quantification and diagnosis are in progress. Widespread adoption of robust AI tools in clinical echocardiography practice should follow and have the potential to deliver significant benefits for patient outcome.", "Assessment of intelligence and executive function (EF) is common in complex neuropsychiatric practice. Although previous studies have shown that EF and intelligence are related, it is unknown whether these constructs relate to one another in a similar manner across different ability groups (mild intellectual disability, borderline intellectual disability and normal/high intelligence). This study therefore examines the relation between three EFs (inhibition, shifting and updating) and intelligence in a heterogeneous psychiatric sample. It is hypothesised that the strength of the relation between intelligence and the three EFs decreases when the level of intelligence increases, in accordance with Spearman's Law of Diminishing Returns.\nIn a cross-sectional, between and within subject design, one of the three intelligence tests (Kaufman Adolescent and Adult Intelligence Test and Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale - third and fourth editions) and several EF tests (Stroop Colour-Word Test, Trail Making Test and Spatial Working Memory task) were administered to 250 neuropsychiatric inpatients and outpatients (Mage \u00a0=\u00a039.8, standard deviation\u00a0=\u00a014.3, 52.8% male). Based upon their full-scale IQ score, patients were divided into three ability groups (mild intellectual disability, borderline intellectual disability or normal/high intelligence). The relation between EF and intelligence was assessed through analyses of the correlation pattern; groups were compared using analysis of covariance.\nAnalyses showed significant correlations between the constructs of EF and intelligence. A significant interaction effect was found for shifting, with highest correlations in the normal to high intelligence group, but not for inhibition and updating.\nResults support a specific role for shifting in this EF-intelligence relation. The correlational pattern of updating and intelligence, as well as the differential relation of shifting and intelligence across ability groups, suggests that EF tasks may not measure distinct EFs in lower intellectual ability but rely on cognitive primitives such as processing speed. EF tasks can be considered less valid indicators of EF ability. Implications in terms of the need for development of specific tasks to measure cognition in low intellectual ability are discussed.", "Remarkable advances in biomedical research have led to the generation of large amounts of data. Using artificial intelligence, it has become possible to extract meaningful information from large volumes of data, in a shorter frame of time, with very less human interference. In effect, convolutional neural networks (a deep learning method) have been taught to recognize pathological lesions from images. Diabetes has high morbidity, with millions of people who need to be screened for diabetic retinopathy (DR). Deep neural networks offer a great advantage of screening for DR from retinal images, in improved identification of DR lesions and risk factors for diseases, with high accuracy and reliability. This review aims to compare the current evidences on various deep learning models for diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy (DR).\n\u6458\u8981: \u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u663e\u8457\u8fdb\u6b65\u5df2\u7ecf\u8fdb\u5165\u5927\u6570\u636e\u65f6\u4ee3\u3002\u5229\u7528\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u4f7f\u5728\u66f4\u77ed\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u3001\u4eba\u5de5\u5e72\u9884\u66f4\u5c11\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4ece\u5927\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u6210\u4e3a\u53ef\u80fd\u3002\u5b9e\u9645\u4e0a, \u8111\u56de\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc(\u4e00\u79cd\u6df1\u5165\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u5f0f)\u5df2\u7ecf\u53ef\u4ee5\u4ece\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u8bc6\u522b\u75c5\u7406\u75c5\u53d8\u3002\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u7684\u53d1\u75c5\u7387\u5f88\u9ad8, \u6210\u5343\u4e0a\u4e07\u7684\u4eba\u9700\u8981\u8fdb\u884c\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u89c6\u7f51\u819c\u75c5\u53d8(DR)\u7b5b\u67e5\u3002\u6df1\u5c42\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u89c6\u7f51\u819c\u56fe\u50cf\u7b5b\u67e5DR\u4e2d\u5448\u73b0\u660e\u663e\u4f18\u52bf, \u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8bc6\u522bDR\u75c5\u7076\u53ca\u75be\u75c5\u5371\u9669\u56e0\u7d20\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u5ea6\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u4f9b\u548c\u6bd4\u8f83\u76ee\u524d\u5404\u79cd\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u5f0f\u7528\u4e8e\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u89c6\u7f51\u819c\u75c5\u53d8\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u7684\u8bc1\u636e\u3002.", "The extent and specifics regarding cognitive dysfunction in patients with bipolar disorder (BD) or major depressive disorder (MDD) and their unaffected first-degree relatives (FDR) have not been addressed in any single study. The present study compared the cognitive function of patients with BD or MDD, their FDR, and healthy control (HC) individuals.\nThe study population comprised adults (aged 18-55 years) with BD, adults with MDD, FDR (children or siblings of patients with BD or MDD), and HC (n = 105, 109, 85, and 95, respectively). The Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status was used to assess neurocognitive functions, with five domains and 12 tests. A Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale brief form was applied to evaluate IQ. Status of mood was assessed using the Young Mania Rating Scale and the Hamilton Depression Scale.\nThe mixed model indicated significant variation among the four groups in cognitive function. Cognitive impairments, compared to HC, progressively greater from least to most were found in: FDR, MDD, and BD (F = 32.74, P < 0.001). Years of education correlated with cognitive performance (F = 17.04, P < 0.001), as did IQ (F = 240.63, P < 0.001). The total score for the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression negatively correlated with cognitive function (F = 5.78, P = 0.017).\nAmong the study groups, patients with BD had the most severe deficits, followed by MDD patients and FDR. Cognitive deficits could not be associated with a specific psychiatric disorder, but differences in degree were noted.", "The colonial era witnessed a fevered quest for exotic medicinal plants by European physicians and scientists. This essay explores the geographical principles that oriented the search towards the lands and peoples of the humid tropics. Believing that God had planted botanical cures for diseases in their places of origin, medicinal plant collectors concentrated their efforts in the pestilential equatorial latitudes. Although many subscribed to the ancient Doctrine of Signatures, colonial bioprospectors discovered early that indigenous and diasporic peoples represented storehouses of plant knowledge. Assuming that native knowhow constituted more instinct than intelligence, Europeans employed coercion, bribes, torture, and promises of freedom to extract their ethnomedical secrets. In the case of especially lucrative healing plants, imperial and colonial entities conspired to pilfer and naturalize endemic species in their distant colonies. In response to this legacy of inappropriate exploitation of native peoples and tropical plants during the colonial era, most present day bioprospectors follow established codes of ethnobotanical ethics.", "Development of an effective machine-learning model for T-cell Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) epitopes is beneficial for saving biologist's time and effort for identifying epitope in a targeted antigen. Existing NetMHC 2.2, NetMHC 2.3, NetMHC 3.0 and NetMHC 4.0 estimate binding capacity of peptide. This is still a challenge for those servers to predict whether a given peptide is M. tuberculosis epitope or non-epitope. One of the servers, CTLpred, works in this category but it is limited to peptide length of 9-mers. Therefore, in this work direct method of predicting M. tuberculosis epitope or non-epitope has been proposed which also overcomes the limitations of above servers. The proposed method is able to work with variable length epitopes having size even greater than 9-mers. Identification of T-cell or B-cell epitopes in the targeted antigen is the main goal in designing epitope-based vaccine, immune-diagnostic tests and antibody production. Therefore, it is important to introduce a reliable system which may help in the diagnosis of M. tuberculosis. In the present study, computational intelligence methods are used to classify T-cell M. tuberculosis epitopes. The caret feature selection approach is used to find out the set of relevant features. The ensemble model is designed by combining three models and is used to predict M. tuberculosis epitopes of variable length (7-40-mers). The proposed ensemble model achieves 82.0% accuracy, 0.89 specificity, 0.77 sensitivity with repeated k-fold cross-validation having average accuracy of 80.61%. The proposed ensemble model has been validated and compared with NetMHC 2.3, NetMHC 4.0 servers and CTLpred T-cell prediction server.", "To evaluate the application of artificial intelligence (AI), i.e. deep learning and other machine-learning techniques, to amniotic fluid (AF) metabolomics and proteomics, alone and in combination with sonographic, clinical and demographic factors, in the prediction of perinatal outcome in asymptomatic pregnant women with short cervical length (CL).\nAF samples, which had been obtained in the second trimester from asymptomatic women with short CL (<\u200915 mm) identified on transvaginal ultrasound, were analyzed. CL, funneling and the presence of AF 'sludge' were assessed in all cases close to the time of amniocentesis. A combination of liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry and proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy-based metabolomics, as well as targeted proteomics analysis, including chemokines, cytokines and growth factors, was performed on the AF samples. To determine the robustness of the markers, we used six different machine-learning techniques, including deep learning, to predict preterm delivery <\u200934 weeks, latency period prior to delivery <\u200928 days after amniocentesis and requirement for admission to a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Omics biomarkers were evaluated alone and in combination with standard sonographic, clinical and demographic factors to predict outcome. Predictive accuracy was assessed using the area under the receiver-operating characteristics curve (AUC) with 95% CI, sensitivity and specificity.\nOf the 32 patients included in the study, complete omics, demographic and clinical data and outcome information were available for 26. Of these, 11 (42.3%) patients delivered \u2265\u200934 weeks, while 15 (57.7%) delivered <\u200934 weeks. There was no statistically significant difference in CL between these two groups (mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD, 11.2\u2009\u00b1\u20094.4\u2009mm vs 8.9\u2009\u00b1\u20095.3\u2009mm, P\u2009=\u20090.31). Using combined omics, demographic and clinical data, deep learning displayed good to excellent performance, with an AUC (95% CI) of 0.890 (0.810-0.970) for delivery <\u200934 weeks' gestation, 0.890 (0.790-0.990) for delivery <\u200928 days post-amniocentesis and 0.792 (0.689-0.894) for NICU admission. These values were higher overall than for the other five machine-learning methods, although each individual machine-learning technique yielded statistically significant prediction of the different perinatal outcomes.\nThis is the first study to report use of AI with AF proteomics and metabolomics and ultrasound assessment in pregnancy. Machine learning, particularly deep learning, achieved good to excellent prediction of perinatal outcome in asymptomatic pregnant women with short CL in the second trimester.

Here, inspired by the configuration of the human epidermis, we present a flexible three-dimensional (3D) cellular sensor array (CSA) via a one-step thermally induced phase separation method. The CSA was framed by the 3D cellular electret with caged piezoelectric nanoparticles, which was ultrathin (80 \u03bcm), lightweight, and highly\u00a0robust. For biomedical sensing, the 3D-CSA holds a decent pressure sensitivity up to 0.19 V kPa-1 with a response time of less than 16 ms. Owing to its rigid structural symmetry, the 3D-CSA could be identically operated from its\u00a0both sides.\u00a0It was demonstrated to successfully measure the human heartbeat, detect the eyeball motion for sleeping monitoring, and tactile imaging. Mimicking the functionalities of the human skin with a self-powered operation feature, the 3D-CSA was expected to represent a substantial advancement in wearable electronics for healthcare.", "With the development of Industry 4.0, the cooperation between robots and people is increasing. Therefore, man-machine security is the first problem that must be solved. In this paper, we proposed a novel methodology of active collision avoidance to safeguard the human who enters the robot's workspace. In the conventional approaches of obstacle avoidance, it is not easy for robots and humans to work safely in the common unstructured environment due to the lack of the intelligence. In this system, one Kinect is employed to monitor the workspace of the robot and detect anyone who enters the workspace of the robot. Once someone enters the working space, the human will be detected, and the skeleton of the human can be calculated in real time by the Kinect. The measurement errors increase over time, owing to the tracking error and the noise of the device. Therefore we use an Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) to estimate the positions of the skeleton points. We employ an expert system to estimate the behavior of the human. Then let the robot avoid the human by taking different measures, such as stopping, bypassing the human or getting away. Finally, when the robot needs to execute bypassing the human in real time, to achieve this, we adopt a method called artificial potential field method to generate a new path for the robot. By using this active collision avoidance, the system can achieve the purpose that the robot is unable to touch on the human. This proposed system highlights the advantage that during the process, it can first detect the human, then analyze the motion of the human and finally safeguard the human. We experimentally tested the active collision avoidance system in real-world applications. The results of the test indicate that it can effectively ensure human security.", "The construct of emotional intelligence (EI) broadly reflects the idea that individuals differ in their disposition/ability to adaptively generate, recognize, understand, and regulate the emotions of self and others. However, while the neural processes underlying such differences have begun to receive investigation, no brain-based model of EI has yet been proposed to help guide the design and interpretation of neuroimaging research in this area. In this article, we propose a neural model of EI to fill this need. This model incorporates recent insights from emotion theory, computational neuroscience, and large-scale network models of brain function. It also highlights several domain general processes - including those underlying conceptualization, automatic attention, habit formation, and cognitive control - that offer plausible targets for improving EI with training. Our model offers considerable promise in advancing understanding of intelligent emotional functioning and in guiding future neuroscience research on EI.", "Maladaptive interpersonal schemas can trigger distressing emotions and drive dysfunctional behaviour that leads to difficulties in interpersonal relationships and perpetuates the original maladaptive schemas. This study sought to identify patterns of association between trait emotional intelligence (TEI), early maladaptive schemas (EMS), and coping styles in a non-clinical sample. Emotionality profiles were hypothesized to be associated with EMS severity and poorer coping, as early experiences can shape an individual's self-perceptions through reinforcement by maladaptive responses.\nCross-sectional study with 142 undergraduate students.\nWe obtained self-reports of TEI, coping styles, and EMS.\nDisengagement coping was strongly correlated with EMS severity (r\u00a0=\u00a0.565, p\u00a0<\u00a0.01). TEI was negatively correlated with EMS (r\u00a0=\u00a0-.660, p\u00a0<\u00a0.01) and Disengagement (r\u00a0=\u00a0-.405, p\u00a0<\u00a0.01). Emotionality, Impaired Autonomy, and Overvigilance partially mediated the relationship between Disconnection and Emotion-Focused Disengagement. Self-Control fully mediated the relationship between Impaired Limits and Problem-Focused Disengagement.\nThe findings suggest that lower TEI is associated with the likelihood for maladaptive coping in response to EMS. The preference for certain coping styles associated with a particular domain of EMS may be explained by an individual's perceived metacognitive ability to regulate their stress and emotions. When individuals' needs for love, safety, and acceptance from others are not met, there might be poorer perceived self-efficacies in Emotionality and the tendency to cope through emotional avoidance. Individuals with difficulties establishing internal limits are more likely to respond with problem avoidance, possibly due to deficient distress tolerance. Longitudinal studies with a clinical population are warranted to replicate these findings.\nClinicians will likely find it helpful to consider their clients' TEI to facilitate more individualized formulation and treatment planning, by considering whether related emotional regulation problems might be innate or a deficit in skills Implies the need to do more basic emotional regulation work to supplement and strengthen the established imagery work in schema therapy (ST).", "Conductive hydrogels have attracted increasing attention because of their important application in flexible pressure sensors. However, designing hydrogels with a combination of excellent mechanical properties, high sensitivity, and good biocompatibility is still a profound challenge. Here we report a conductive and biocompatible PVA-Gelatin-nHAP hydrogel (PGHAP gel) by connecting a double network with inorganic nano-particles via ionic bonds. The as-prepared gel achieves excellent elasticity and good fatigue resistance even after 50 cycles of compression. Then a hydrogel pressure sensor was obtained using the as-prepared gel, exhibiting high pressure sensitivity almost linearly responding up to 1.5 kPa and adequate stability of the capacitance-pressure over 4 cycles. These results demonstrate the great potential applications of the hydrogel in biomedical devices, including artificial intelligence, human motion detection, and wearable devices.", "Illness impact on HrQoL has been widely studied in hair loss-affected patients, yet no study has addressed whether individual differences modulate HrQoL in patients with alopecia areata (AA), androgenetic alopecia (AGA) and telogen effluvium (TE).\nTo identify the personality dimensions most predictive of the impact of disease on HrQoL.\nA single-site cross-sectional study was carried out in the Dermatology Unit of Sant'Orsola-Malpighi Hospital, Bologna between September 2016 and September 2017. The study included 143 patients (105 females, ages 18-60\u00a0years) diagnosed with AA (n\u00a0=\u00a027), AGA (n\u00a0=\u00a080) and TE (n\u00a0=\u00a036). Illness severity, alopecia type, age, gender, education and civil status were documented. Health-related quality of life (HrQoL), personality traits, trait anxiety, emotional intelligence, social anxiety and social phobia were also measured.\nAA, AGA and TE groups differed significantly for illness severity with most severe patients falling in AA type. For HrQoL, Gender\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0Group interaction resulted significant with AGA females reporting a higher impact of hair loss on quality of life than males, while TE males were more impacted by hair loss than AA and AGA males. Lower scores were obtained by AGA females than males on emotional intelligence while no significant differences were evidenced on other groups. A significant Gender \u00d7 Group interaction was also found for trait anxiety, social phobia and social anxiety: consistently, AGA females reported higher scores than AGA males in all three measures. Finally, discriminant analysis evidenced that anxiety-related traits can contribute to reliably predict hair loss impact on HrQoL, regardless of illness severity and alopecia type.\nWe recommend that gender and individual differences in anxiety-related dimensions be considered as key factors in gaining a deeper understanding of hair loss impact on quality of life as well as in reducing the burden of illness in alopecia-affected patients.", "In social, personality and mental health research, the tendency to select absolute end-points on Likert scales has been linked to certain cultures, lower intelligence, lower income and personality/mental health disorders. It is unclear whether this response style reflects an absolutist cognitive style or is merely an experimental artefact. In this study, we introduce an alternative, more informative, flexible and ecologically valid approach for estimating absolute responding, that uses natural language markers. We focussed on 'function words' (e.g. particles, conjunctions, prepositions) as they are more generalizable because they do not depend on any specific context. To identify such linguistic markers and test their generalizability, we conducted a text analysis of online reviews for films, tourist attractions and consumer products. All written reviews were accompanied by a rating scale (akin to Likert scale), which allowed us to label text samples as absolute/moderate. The data was split into independent 'training' and 'test' sets. Using the training set we identified a rank order of linguistic markers for absolute and moderate text, which were evaluated in a classifier on the test set. The top three markers alone (\"but\", \"!\" and \"seem\") produced 88% classification accuracy, which increased to 91% using 31 linguistic markers.", "Central nervous system (CNS) features in children with permanent neonatal diabetes (PNDM) due to KCNJ11 mutations have a major impact on affected families. Sulfonylurea therapy achieves outstanding metabolic control but only partial improvement in CNS features. The effects of KCNJ11 mutations on the adult brain and their functional impact are not well understood. We aimed to characterize the CNS features in adults with KCNJ11 PNDM compared with adults with INS PNDM.\nAdults with PNDM due to KCNJ11 mutations (n = 8) or INS mutations (n = 4) underwent a neurological examination and completed standardized neuropsychological tests/questionnaires about development/behavior. Four individuals in each group underwent a brain MRI scan. Test scores were converted to Z scores using normative data, and outcomes were compared between groups.\nIn individuals with KCNJ11 mutations, neurological examination was abnormal in seven of eight; predominant features were subtle deficits in coordination/motor sequencing. All had delayed developmental milestones and/or required learning support/special schooling. Half had features and/or a clinical diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder. KCNJ11 mutations were also associated with impaired attention, working memory, and perceptual reasoning and reduced intelligence quotient (IQ) (median IQ KCNJ11 vs. INS mutations 76 vs. 111, respectively; P = 0.02). However, no structural brain abnormalities were noted on MRI. The severity of these features was related to the specific mutation, and they were absent in individuals with INS mutations.\nKCNJ11 PNDM is associated with specific CNS features that are not due to long-standing diabetes, persist into adulthood despite sulfonylurea therapy, and represent the major burden from KCNJ11 mutations.", "The assessment of long-term outcomes in survivors born with extremely low birth weights (ELBWs) has become increasingly important. However, little has been reported on the physical fitness of non-disabled school-aged children born with ELBWs.\nTo assess the physical fitness of non-disabled school-aged children born with ELBWs.\nRetrospective cohort study.\nWe analyzed 169 ELBW infants without cerebral palsy or intellectual disability (based on the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Third Edition (WISC-III) Full Scale intelligence quotient (IQ) test\u202f<\u202f70).\nPhysical fitness was assessed using the grip strength, sit-up repetitions, sit & reach, side steps, standing long jump, and softball throw tests. T-scores were calculated using national survey data.\nThe T-scores for the grip strength, sit-up repetitions, sit & reach, side steps, standing long jump, softball throw tests, and the overall T-score were 43.7\u202f\u00b1\u202f7.5, 44.2\u202f\u00b1\u202f10.5, 46.0\u202f\u00b1\u202f9.7, 40.9\u202f\u00b1\u202f8.0, 40.0\u202f\u00b1\u202f9.8, 42.4\u202f\u00b1\u202f8.1, and 42.9\u202f\u00b1\u202f5.5, respectively. After adjusting for other age-related factors, the height (SD score), WISC-III Performance IQ score, and percent predicted forced vital capacity (FVC) independently predicted the overall T-scores. Their standardized partial regression coefficients (\u03b2) were 0.334 (p\u202f=\u202f0.009), 0.190 (p\u202f=\u202f0.022), and 0.187 (p\u202f=\u202f0.032), respectively.\nOur cohort's physical fitness at approximately 8\u202fyears of age was significantly impaired compared to average Japanese children of the same age.

Total deal value in the second quarter did not quite reach the peak of 2014 (paced by Novartis' USD 16 billion purchase of GlaxoSmithKline's oncology portfolio) but eclipsed the previous quarter primarily due to Allogene's USD 2.8 billion license for Cellectis' chimeric antigen receptor T-cell immunotherapy program for cancer.", "Mentorship is an important driver of professional development and scholarship in academic medicine. Several mentorship models have been described in the medical education literature, with the majority featuring a hierarchical relationship between senior and junior members of an institution. 'Mastermind Groups', popularized in the business world, offer an alternative model of group mentorship that benefits from the combined intelligence and accumulated experience of the participants involved. We describe an online application of the Mastermind model, used as an opportunity for faculty development by a globally distributed team of health professions educators. The majority of our participants rated their experiences over two online Mastermind group mentoring sessions as 'very valuable', resulting in recommendations of specific developmental resources, professional referrals, and identifiable immediate 'next steps' for their careers. Our experience suggests that online Mastermind groups are an effective, feasible, zero-cost model for group mentorship and professional development in medicine.", "To improve the efficiency of the periodic surveys of the asphalt pavement condition, this study puts forward an intelligent method for automating the classification of pavement crack patterns. The new approach relies on image processing techniques and computational intelligence algorithms. The image processing techniques of Laplacian pyramid and projection integral are employed to extract numerical features from digital images. Least squares support vector machine (LSSVM) and Differential Flower Pollination (DFP) are the two computational intelligence algorithms that are employed to construct the crack classification model based on the extracted features. LSSVM is employed for data classification. In addition, the model construction phase of LSSVM requires a proper setting of the regularization and kernel function parameters. This study relies on DFP to fine-tune these two parameters of LSSVM. A dataset consisting of 500 image samples and five class labels of alligator crack, diagonal crack, longitudinal crack, no crack, and transverse crack has been collected to train and verify the established approach. The experimental results show that the Laplacian pyramid is really helpful to enhance the pavement images and reveal the crack patterns. Moreover, the hybridization of LSSVM and DFP, named as DFP-LSSVM, used with the Laplacian pyramid at the level 4 can help us to achieve the highest classification accuracy rate of 93.04%. Thus, the new hybrid approach of DFP-LSSVM is a promising tool to assist transportation agencies in the task of pavement condition surveying.", "As a chronic disease, diabetes mellitus has emerged as a worldwide epidemic. The aim of this study is to classify diabetes disease by developing an intelligence system using machine learning techniques. Our method is developed through clustering, noise removal and classification approaches. Accordingly, we use expectation maximization, principal component analysis and support vector machine for clustering, noise removal and classification tasks, respectively. We also develop the proposed method for incremental situation by applying the incremental principal component analysis and incremental support vector machine for incremental learning of data. Experimental results on Pima Indian Diabetes dataset show that proposed method remarkably improves the accuracy of prediction and reduces computation time in relation to the non-incremental approaches. The hybrid intelligent system can assist medical practitioners in the healthcare practice as a decision support system.", "The present era of precision medicine sees \"cancer\" as a consequence of molecular derangements occurring at the commencement of the disease process, with morphological changes happening much later in the process of tumourigenesis. Conventional imaging techniques, such as computed tomography (CT), ultrasound (US) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) play an integral role in the detection of disease at the macroscopic level. However, molecular functional imaging (MFI) techniques entail the visualisation and quantification of biochemical and physiological processes occurring during tumourigenesis. MFI has the potential to play a key role in heralding the transition from the concept of \"one-size-fits-all\" treatment to \"precision medicine\". Integration of MFI with other fields of tumour biology such as genomics has spawned a novel concept called \"radiogenomics\", which could serve as an indispensable tool in translational cancer research. With recent advances in medical image processing, such as texture analysis, deep learning and artificial intelligence, the future seems promising; however, their clinical utility remains unproven at present. Despite the emergence of novel imaging biomarkers, the majority of these require validation before clinical translation is possible. In this two part\u00a0review, we discuss the systematic collaboration across structural, anatomical and molecular imaging techniques that constitute MFI. Part I reviews positron emission tomography, radiogenomics, AI, and optical imaging, while part II reviews MRI, CT and ultrasound, their current status, and recent advances in the field of precision oncology.", "The Job Demands\u2013Resources Theory (JD-R) is one of the most influential theoretical frameworks for explaining work engagement. The JD-R postulates the existence of a health impairment process in which job demands lead to strain, and of a motivational process in which job resources lead to work engagement. Although cognitive functions are among the most important characteristics of employees related to job, still little is known about its moderating role in JD-R processes; hence in this study we make a novel attempt to test the invariance of JD-R propositions among employees at different levels of cognitive functioning.\nA group of 383 multioccupational employees completed a set of questionnaires measuring job resource: co-worker support, supervisor support, performance feedback; job demands: emotional demands, occupational constraints, work-home interferences; Utrecht Work Engagement Scale; Oldenburg Burnout Inventory along with 2 working memory and 3 fluid intelligence tests.\nThe multigroup invariance analysis with latent variables revealed that both the health impairment process and the motivational process as postulated by JD-R are invariant across groups of employees with either high or low levels of fluid intelligence and working memory capacity.\nThis result provides the first piece of evidence for JD-R robustness among employees at different levels of cognitive functioning. Our findings counterintuitively suggest that employees with high cognitive functioning are not more resistant to job demands than employees with low cognitive functioning and that in order to be work-engaged they need job resources, no less than their colleagues with low cognitive functioning.

Then, cognitive radio networks (CRNs) as one of those important solutions mentioned above, are used to achieve IoT effectively. Generally, dynamic resource allocation plays a crucial role in the design of CRN-aided IoT systems. Aiming at this issue, orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) has been identified as one of the successful technologies, which works with a multi-carrier parallel radio transmission strategy. In this article, through the use of swarm intelligence paradigm, a solution approach is accordingly proposed by employing an efficient Jaya algorithm, called PA-Jaya, to deal with the power allocation problem in cognitive OFDM radio networks for IoT. Because of the algorithm-specific parameter-free feature in the proposed PA-Jaya algorithm, a satisfactory computational performance could be achieved in the handling of this problem. For this optimization problem with some constraints, the simulation results show that compared with some popular algorithms, the efficiency of spectrum utilization could be further improved by using PA-Jaya algorithm with faster convergence speed, while maximizing the total transmission rate.", "Background Adipocytokines may play a role in fetal programming of neurodevelopment. We aimed to investigate the associations between cord blood adipocytokine concentrations and children's intelligence test scores. Methods We used data from two ongoing pregnancy cohorts in North America: the Maternal-Infant Research on Environmental Chemicals (MIREC, n\u2009=\u2009429) and Health Outcomes and Measures of the Environment (HOME, n\u2009=\u2009183) Studies. Umbilical cord blood adipocytokine concentrations were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. We assessed children's Intelligence Quotient (IQ) and its components using the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scales of Intelligence-III or Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-IV. We used linear regression and linear mixed models to estimate associations between log2-transformed adipocytokine concentrations and children's IQ after adjusting for sociodemographic, perinatal, and child factors. Results After adjusting for covariates, cord blood adiponectin was positively associated with children's full-scale IQ scores at age 3 years in the MIREC Study (\u03b2\u2009=\u20091.4, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.2, 2.5) and at ages 5 and 8 years in the HOME Study (\u03b2\u2009=\u20091.7, CI: -0.1, 3.5). Adiponectin was positively associated with performance IQ in both studies (MIREC: \u03b2\u2009=\u20092.0, CI: 0.7, 3.3; HOME: \u03b2\u2009=\u20092.2, CI: 0.5, 3.9). Adiponectin was positively associated with working memory composite scores at age 8 in the HOME Study (\u03b2\u2009=\u20093.1, CI: 1.0, 5.2). Leptin was not associated with children's IQ in either study. Conclusions Cord blood adiponectin was associated with higher full-scale and performance IQ and working memory composite scores in children. Future studies are needed to explore the mechanisms underlying these associations.", "This paper will outline the systematic approach taken in University College Dublin to ensure that students with a disability are adequately supported and have full and equal access to their chosen college course. UCD were early adopters of the mainstreaming model recognising that specialist services could not adequately support the increasing numbers of students declaring a disability and that a whole college approach was required. This paper describes the opportunistic changes to a student support structure that have consolidated mainstreaming and enhanced supports for students with disabilities in a large Irish university Giving responsibility to specific roles throughout the college and sharing information in a systematic way ensures that consideration is given to all students with disabilities and not just those who have a visible disability or have the confidence to make themselves known to faculty and other staff. Knowledge of the diversity in the classroom has encouraged faculty to consider Universal Design in the construction and delivery of their courses and pockets of good practice have led to widespread recognition that this approach is not only beneficial to students with disabilities, but the entire student population which is becoming increasingly diverse. The systems we will describe include an integrated student record and Needs Assessment, the use of class lists to share information to target groups and a sophisticated exam reporting system, all of which have led to a streamlined service with minimal administrative requirements. We will also describe the business intelligence tools used to provide a visual representation of Widening Participation data for individual programme areas which ensures that College Principles are cognisant of their progress relative to national targets and where resources should be focused.", "Interpersonal relationships are fundamental to competent delivery of health care.

As a large amount of data will be produced in the process of diagnosis and treatment of diseases, it is necessary to utilize the artificial intelligence such as machine learning to analyze complex, multi-dimensional and multi-scale data and to construct clinical decision support tools. It will provide a method to figure out rapid and effective programs in diagnosis and treatment. In this process, the choice of artificial intelligence seems to be particularly important, such as machine learning. The article reviews the type and algorithm of machine learning used in clinical decision support, such as support vector machines, logistic regression, clustering algorithms, Bagging, random forests and deep learning. The application of machine learning and other methods in clinical decision support has been summarized and classified. The advantages and disadvantages of machine learning are elaborated.

When exposed to a physical or cognitive challenge, individuals with MS tend to exhibit greater declines in task performance (performance fatigability) and increased levels of self-reported fatigue (perceived fatigability), but these effects may be attenuated by greater intellectual capacity. The purpose of our study was to examine the influence of intelligence on fatigability in persons with MS. We hypothesized that greater intellectual capacity confers some protection against heightened levels of fatigue and fatigability associated with MS. Twelve adults with relapsing-remitting MS were compared with 12 control (CO) subjects who were matched for age, sex, and premorbid intellectual capacity. Performance fatigability was measured as the decline in maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) torque after 60 isometric contractions (10 s contraction at 25% MVC, 5 s rest) performed with the knee extensor muscles. Perceived fatigability was assessed with the modified fatigue impact scale (MFIS) questionnaire (trait fatigability) and the Borg rating of perceived exertion (RPE, state fatigability). Persons with MS reported greater MFIS scores (MS: 43 \u00b1 14; CO: 11 \u00b1 8, P \u2264 0.001). Initial MVC torque for the knee extensors did not differ between the groups (MS: 112 \u00b1 38 N\u22c5m; CO: 107 \u00b1 44 N\u22c5m) and the decline (performance fatigability) was similar for both groups (MS: -16 \u00b1 19 N\u22c5m; CO: -13 \u00b1 16 N\u22c5m). RPE increased during the fatiguing contraction for both groups (P < 0.001) but was significantly greater in magnitude (main effect for group, P = 0.03) and increased more for the MS group (group \u00d7 time interaction, P = 0.05). Torque steadiness declined during the fatiguing contractions (main effect for time, P = 0.05) and was less steady for the MS group (main effect for group, P = 0.02). Performance and full-4 IQ was correlated with the decline in torque steadiness for the MS group (r = -0.63, P < 0.05; r = -0.64, P < 0.05). Intellectual capacity was not associated with fatigability in persons with MS but was associated with adjustments in muscle activation during the fatiguing contractions.", "In recent years, artificial neural networks have become the flagship algorithm of artificial intelligence1. In these systems, neuron activation functions are static, and computing is achieved through standard arithmetic operations. By contrast, a prominent branch of neuroinspired computing embraces the dynamical nature of the brain and proposes to endow each component of a neural network with dynamical functionality, such as oscillations, and to rely on emergent physical phenomena, such as synchronization2-6, for solving complex problems with small networks7-11. This approach is especially interesting for hardware implementations, because emerging nanoelectronic devices can provide compact and energy-efficient nonlinear auto-oscillators that mimic the periodic spiking activity of biological neurons12-16. The dynamical couplings between oscillators can then be used to mediate the synaptic communication between the artificial neurons. One challenge for using nanodevices in this way is to achieve learning, which requires fine control and tuning of their coupled oscillations17; the dynamical features of nanodevices can be difficult to control and prone to noise and variability18. Here we show that the outstanding tunability of spintronic nano-oscillators-that is, the possibility of accurately controlling their frequency across a wide range, through electrical current and magnetic field-can be used to address this challenge. We successfully train a hardware network of four spin-torque nano-oscillators to recognize spoken vowels by tuning their frequencies according to an automatic real-time learning rule. We show that the high experimental recognition rates stem from the ability of these oscillators to synchronize. Our results demonstrate that non-trivial pattern classification tasks can be achieved with small hardware neural networks by endowing them with nonlinear dynamical features such as oscillations and synchronization.", "Past research suggests that youth with sex chromosome aneuploidies (SCAs) present with verbal fluency deficits. However, most studies have focused on sex chromosome trisomies. Far less is known about sex chromosome tetrasomies and pentasomies. Thus, the current research sought to characterize verbal fluency performance among youth with sex chromosome trisomies, tetrasomies, and pentasomies by contrasting how performance varies as a function of extra X number and X versus Y status.\nParticipants included 79 youth with SCAs and 42 typically developing controls matched on age, maternal education, and racial/ethnic background. Participants completed the phonemic and semantic conditions of a verbal fluency task and an abbreviated intelligence test.\nBoth supernumerary X and Y chromosomes were associated with verbal fluency deficits relative to controls. These impairments increased as a function of the number of extra X chromosomes, and the pattern of impairments on phonemic and semantic fluency differed for those with a supernumerary X versus Y chromosome. Whereas one supernumerary Y chromosome was associated with similar performance across fluency conditions, one supernumerary X chromosome was associated with relatively stronger semantic than phonemic fluency skills.\nVerbal fluency skills in youth with supernumerary X and Y chromosomes are impaired relative to controls. However, the degree of impairment varies across groups and task condition. Further research into the cognitive underpinnings of verbal fluency in youth with SCAs may provide insights into their verbal fluency deficits and help guide future treatments.

However, while brain disease diagnosis from the brain scan images is supported by imaging robotics, the data analysis to form a medical diagnosis is performed solely by highly trained medical professionals. Recent advances in medical imaging techniques, artificial intelligence, machine learning and computer vision present new opportunities to build intelligent decision support tools to aid the diagnostic process, increase the disease detection accuracy, reduce error, automate the monitoring of patient's recovery, and discover new knowledge about the disease cause and its treatment. This article introduces the topic of medical diagnosis of brain diseases from the MRI based images. We describe existing, multi-modal imaging techniques of the brain's soft tissue and describe in detail how are the resulting images are analyzed by a radiologist to form a diagnosis. Several comparisons between the best results of classifying natural scenes and medical image analysis illustrate the challenges of applying existing image processing techniques to the medical image analysis domain. The survey of medical image processing methods also identified several knowledge gaps, the need for automation of image processing analysis, and the identification of the brain structures in the medical images that differentiate healthy tissue from a pathology. This survey is grounded in the cases of brain tumor analysis and the traumatic brain injury diagnoses, as these two case studies illustrate the vastly different approaches needed to define, extract, and synthesize meaningful information from multiple MRI image sets for a diagnosis. Finally, the article summarizes artificial intelligence frameworks that are built as multi-stage, hybrid, hierarchical information processing work-flows and the benefits of applying these models for medical diagnosis to build intelligent physician's aids with knowledge transparency, expert knowledge embedding, and increased analytical quality.", "Increasingly serious electromagnetic radiation pollution puts higher demands on wearable devices. Electronic sensor skin capable of shielding electromagnetic radiation can provide extra protection in emerging fields such as electronic skins, robotics, and artificial intelligence, but combining the sensation and electromagnetic shielding performance together remains a great challenge. Here, inspired by the structure and functions of the human skin, a multifunctional electronic skin (M-E-skin) with both tactile sensing and electromagnetic radiation shielding functions is proposed. The tactile sensing of human skin is mimicked with irregular dermislike rough surfaces, and the electromagnetic shielding performance not available on natural skin is introduced by mimicking the ultraviolet electromagnetic radiation absorption of melanin in epidermis. The M-E-skin shows superior sensitivity (9.8 \u00d7 104 kPa-1 for the pressure range 0-0.2 kPa and 3.5 \u00d7 103 kPa-1 within 0.2-20 kPa), broad operating range (0-20 kPa), fast response and relaxation times (<62.5 ms), great pressuring-relaxing stability (10 kPa, 1000 cycles), low operating voltage (0.1 V), low power consumption (1.5 nW), and low detection limit (5 Pa). Besides, a broad range of electromagnetic wave (0.5-7.5 GHz) is shielded more than 99.66% by the M-E-skin. This work holds great potential to enlarge the application scope of current electronic skins.", "Phishing email is one of the biggest risks to online information security due to its ability to exploit human trust and naivety. Prior research has examined whether some people are more susceptible to phishing than others and what characteristics may predict this susceptibility. Given that there are no standardised measures or methodologies to detect phishing susceptibility, results have conflicted. To address this issue, the current study created a 40-item phishing detection task to measure both cognitive and behavioural indicators of phishing susceptibility and false positives (misjudged genuine email). The task is based on current real-life email stimuli (i.e., phishing and genuine) relevant to the student and general population. Extending previous literature we also designed a methodology for assessing phishing susceptibility by allowing participants to indicate perception of maliciousness of each email type and the actions they would take (keep it, trash it or seek further information). This enabled us to: (1) examine the relationships that psychological variables share with phishing susceptibility and false positives-both captured as consistent tendencies; (2) determine the relationships between perceptions of maliciousness with behavioural outcomes and psychological variables; and (3) determine the relationships between these tendencies and email characteristics. In our study, 150 undergraduate psychology students participated in exchange for partial course credit (98 Females; Mean age = 19.70, SD = 2.27). Participants also completed a comprehensive battery of psychometric tests assessing intelligence, pre- and on-task confidence, Big 6 personality, and familiarity/competence in computing and phishing. Results revealed that people showed distinct and robust tendencies for phishing susceptibility and false positives. A series of regression analyses looking at the accuracy of both phishing and false positives detection revealed that human-centred variables accounted for a good degree of variance in phishing susceptibility (about 54%), with perceptions of maliciousness, intelligence, knowledge of phishing, and on-task confidence contributing significantly, directly and/or indirectly via perception of maliciousness. A regression model looking at discriminating false positives has also shown that human-centred variables accounted for a reasonable degree of variance (41%), with perceptions of maliciousness, intelligence and on-task confidence contributing significantly, directly and/or indirectly via perception of maliciousness. Furthermore, the characteristics of the most effective phishing and misjudged genuine email items were profiled. Based on our findings, we suggest that future research should investigate these significant variables in more detail. We also recommend that future research should capture consistent response tendencies to determine vulnerability to phishing and false positives (rather than a one off response to a single email), and use the collection of the most current phishing email obtained from relevant sources to the population. It is important to capture perceptions of maliciousness of email because it is a key predictor of the action taken on the email. It directly predicts accuracy detection of phishing and genuine email, as well as mediating the relationships between some other predictors whose role would have been overlooked if the perceptions were not captured. The study provides the framework of human-centred variables which predict phishing and false positive susceptibility as well as the characteristics of email which most deceive people.", "In a small percentage of children born with congenital hydrocephalus, enlargement of the head and the presence of ventriculomegaly may halt and ultimately stabilize the condition designated as arrested hydrocephalus. Arrested hydrocephalus in children is typically due to congenital aqueduct stenosis, which can be described appropriately as a stasis existing within the channel between the third and fourth ventricles. Os odontoideum (OO) is an uncommonly occurring pathology at the craniovertebral junction. Although the clinical and radiologic features of its existence and the therapeutic options for its pathology have been widely discussed within the medical literature, its true etiology has been a source of divisive debate, proposing both a traumatic as well as a congenital mechanism. The etiology of OO has been heartily debated in the literature for several years as well. Most authors have come to support a posttraumatic causality. However, strong evidence exists to support a congenital origin to this rarely observed malformation.\nWithin this case study we present a 24-year-old woman with atlantoaxial subluxation that exists secondary to an orthotropic OO. The patient had a history of arrested hydrocephalus due to congenital aqueductal stenosis beginning in early childhood. She presented with normal intelligence and was neurologically without deficits before the occurrence of an atlantoaxial dislocation. Unfortunately, the pathology was initially misdiagnosed as a decompensation state of the arrested hydrocephalus, and after 8 months the patient became wheelchair bound. Following this unfortunate event the correct diagnosis was ultimately uncovered. Subsequently a C2-1 instrumentation procedure resulted in excellent alignment and fusion.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of an aqueduct stenosis in the setting of an existing OO, a combination that might be another clue in favor of a congenital etiology.", "In order to be successful in sport, athletes need a high level of physical skills as well as cognitive abilities.\nThe aim of this studywas to investigate the relationship between emotional intelligence, reaction time, aerobic capacity and performance (recorded time) in female track & field athletes at the Universities of Tehran.\nData was collected from 100 female athletes participating in sprints.The emotional intelligence in athletes was measured by the Bar-On questionnaire, the reaction time was assessed by the psychomotor vigilance task, and maximal aerobic capacity was predicted by step test. Pearson correlation calculations were conducted to investigate the potential relationships between emotional intelligence total score, reaction time, and estimated VO2max, with recorded time of the students.\nAverage age of female athletes was 20.59 years (\u00b11.55) and mean height of them was 163.63\u200acm (\u00b16.03).The mean emotional intelligence in athletes was 302.05 (\u00b120.18), the mean reaction time was 431.14\u200ams (\u00b1114.88), and mean maximal aerobic capacity was predicted as 62.82\u200aml/ kg.min (\u00b10.6). The findings revealed that there is no significant correlation between emotional intelligence and recorded time or athletic performance (p\u200a>\u200a0.05).There were significant correlations between some components of emotional intelligence (empathy, interpersonal relations, and independence) and athletes' recorded time. Reaction time and aerobic capacity were significantly correlated with athletes' performance (p\u200a<\u200a0.05).\nIncreased aerobic capacity and decreased response time (reaction time) resulted in better performance (shorter recorded time) in female student athletes.", "Multicolor flow cytometry (MFC) analysis is widely used to identify minimal residual disease (MRD) after treatment for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). However, current manual interpretation suffers from drawbacks of time consuming and interpreter idiosyncrasy. Artificial intelligence (AI), with the expertise in assisting repetitive or complex analysis, represents a potential solution for these drawbacks.\nFrom 2009 to 2016, 5333 MFC data from 1742 AML or MDS patients were collected. The 287 MFC data at post-induction were selected as the outcome set for clinical outcome validation. The rest were 4:1 randomized into the training set (n\u202f=\u202f4039) and the validation set (n\u202f=\u202f1007). AI algorithm learned a multi-dimensional MFC phenotype from the training set and input it to support vector machine (SVM) classifier after Gaussian mixture model (GMM) modeling, and the performance was evaluated in The validation set.\nPromising accuracies (84\u00b76% to 92\u00b74%) and AUCs (0\u00b7921-0\u00b7950) were achieved by the developed algorithms. Interestingly, the algorithm from even one testing tube achieved similar performance. The clinical significance was validated in the outcome set, and normal MFC interpreted by the AI predicted better progression-free survival (10\u00b79 vs 4\u00b79\u202fmonths, p\u202f<\u202f0\u00b70001) and overall survival (13\u00b76 vs 6\u00b75\u202fmonths, p\u202f<\u202f0\u00b70001) for AML.\nThrough large-scaled clinical validation, we showed that AI algorithms can produce efficient and clinically-relevant MFC analysis. This approach also possesses a great advantage of the ability to integrate other clinical tests.

In the proposed method, the squared error difference between the desired and designed responses of a filter is minimized. FDs are introduced to achieve higher accuracy at the reference frequency ( \u03c90 ), which helps to reduce the overall phase error. In this paper, two approaches are used for finding the appropriate values of the FDs and reference frequencies. In the first approach, these values are estimated from a series of experiments, which require more computation time but produce less accurate results. These experiments, however, justify the behavior of the error function, with respect to the FD and \u03c90 , as a multimodal and nonconvex problem. In the second approach, a variant of the swarm-intelligence-based multimodal search space technique, known as the constraint-factor particle swarm optimization, is exploited for finding the suitable values for the FD and \u03c90 . The performance of the proposed FD-based method is measured in terms of fidelity aspects, such as the maximum phase error, total squared phase error, maximum group delay error, and total squared group delay error. The FD-based approach is found to reduce the total phase error by 57% by exploiting only two FDs.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) is a commonly used term in daily life, and there are now two subconcepts that divide the entire range of meanings currently encompassed by the term. The coexistence of the concepts of strong and weak AI can be seen as a result of the recognition of the limits of mathematical and engineering concepts that have dominated the definition. This presentation reviewed the concept, history, and the current application of AI in daily life. Applications of AI are becoming a reality that is commonplace in all areas of modern human life. Efforts to develop robots controlled by AI have been continuously carried out to maximize human convenience. AI has also been applied in the medical decision-making process, and these AI systems can help nonspecialists to obtain expert-level information. Artificial neural networks are highly interconnected networks of computer processors inspired by biological nervous systems. These systems may help connect dental professionals all over the world. Currently, the use of AI is rapidly advancing beyond text-based, image-based dental practice. This presentation reviewed the history of artificial neural networks in the medical and dental fields, as well as current application in dentistry. As the use of AI in the entire medical field increases, the role of AI in dentistry will be greatly expanded. Currently, the use of AI is rapidly advancing beyond text-based, image-based dental practice. In addition to diagnosis of visually confirmed dental caries and impacted teeth, studies applying machine learning based on artificial neural networks to dental treatment through analysis of dental magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, and cephalometric radiography are actively underway, and some visible results are emerging at a rapid pace for commercialization.", "Digital health is capturing the attention of the healthcare community. This paradigm whereby healthcare meets the internet uses sensors that communicate wirelessly along with software residing on smartphones to deliver data, information, treatment recommendations, and in some cases control over an effector device. As artificial intelligence becomes more widely used, this approach to creating individualized treatment plans will increase the opportunities for patients, even if they are in remote settings, to communicate with and learn from healthcare professionals. Simple design is needed to promote use of these tools, especially for the purpose of increased adherence to treatment. Widespread adoption by the healthcare industry will require better outcomes data, which will most likely be in the form of safety and effectiveness results from robust randomized controlled trials, as well as evidence of privacy and security. Such data will be needed to convince investors to direct resources into and regulators to clear new digital health tools. Diabetes Technology Society and William Sansum Diabetes Center launched the Digital Diabetes Congress in 2017 because of great interest in determining the potential benefits, metrics of success, and appropriate components of mobile applications for diabetes. The second annual meeting in this series took place on May 22-23, 2018 in San Francisco. This report contains summaries of the meeting's 4 plenary lectures and 10 sessions. This meeting report presents a summary of how 55 panelists, speakers, and moderators, who are leaders in healthcare technology, see the current and future landscape of digital health tools applied to diabetes.", "Neuropsychological investigations can help untangle the aetiological and phenomenological heterogeneity of schizophrenia but have scarcely been employed in the context of treatment-resistant (TR) schizophrenia. No population-based study has examined neuropsychological function in the first-episode of TR psychosis.\nWe report baseline neuropsychological findings from a longitudinal, population-based study of first-episode psychosis, which followed up cases from index admission to 10 years. At the 10-year follow up patients were classified as treatment responsive or TR after reconstructing their entire case histories. Of 145 cases with neuropsychological data at baseline, 113 were classified as treatment responsive, and 32 as TR at the 10-year follow-up.\nCompared with 257 community controls, both case groups showed baseline deficits in three composite neuropsychological scores, derived from principal component analysis: verbal intelligence and fluency, visuospatial ability and executive function, and verbal memory and learning (p values\u2a7d0.001). Compared with treatment responders, TR cases showed deficits in verbal intelligence and fluency, both in the extended psychosis sample (t = -2.32; p = 0.022) and in the schizophrenia diagnostic subgroup (t = -2.49; p = 0.017). Similar relative deficits in the TR cases emerged in sub-/sensitivity analyses excluding patients with delayed-onset treatment resistance (p values<0.01-0.001) and those born outside the UK (p values<0.05).\nVerbal intelligence and fluency are impaired in patients with TR psychosis compared with those who respond to treatment. This differential is already detectable - at a group level - at the first illness episode, supporting the conceptualisation of TR psychosis as a severe, pathogenically distinct variant, embedded in aberrant neurodevelopmental processes.", "To examine academic performance in dystrophinopathy as a function of dystrophin gene mutation position as well as intellectual function, executive skills, socioeconomic status (SES), behavior, and physical ability.\nIn a cross-sectional study, boys with dystrophinopathy (ages 5-17; n=50) completed tests of academics (Woodcock-Johnson-III: spelling, reading, calculation and total scores), executive functioning (selective attention/inhibitory control, set shifting, working memory, and processing speed), single word comprehension and nonverbal reasoning. Motor skills were assessed and parents provided demographic information and child behavioral assessments. Dystrophin gene mutation positions were dichotomized into groups (upstream versus downstream of exon 43, location of isoforms previously linked to intellectual impairment). Genetic mutation groups were compared on measures of academic achievement, and multiple regression analyses examined unique and joint contributions of executive skills, intelligence quotient (IQ), SES, motor abilities, behavior, and mutation positions to academic outcomes.\nAcademic performance was slightly, yet significantly, lower than IQ and varied as a function of dystrophin gene position, wherein boys possessing the downstream mutation exhibited greater impairment than boys with the upstream mutation. Digit span forward (indexing verbal span), but no other measure of executive function, contributed significant variance to total academic achievement, spelling and calculation.\nWeak academic performance is associated with dystrophinopathy and is more common in downstream mutations. A specific deficit in verbal span may underlie inefficiencies observed in children with dystrophinopathy and may drive deficits impacting academic abilities. (JINS, 2018, 24, 928-938).", "Processing speed is a psychological construct that refers to the speed with which an individual can perform any cognitive operation. Processing speed correlates strongly with general cognitive ability, declines sharply with age and is impaired across a number of neurological and psychiatric disorders. Thus, identifying genes that influence processing speed will likely improve understanding of the genetics of intelligence, biological aging and the etiologies of numerous disorders. Previous genetics studies of processing speed have relied on simple phenotypes (eg, mean reaction time) derived from single tasks. This strategy assumes, erroneously, that processing speed is a unitary construct. In the present study, we aimed to characterize the genetic architecture of processing speed by using a multidimensional model applied to a battery of cognitive tasks. Linkage and QTL-specific association analyses were performed on the factors from this model. The randomly ascertained sample comprised 1291 Mexican-American individuals from extended pedigrees. We found that performance on all three distinct processing-speed factors (Psychomotor Speed; Sequencing and Shifting and Verbal Fluency) were moderately and significantly heritable. We identified a genome-wide significant quantitative trait locus (QTL) on chromosome 3q23 for Psychomotor Speed (LOD = 4.83). Within this locus, we identified a plausible and interesting candidate gene for Psychomotor Speed (Z = 2.90, P = 1.86 \u00d7 10-03 ).", "We examined reciprocal, time-ordered associations between age-related changes in fluid intelligence and depressive symptoms. Participants were 1,091 community-dwelling older adults from the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936 study who were assessed repeatedly at 3-year intervals between the ages of 70 and 79 years. On average, fluid intelligence and depressive symptoms worsened with age. There was also a dynamic-coupling effect, in which low fluid intelligence at a given age predicted increasing depressive symptoms across the following 3-year interval, whereas the converse did not hold. Model comparisons showed that this coupling parameter significantly improved overall fit and had a correspondingly moderately strong effect size, accounting on average for an accumulated 0.9 standard-deviation increase in depressive symptoms, following lower cognitive performance, across the observed age range. Adjustment for sociodemographic and health-related covariates did not significantly attenuate this association. This implies that monitoring for cognitive decrements in later life may expedite interventions to reduce related increases in depression risk.", "The aim of this study was to determine the effects of Murashige and Skoog (MS) salts on optimal growth of two pistachio rootstocks, P. vera cv. \"Ghazvini\" and \"UCB1\" using design of experiments (DOE) and artificial intelligence (AI) tools. MS medium with 14 macro-and micro-elements was used as base point and its concentration varied from 0 to 5 \u00d7 MS concentrations. Design of experiments (DOE) software was used to generate a five-dimensional design space by categorizing MS salts into five independent factors (NH4NO3, KNO3, mesos, micros and iron), reducing the experimental design space from 3,125 to just 29 treatments. Typical plant growth parameters such as shoot quality (SQ), proliferation rate (PR), shoot length (SL), and some physiological disorders including shoot-tip necrosis (STN) and callus formation at the base of explants (BC) were evaluated for each treatment. The results were successfully modeled using neurofuzzy logic software. The model delivered new insights, by different sets of \"IF-THEN\" rules, pinpointing the key role of some ion interactions (  SO 4 2 -   \u00d7 Cl-, K+ \u00d7  SO 4 2 -   \u00d7 EDTA-, and Fe2+ \u00d7 Cu2+ \u00d7  NO 3 -   ) for SQ, PR, and SL, whilst physiological disorders (STN and BC) were governed mainly by independent ions as Fe2+ and EDTA-, respectively. In our opinion, the methodology and results obtained in this study is extremely useful to understand the effect of mineral nutrients on pistachio in vitro culture, through discovering new complex interactions among macro-and micro-elements which can be implemented to design new media of plant tissue culture and improve healthy plant micropropagation for any plant species.", "This project seeks to reframe notions and approaches for engagement with neurodiverse groups and individuals using a developed design suite of functioning and dynamic tools and methods underpinned by inclusive principled guidelines which will be used by The Wellcome Collection Hub, the wider organisation and Hub partners to improve inclusion and accessibility. These orthodoxies will aid the reframing of neurodiverse inclusive museum focused interactions and co-creation at the Wellcome Collection Hub. The project, has been undertaken in partnership with the Helen Hamlyn Centre for Design, Royal College of Art and the Wellcome Collection. Museums are re-considering the future of their offerings in its current format, reach and relevance to today's and tomorrow's society where it has become a shifting landscape moving towards multiple modes and alternative interactions with museum based artefacts and content. With an inclusive design approach which centres non-typical visitors, their experiences and requirements, a positive impact can be better obtained and extended engagement fostered, facilitated and enabled to flourish. This study aims to outline some of the approaches undertaken during the study with insights from relevant experts in the field and target group particularly in respect of non-typical reasons for differentiation, requirements and the rainbow of intelligences [27]. The aim will be to additionally demystify and explain how inclusive engagement approaches centre on non-typical visitors and their experiences, which in turn can have a positive impact on The Wellcome Collection Hub community and relevant stakeholders. This approach helps to further the progress of integrating the neurodiversity paradigm and barriers approach when scaffolding engagement and offerings for non-typical and neurodivergent individuals and groups, through encouraging organisational change and a demystifying of neurodivergent centred engagement and co-creation methods; resulting in a reframing of perspectives around integrated offerings, triangulating approaches in neurodiverse spaces for broader audiences. This may include the shifting of outputs and offerings from those of well-intentioned cautious 'accessibility' to one of ambition, inclusivity and achievability. A central goal of Design and The Mind (DTM) is to demystify the invisible barriers and issues surrounding cognitive, physical, digital access and engagement with the Hub and its resources; this approach formed an integral and positive part of the design process, through spotlighting opportunities for innovation. This paper highlights the most salient observations of a live research project. With a duration of 1 year, commencing in October 2017 and concluding in October 2018 is this project will run parallel to the Wellcome Collection Hub's work but will also be a distinct and separate body of research.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) enables machines to provide unparalleled value in a myriad of industries and applications. In recent years, researchers have harnessed artificial intelligence to analyze large-volume, unstructured medical data and perform clinical tasks, such as the identification of diabetic retinopathy or the diagnosis of cutaneous malignancies. Applications of artificial intelligence techniques, specifically machine learning and more recently deep learning, are beginning to emerge in gastrointestinal endoscopy. The most promising of these efforts have been in computer-aided detection and computer-aided diagnosis of colorectal polyps, with recent systems demonstrating high sensitivity and accuracy even when compared to expert human endoscopists. AI has also been utilized to identify gastrointestinal bleeding, to detect areas of inflammation, and even to diagnose certain gastrointestinal infections. Future work in the field should concentrate on creating seamless integration of AI systems with current endoscopy platforms and electronic medical records, developing training modules to teach clinicians how to use AI tools, and determining the best means for regulation and approval of new AI technology.", "Following the increased demand of personalized medicine to precise radiology in advanced gastric cancer, there is particular need for objective and powerful surrogate to help the gastro-radiology to break through the bottleneck of imaging resolution and the defect of subjective diagnosis, which can further improve the efficacy of staging and response evaluation. On the basis of the existing imaging resolution, the radiomics can perform massive data mining through texture analysis and big data, using artificial intelligence deep learning and other algorithms to screen and integrate images and clinical features for modeling and diagnosis, which may further improve the efficacy of staging and response evaluation theoretically. In this paper, we focused on gastro-radiology and radiomics, and reviewed five dimensions progressively: (1) As the first choice for staging and response evaluation, CT application is limited by radiologists' ability to excavate image features and information integration, which needs more powerful image processing method. (2) Radiomics texture analysis can provide massive objective image information that can not be identified by the radiologists' naked eye. It is more detailed and provides quantitative evaluation of the characteristics of tumors better than the radiologists' subjective vision analysis, which can dig potential microscopic information. In the recent two years, the research on the application has been progressing rapidly, covering almost all the solid tumors, and solving the various clinical focuses using entropy, skewness, heterogeneity and other texture analysis indicators. (3) The research progress of radiomics in gastric cancer from the following three directions was summarized: differential diagnosis and biological behavior analysis, staging, and response prediction and evaluation. The current research confirmed the high efficiency of radiomics and texture analysis in differentiating different types, stages and responders of gastric cancer, which can act at least as an important supplement for the subjective evaluation of the radiologists.(4) The congenital defects of radiomics and the current problems on research were summarized, in order to avoid misuse and pitfalls. (5) The radiologists need not to worry about being replaced in the expectation of the future AI radiomics; on the contrary, AI radiomics will be a good assistant. The radiologist should actively take part in the MDT and cooperate with multi-center colleagues to promote the development of large data radiomics in gastric cancer.", "The types of reading difficulties experienced by children are highly heterogeneous in nature, which makes diagnosis and intervention difficult. Over the past 30 years, there has been much debate over the cause of dyslexia. The two most popular theories for phonological deficits in dyslexia are the rate-processing constraint hypothesis, which relates to short timescale processing, and the temporal sampling framework hypothesis, which relates to longer timescale processing.\nTo investigate the relationship between sublexical (i.e., nonword) reading skills and auditory spectral and temporal resolution patterns in children with reading difficulties using the Phoneme Identification Test (PIT) and the Parsing Syllable Envelopes Test (ParSE). These tests were developed to assess the rate-processing constraint and the temporal sampling framework hypotheses, respectively. We hypothesized that a proportion of children who have sublexical reading difficulties may have an underlying auditory-resolution deficit which may impact their ability to form letter-sound correspondences. We predicted that children's sublexical reading difficulties may not be explained by one theory, but instead that both theories may describe different types of reading difficulties found in different children. We also hypothesized that children with lexical (i.e., irregular word) reading difficulties but intact sublexical reading skills would not show atypical results on PIT or ParSE.\nBehavioral experimental clinical study with children who have reading difficulties.\nSixteen children with nonword, irregular word, or mixed reading difficulties diagnosed by the Castles and Coltheart Test 2.\nChildren completed a test battery consisting of a hearing screen and tests of reading, auditory resolution, phonological awareness, attention, spatial auditory processing, auditory memory, and intelligence. Categorization and correlational analyses were conducted.\nAll four children with a pure sublexical reading deficit also had an auditory-resolution deficit. Four of seven children with a mixed reading deficit had an auditory-resolution deficit. Only one of five children with a lexical reading deficit had an auditory-resolution deficit. Individual children's specific deficits were related to either rate processing (n = 5) or temporal sampling (n = 4), but never both. Children's nonword reading scores were strongly correlated with their performance on the PIT in noise, but not with the PIT in quiet or the ParSE. Children's irregular word scores were not significantly correlated with their performance on the PIT in quiet or in noise, or the ParSE, as hypothesized. Strong correlations were also found between children's nonword scores and their phonological awareness scores.\nThe results of this study suggest that neither the rate-processing hypothesis nor the temporal sampling framework is the single cause of reading difficulties in children. Instead, both of these hypotheses are likely to account for different types of reading deficits found in children. This is an important finding as the specific mechanisms driving different reading impairments must be identified to create tools to better diagnose and treat different types of reading difficulties. Further investigation of the PIT and ParSE as potential diagnostic tools for specific auditory-resolution-based reading difficulties in a larger group of children is currently underway.", "Physically transient electronic devices that can disappear on demand have great application prospects in the field of information security, implantable biomedical systems, and environment friendly electronics. On the other hand, the memristor-based artificial synapse is a promising candidate for new generation neuromorphic computing systems in artificial intelligence applications. Therefore, a physically transient synapse based on memristors is highly desirable for security neuromorphic computing and bio-integrated systems. Here, this is the first presentation of fully degradable biomimetic synaptic devices based on a W/MgO/ZnO/Mo memristor on a silk protein substrate, which show remarkable information storage and synaptic characteristics including long-term potentiation (LTP), long-term depression (LTD) and spike timing dependent plasticity (STDP) behaviors. Moreover, to emulate the apoptotic process of biological neurons, the transient synapse devices can be dissolved completely in phosphate-buffered saline solution (PBS) or deionized (DI) water in 7 min. This work opens the route to security neuromorphic computing for smart security and defense electronic systems, as well as for neuro-medicine and implantable electronic systems.", "Down syndrome (DS) is a population with known hippocampal impairment, with studies showing that individuals with DS display difficulties in spatial navigation and remembering arbitrary bindings. Recent research has also demonstrated the importance of the hippocampus for novel word-learning. Based on these data, we aimed to determine whether individuals with DS show deficits in learning new labels and if they may benefit from encoding conditions thought to be less reliant on hippocampal function (i.e., through fast mapping).\nIn the current study, we examined immediate, 5-min, and 1-week delayed word-learning across two learning conditions (e.g., explicit encoding vs. fast mapping). These conditions were examined across groups (twenty-six 3- to 5-year-old typically developing children and twenty-six 11- to 28-year-old individuals with DS with comparable verbal and nonverbal scores on the Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test - second edition) and in reference to sleep quality.\nBoth individuals with and without DS showed retention after a 1-week delay, and the current study found no benefit of the fast mapping condition in either group contrary to our expectations. Eye tracking data showed that preferential eye movements to target words were not present immediately but emerged after 1-week in both groups. Furthermore, sleep measures collected via actigraphy did not relate to retention in either group.\nThis study presents novel data on long-term knowledge retention in reference to sleep patterns in DS and adds to a body of knowledge helping us to understand the processes of word-learning in typical and atypically developing populations. (JINS, 2018, 24, 955-965).", "Decisions regarding provision of intensive care and post-discharge follow-up for infants born extremely preterm (<28 weeks' gestation) are based on the risks of mortality and neurodevelopmental disability. We aimed to elucidate the changes in probability of three outcomes (death, survival with major disability, and survival without major disability) with postnatal age in extremely preterm infants offered intensive care, and the effect of postnatal events on the probability of survival without major disability.\nIn this prospective observational study, we used data from three geographical cohorts composed of all extremely preterm livebirths offered intensive care at birth during three distinct periods (1991-92, 1997, and 2005) in Victoria, Australia. Participants were assessed at 8 years' corrected age for major neurodevelopmental disability, defined as moderate or severe cerebral palsy, general intelligence more than 2 SDs below term-born control means, blindness, or deafness. Probabilities of outcomes conditional on survival to different postnatal ages were calculated by logistic regression. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess factors predictive of survival with major disability.\n751 (82%) of 915 extremely preterm livebirths free of lethal anomalies were offered intensive care, of whom 546 (73%) survived to age 8 years. Of the 499 survivors assessed, 86 (17%) had a major disability. With increasing gestational age at birth or days of postnatal survival, the probability of death decreased and of survival without major disability increased. By contrast, the probability of survival with major disability varied little with gestational age or postnatal survival. In survivors, major disability was associated with the occurrence of four important postnatal events: grade 3 or 4 intraventricular haemorrhage (odds ratio 2\u00b761 [95% CI 1\u00b711-6\u00b715]), cystic periventricular leukomalacia (9\u00b717 [3\u00b757-23\u00b753]), postnatal corticosteroid use (1\u00b799 [1\u00b703-3\u00b785]), and surgery (2\u00b778 [1\u00b751-5\u00b713]). 241 survivors (48%) had no major postnatal events during the newborn period, and had the lowest prevalence of major disability (17 participants [7%]). The probability of survival without major disability decreased with increasing number of major events (0\u00b793 [0\u00b789-0\u00b796] for no events vs 0\u00b731 [0\u00b711-0\u00b759] for three or more events).\nLong-term prognosis in terms of death and major neurodevelopmental disability changes rapidly after birth for extremely preterm infants. Counselling of families and post-discharge planning should be individualised to changing circumstances following birth.\nNational Health and Medical Research Council of Australia.", "The first CT scanners in the early 1970s already used iterative reconstruction algorithms; however, lack of computational power prevented their clinical use. In fact, it took until 2009 for the first iterative reconstruction algorithms to come commercially available and replace conventional filtered back projection. Since then, this technique has caused a true hype in the field of radiology. Within a few years, all major CT vendors introduced iterative reconstruction algorithms for clinical routine, which evolved rapidly into increasingly advanced reconstruction algorithms. The complexity of algorithms ranges from hybrid-, model-based to fully iterative algorithms. As a result, the number of scientific publications on this topic has skyrocketed over the last decade. But what exactly has this technology brought us so far? And what can we expect from future hardware as well as software developments, such as photon-counting CT and artificial intelligence? This paper will try answer those questions by taking a concise look at the overall evolution of CT image reconstruction and its clinical implementations. Subsequently, we will give a prospect towards future developments in this domain. KEY POINTS: \u2022 Advanced CT reconstruction methods are indispensable in the current clinical setting. \u2022 IR is essential for photon-counting CT, phase-contrast CT, and dark-field CT. \u2022 Artificial intelligence will potentially further increase the performance of reconstruction methods.", "Due to the rapid installation of a massive number of fixed and mobile sensors, monitoring machines are intentionally or unintentionally involved in the production of a large amount of geospatial data. Environmental sensors and related software applications are rapidly altering human lifestyles and even impacting ecological and human health. However, there are rarely specific geospatial sensor web (GSW) applications for certain ecological public health questions. In this paper, we propose an ontology-driven approach for integrating intelligence to manage human and ecological health risks in the GSW. We design a Human and Ecological health Risks Ontology (HERO) based on a semantic sensor network ontology template. We also illustrate a web-based prototype, the Human and Ecological Health Risk Management System (HaEHMS), which helps health experts and decision makers to estimate human and ecological health risks. We demonstrate this intelligent system through a case study of automatic prediction of air quality and related health risk.", "This study evaluated effect of mental rotation (MR) training on learning outcomes and explored effectiveness of teaching via three-dimensional (3D) software among medical students with diverse spatial intelligence. Data from n = 67 student volunteers were included. A preliminary test was conducted to obtain baseline level of MR competency and was utilized to assign participants to two experimental conditions, i.e., trained group (n = 25) and untrained group (n = 42). Data on the effectiveness of training were collected to measure participants' speed and accuracy in performing various MR activities. Six weeks later, a large class format (LCF) session was conducted for all students using 3D software. The usefulness of technology-assisted learning at the LCF was evaluated via a pre- and post-test. Students' feedback regarding MR training and use of 3D software was acquired through questionnaires. MR scores of the trainees improved from 25.9\u00b14.6 points to 28.1\u00b14.4 (P = 0.011) while time taken to complete the tasks reduced from 20.9\u00b13.9 to 12.2\u00b14.4 minutes. Males scored higher than females in all components (P = 0.016). Further, higher pre- and post-test scores were observed in trained (9.0\u00b11.9 and 12.3\u00b11.6) versus untrained group (7.8\u00b11.8; 10.8\u00b11.8). Although mixed-design analysis of variance suggested significant difference in their test scores (P < 0.001), both groups reported similar trend in improvement by means of 3D software (P = 0.54). Ninety-seven percent of students reported technology-assisted learning as an effective means of instruction and found use of 3D software superior to plastic models. Software based on 3D technologies could be adopted as an effective teaching pedagogy to support learning across students with diverse levels of mental rotation abilities.", "Psychometric and emotional intelligence are considered as two separate theoretical constructs, although each one has been found to correlate to a certain degree with measures of creativity. The aim of the present study was to analyze whether individual differences such as age and gender, together with psychometric intelligence and emotional competence (EC) predicted creativity. We selected a sample of 376 participants aged 12-88 (mean age = 30.28 years, SD = 19.09 years; 224 females) to evaluate relationships between these constructs across lifespan. Participants were administered the Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test-2, the Short Profile of EC, the Creativity Style Questionnaire Revised (CSQ-R) and the Creative Achievement Questionnaire (CAQ). T-test on gender differences evidenced that males had higher creativity achievements compared to females. A path analysis was applied to examine the relationships between the CAQ and CSQ-R scores as dependent variables and the potential predictors assessed. Results showed that CSQ-R was significantly predicted by interpersonal emotional competence and marginally by educational level (p = 0.058) and intrapersonal emotional competence (p = 0.051). On the other hand, the CAQ score was significantly predicted by gender, age, and composite IQ. Discussion is focused on possible theoretical implications.", "To determine the neuropsychological abnormalities that occur in alternating hemiplegia of childhood (AHC) and report on our experience in managing them.\nPatients underwent evaluations according to our standardized AHC pathway. Data were entered into our prospective AHC database and then analyzed.\nOf the cohort of 25 consecutive patients (ages 15mo-42y), eight had initial chief complaints about cognition, 14 language, five attention, and 11 behavior. As compared to population norms means, neuropsychological and behavioral assessment tools (including Child Behavior Checklist, Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, Peabody Picture Vocabulary, and Wechsler Intelligence Quotient tests) showed significant impairments in multiple domains: cognition, expressive and receptive language, executive function/attention, and behavior (p<0.05 in all comparisons). Evaluations generated management recommendations in all patients. Twenty had neuropsychiatric diagnoses: 10 attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), seven disruptive behavior, and three anxiety disorder. Eight out of nine patients with ADHD who were prescribed medications responded to pharmacotherapy.\nPatients with AHC have developmental difficulties related to impairments in multiple neuropsychological domains. This supports the hypothesis that the underlying AHC pathophysiology involves diffuse neuronal dysfunction. Testing generated recommendations to help manage these difficulties. Patients with AHC also have a range of neuropsychiatric diagnoses, the most common being ADHD which responds to pharmacotherapy.\nPatients with alternating hemiplegia of childhood (AHC) have developmental difficulties with underlying neuropsychological impairments. The findings in this study are consistent with an underlying AHC pathophysiology which involves diffuse neuronal, probably largely GABAergic, dysfunction.

Zoonotic & Emerging program signals with first rating occurring between January 1, 2016 and December 31, 2017 were included. Krippendorff's alpha was used to estimate inter-rater reliability between users. A z-test was used to identify whether users tended to rate within 95% confidence interval (versus outside) the average community rating.\nThe 37 users who rated signals represented 20 organizations. 27.0% (n = 10) of users rated \u226510% of all rated signals, and their inter-rater reliability estimate was 72.4% (95% CI: 66.5-77.9%). Five users tended to rate significantly outside of the average community rating. An average user rated 58.4% of the time within the signal's 95% CI. All users who significantly rated within the average community rating rated outside the 95% CI at least once.\nA diverse community of raters participated in rating the signals. Krippendorff's Alpha estimate revealed moderate reliability for users who rated \u226510% of signals. It was observed that inter-rater reliability increased for users with more experience rating signals.\nDiversity was observed between user ratings. It is hypothesized that rating diversity is influenced by differences in user expertise and experience, and that the number of times a user rates within and outside of a signal's 95% CI can be used as a proxy for user expertise. The introduction of a weighted rating algorithm within KIWI that takes this into consideration could be beneficial.", "Surveillance for surgical site infections (SSIs) after ambulatory surgery in children requires a detailed manual chart review to assess criteria defined by the National Health and Safety Network (NHSN). Electronic health records (EHRs) impose an inefficient search process where infection preventionists must manually review every postsurgical encounter (< 30 days). Using text mining and business intelligence software, we developed an information foraging application, the SSI Workbench, to visually present which postsurgical encounters included SSI-related terms and synonyms, antibiotic, and culture orders.\nThis article compares the Workbench and EHR on four dimensions: (1) effectiveness, (2) efficiency, (3) workload, and (4) usability.\nComparative usability test of Workbench and EHR. Objective test metrics are time per case, encounters reviewed per case, time per encounter, and retrieval of information meeting NHSN definitions. Subjective measures are cognitive load using the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Task Load Index (NASA TLX), and a questionnaire on system usability and utility.\nEight infection preventionists participated in the test. There was no difference in effectiveness as subjects retrieved information from all cases, using both systems, to meet the NHSN criteria. There was no difference in efficiency in time per case between the Workbench and EHR (8.58 vs. 7.39 minutes, p\u2009=\u20090.36). However, with the Workbench subjects opened fewer encounters per case (3.0 vs. 7.5, p\u2009=\u20090.002), spent more time per encounter (2.23 vs. 0.92 minutes, p\u2009=\u20090.002), rated the Workbench lower in cognitive load (NASA TLX, 24 vs. 33, p\u2009=\u20090.02), and significantly higher in measures of usability.\nCompared with the EHR, the Workbench was more usable, short, and reduced cognitive load. In overall efficiency, the Workbench did not save time, but demonstrated a shift from between-encounter foraging to within-encounter foraging and was rated as significantly more efficient. Our results suggest that infection surveillance can be better supported by systems applying information foraging theory.", "Intelligence in minimally verbal children on the autism spectrum (AS) is at risk of being underestimated. The present study investigated testability and cognitive profile of preschool autistic children using conventional tools and strength-informed tools. Fifty-two AS children and fifty-four typical children matched on age (31-77 months) were assessed. Testability increased with age in both groups, was generally lower in AS children, but not related to their test performance. Typical children performed significantly better than AS children on conventional tools, but performance of both groups was similar on strength-informed tools. Differences of performance across tests were much greater in the AS group. These results emphasize the heterogenous, yet characteristic, cognitive profile in preschool children, and introduce the usefulness of flexible testing.", "The ability of intelligent agents to play games in human-like fashion is popularly considered a benchmark of progress in Artificial Intelligence. In our work, we introduce the first computational model aimed at Pictionary, the popular word-guessing social game. We first introduce Sketch-QA, a guessing task. Styled after Pictionary, Sketch-QA uses incrementally accumulated sketch stroke sequences as visual data. Sketch-QA involves asking a fixed question (\"What object is being drawn?\") and gathering open-ended guess-words from human guessers. We analyze the resulting dataset and present many interesting findings therein. To mimic Pictionary-style guessing, we propose a deep neural model which generates guess-words in response to temporally evolving human-drawn object sketches. Our model even makes human-like mistakes while guessing, thus amplifying the human mimicry factor. We evaluate our model on the large-scale guess-word dataset generated via Sketch-QA task and compare with various baselines. We also conduct a Visual Turing Test to obtain human impressions of the guess-words generated by humans and our model. Experimental results demonstrate the promise of our approach for Pictionary and similarly themed games.", "Previous studies suggested likely mechanisms underlying the dysfunction of the default mode network (DMN) in schizophrenia. However, altered patterns of the intrinsic activity of the DMN in both deficit schizophrenia (DS) and non-deficit schizophrenia (NDS) patients, as well as the neurocognitive relationships among them, remain unknown. This study explores the resting-state characteristics of the DMN activity in both DS and NDS patients, and further investigates correlations with neurocognitive features.\nDemographic, resting-state functional MRI, and neurocognitive data were collected in 37 DS and 38 NDS patients, as well as in 38 matched healthy control subjects (HCs). Independent component analysis was conducted to investigate the characteristics of DMN activity and to further distinguish between common and specific altered regions. In addition, partial correlation analysis was conducted to examine associations between the activity of altered regions and neurocognitive assessments.\nOverlapping altered brain activity was observed in both DS and NDS patients in the left middle frontal gyrus (MFG), the left angular gyrus (ANG), and the calcarine sulcus (CAL) region. Furthermore, compared to HCs, DS patients showed less activity in the right inferior temporal gyrus, the right para-hippocampal gyrus / hippocampus (PHP / HIP), and the left precuneus (PCUN), while they showed increased activity in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC). Notably, NDS patients showed less activity in the bilateral middle occipital gyrus. Correlation analysis indicated that, in the DS group, both Trail Making Test (TMT)-B and spatial processing scores were positively associated with the activities of the left PCUN and the right PHP / HIP, while the Stroop color scores were negatively associated with PCC activity. In the NDS group, the TMT-B scores were associated with activities of the left MFG and CAL regions, while the scores of the Wechsler adult intelligence scale (Chinese revision) were negatively associated with CAL region activity.\nThe present study demonstrates convergent and divergent altered patterns of the DMN in both DS and NDS patients. Importantly, the specific altered regions of the DMN in DS patients may be associated with extensive deficient neurocognition, indicating novel insights into the pathogenesis of cognitive impairment in schizophrenia.", "Human intelligence relies on the vast number of neurons and their interconnections that form a parallel computing engine. If we tend to design a brain-like machine, we will have no choice but to employ many spiking neurons, each one has a large number of synapses. Such a neuronal network is not only compute-intensive but also memory-intensive. The performance and the configurability of the modern FPGAs make them suitable hardware solutions to deal with these challenges. This paper presents a scalable architecture to simulate a randomly connected network of Hodgkin-Huxley neurons. To demonstrate that our architecture eliminates the need to use a high-end device, we employ the XC7A200T, a member of the mid-range Xilinx Artix\u00ae-7 family, as our target device. A set of techniques are proposed to reduce the memory usage and computational requirements. Here we introduce a multi-core architecture in which each core can update the states of a group of neurons stored in its corresponding memory bank. The proposed system uses a novel method to generate the connectivity vectors on the fly instead of storing them in a huge memory. This technique is based on a cyclic permutation of a single prestored connectivity vector per core. Moreover, to reduce both the resource usage and the computational latency even more, a novel approximate two-level counter is introduced to count the number of the spikes at the synapse for the sparse network. The first level is a low cost saturated counter implemented on FPGA lookup tables that reduces the number of inputs to the second level exact adder tree. It, therefore, results in much lower hardware cost for the counter circuit. These techniques along with pipelining make it possible to have a high-performance, scalable architecture, which could be configured for either a real-time simulation of up to 5120 neurons or a large-scale simulation of up to 65536 neurons in an appropriate execution time on a cost-optimized FPGA.", "The diagnostic importance of audio signal characteristics in needle electromyography (EMG) is well established. Given the recent advent of audio-sound identification by artificial intelligence, we hypothesized that the extraction of characteristic resting EMG signals and application of machine learning algorithms could help classify various EMG discharges.\nData files of 6 classes of resting EMG signals were divided into 2-s segments. Extraction of characteristic features (384 and 4,367 features each) was used to classify the 6 types of discharges using machine learning algorithms.\nAcross 841 audio files, the best overall accuracy of 90.4% was observed for the smaller feature set. Among the feature classes, mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC)-related features were useful in correct classification.\nWe showed that needle EMG resting signals were satisfactorily classifiable by the combination of feature extraction and machine learning, and this can be applied to clinical settings.

A decision tool was subsequently developed for hospital managers to test different scenarios.\nSimulation modelling showed that significant bed occupancy levelling could be achieved through small and practicable changes to the MSS. Optimisation routines conducted using the simulation model then gave additional insights into how the schedule should be revamped for the long term.\nThe authors show how operations research methods are useful for guiding hospital operational planning. The authors show that a data-driven and evidence-based model enables hospital managers to critically explore various scheduling changes, while also providing a scientific common ground for discussion among important stakeholders. It is a crucial step forward when adopting advanced analytics for Hong Kong hospital operational planning.\nThe authors provide a robust method for evaluating the relationship between Hong Kong hospital's MSS and its bed occupancy. Through simulating various changes to the surgical schedule, valuable and practicable insights were made available for hospital managers to make short- and longer-term changes that enhance the system's overall efficiency and service quality.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) is profoundly changing biotechnological innovation.

It is a technique that is instrumental in biomedical research and healthcare. Its longevity lies in its preciseness in mechanical retrieval, or delivery of biological materials, which in some cases is simply necessary or more effective than other retrieval/delivery means. Microinjection is favored for its straightforwardness in transferring contents from micromolecules to macromolecules and from organelles to cells. Microinjection/micromanipulation has been practiced over the century like an art form. Variations in handlings and instruments can be tolerated to a surprising degree with satisfactory outcomes. Throughout the century, microinjection developed as an indispensable tool along with the evolution of biomedical fields: from transgenics to gene targeting, from animal cloning to human infertility treatment, from nuclease-guided genetic engineering to RNA-guided genome editing (Fig. 1). The birth of the CRISPRology rejuvenated microinjection. For microinjection/micromanipulation, the second century has already begun with the early arrival of computerized instrumentation and lately of the high-throughput nanomanipulators potentially operable by artificial intelligence. As we yin-yang both systemic and precision approaches in research and medicine, microinjection will no doubt continue to find its unique place in the future.", "We determine an optimal injection pattern for anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and for the combination of anti-VEGF and unlicensed dendritic cells.\nWe rely on the mathematical model of Soto-Ortiz and Finley (2016) for the interactions between the tumor growth, angiogenesis and immune system reactions. Our optimization algorithm belongs to the class of Monte-Carlo tree search algorithms. The objective consists in finding the minimal total drug doses for which an injection pattern yields tumor eradication.\nOur results are twofold. First, optimized injection protocols enable to significantly reduce the total drug dose for tumor elimination. For instance, for an early diagnosis date, a total dose equal to 58% of the standard anti-VEGF dose enables to eliminate the tumor. In the case of drug combination, associating 25% of the total standard anti-VEGF dose to 10% of the dendritic cell total standard dose eradicates tumor. Our second result is that administering a dose equal to the maximal standard dose allows for later diagnosis date compared to standard protocol. For instance, in the case of anti-VEGF injection, the optimal protocol postpones the maximal diagnosis date by more than one month.\nOverall, our optimization based on artificial intelligence delivers significant gains in total drug administration or in the length of the therapeutic window. Our method is flexible and could be adapted to other drug combinations.", "This study explores the use of tests to select police officers in Massachusetts from 1967-1979. I show how a range of actors understood the construction of merit within the context of police selection in Boston during the Civil Rights movement and how these debates raised larger questions about objectivity in the social sciences and the law. I argue that when experts exposed the way seemingly objective \"intelligence\" tests perpetuated racial inequality, the public rejected their expertise, instead reaffirming their trust in tests as the best way to evaluate merit and by instead challenging the law's objectivity. This paper puts histories of merit in conversation with scholarship on affirmative action and employment discrimination to provide a fuller understanding of how intelligence tests are constructed and how nonexpert actors interpreted debates about testing, defining and redefining merit in ways that reflected their beliefs about race, opportunity, and employment.", "Recent research suggests that a negative relationship exists between adiposity and cognitive function in children. However, limited information is known on how they are related. This study aimed to examine the mediators of the relationship between overweight/obesity and cognitive function among school children in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.\nThis is a cross-sectional comparison study whereby 225 overweight/obese children matched for age, sex, and ethnicity with 225 normal weight children participated in this study. Body image dissatisfaction, disordered eating, and depressive symptoms were assessed through a self-administered questionnaire. Blood pressure was measured, whereas blood was drawn to determine insulin, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), glucose, and lipid profiles. Homeostasis model assessment-estimated insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was calculated using glucose and insulin levels. Wechsler's Intelligence Scale for Children-Fourth Edition (WISC-IV) was used to assess cognitive function in children. Ordinary least square regression analysis was conducted to determine the direct and indirect relationships between weight status and cognitive function.\nA negative relationship was found between overweight/obesity with cognitive function. Overweight/obese children were on average 4.075 units lower in cognitive function scores compared to normal weight children. Such difference was found through mediators, such as body image dissatisfaction, disordered eating, depression, systolic blood pressure, triglycerides, HOMA-IR, and hs-CRP, contributing 22.2% of the variances in cognitive function in children.\nResults highlight the important mediators of the relationship between overweight/obesity and cognitive function. Consequently, future interventions should target to improve psychological well-being and reduce cardiovascular disease risk for the prevention of poorer cognitive performance in overweight/obese children.", "Students' gaining and adopting basic professional values, improving their emotional intelligence skills during the process of nursing education plays a significant role on meeting the needs of healthy/patient individual and his or her family, and individualized care practices.\nThis (descriptive, correlational) research was carried out to evaluate the nursing values, emotional intelligence levels, and individualized care perceptions of senior nursing students and to determine the relationship between them.\n(1) What is the status of students to adopt nursing values? (2) What is the level of students' emotional intelligence? (3) What is the students' individualized care perception? (4) Is there a relationship between students' nursing values, levels of emotional intelligence, and individualized perceptions of care?\nThe research was carried out with 218 senior nursing students at the Faculty of Nursing, affiliated to a state university in Istanbul, who agreed to participate in the study, completing basic nursing education in May 2017.\nEthical approval for this study was obtained from the Ethics Committee of Clinical Investigations of the Istanbul University Dentistry Faculty. Written permission was also obtained from the institution that research would be conducted. Before the data were collected, verbal permission was obtained by the investigator.\nIt was observed that nursing values perceptions of students, emotional intelligence levels and individualized care perceptions were at a good level and there was a supportive relationship between them in the positive direction. It was determined that emotional intelligence skills of students, adoption of nursing values and individualized care perceptions increased in parallel with each other.\nIn nursing education, nursing values peculiar to affective field, caring behaviors, and emotional intelligence skills that are guiding to maintain and direct these behaviors should be gained to students by supporting with correct learning methods and role models.", "Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) has emerged as an effective brain monitoring technique to measure the hemodynamic response of the cortical surface. Its wide popularity and adoption in recent time attribute to its portability, ease of use, and flexibility in multimodal studies involving electroencephalography. While fNIRS is still emerging on various fronts including hardware, software, algorithm, and applications, it still requires overcoming several scientific challenges associated with brain monitoring in naturalistic environments where the human participants are allowed to move and required to perform various tasks stimulating brain behaviors. In response to these challenges and demands, we have developed a wearable fNIRS system, WearLight that was built upon an Internet-of-Things embedded architecture for onboard intelligence, configurability, and data transmission. In addition, we have pursued detailed research and comparative analysis on the design of the optodes encapsulating an near-infrared light source and a detector into 3-D printed material. We performed rigorous experimental studies on human participants to test reliability, signal-to-noise ratio, and configurability. Most importantly, we observed that WearLight has a capacity to measure hemodynamic responses in various setups including arterial occlusion on the forearm and frontal lobe brain activity during breathing exercises in a naturalistic environment. Our promising experimental results provide an evidence of preliminary clinical validation of WearLight. This encourages us to move toward intensive studies involving brain monitoring.", "The toxic effects of prenatal methylmercury (MeHg) include neurological abnormalities and developmental delay of which infants and children are particular susceptible. Studies on the effects of low and moderate exposure show conflicting results. Seafood is the main dietary source of MeHg, but also contributes with nutrients regarded as beneficial for development.\nTo measure the change in total hair mercury concentration (THHg) after an intervention of lunch meals with fatty fish or meat in Norwegian preschool children, and to examine the associations between THHg and cognitive function.\nChildren (n\u202f=\u202f232) 4-6\u202fyears old were randomized to lunch meals with fatty fish (n\u202f=\u202f114) or meat (n\u202f=\u202f118) three times a week for 16\u202fweeks. THHg was determined using a Direct Mercury Analyzer, and cognitive function was assessed by the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Intelligence Scale-III (WPPSI-III) pre- and post-intervention. Linear mixed effect models were used to analyze changes in THHg and WPPSI-III scores.\nThe mean (SD) THHg pre-intervention was 0.373 (0.204) mg\u202fkg-1. Children in the fish group had an increase in THHg (change 0.162, 95% CI 0.111, 0.213\u202fmg\u202fkg-1), whereas children in the meat group had decreased THHg (-0.053, 95% CI -0.103, -0.002\u202fmg\u202fkg-1). There were no notable associations between THHg and the WPPSI-III raw scores at baseline or after 16\u202fweeks of the fish/meat intervention.\nLunch meals including fatty fish led to a significant increase in THHg, but the values remain below the point of departures used for risk assessment by the EFSA, WHO and US-EPA. We observed no associations between THHg and cognitive function.", "The goals of the present study were to test whether (and which) basic numerical abilities can be improved with training and whether training effects transfer to improvement in children's math achievement. The literature is mixed with evidence that does or does not substantiate the efficacy of training basic numerical ability. In the present study, we developed a child-friendly software named \"123 Bakery\" which includes four training modules; non-symbolic numerosity comparison, non-symbolic numerosity estimation, approximate arithmetic, and symbol-to-numerosity mapping. Fifty-six first graders were randomly assigned to either the training or control group. The training group participated in 6 weeks of training (5 times a week, 30 minutes per day). All participants underwent pre- and post-training assessment of their basic numerical processing ability (including numerosity discrimination acuity, symbolic/non-symbolic magnitude estimation, approximate arithmetic, and symbol-to-numerosity mapping), overall math achievement and intelligence, 6 weeks apart. The acuity for numerosity discrimination (approximate number sense acuity; hereafter ANS acuity) significantly improved after training, but this training effect did not transfer to improvement in symbolic, exact calculation, or any other math ability. We conclude that basic numerical cognition training leads to improvement in ANS acuity, but whether this effect transfers to symbolic math ability remains to be further tested.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) based on deep learning (DL) has sparked tremendous global interest in recent years. DL has been widely adopted in image recognition, speech recognition and natural language processing, but is only beginning to impact on healthcare. In ophthalmology, DL has been applied to fundus photographs, optical coherence tomography and visual fields, achieving robust classification performance in the detection of diabetic retinopathy and retinopathy of prematurity, the glaucoma-like disc, macular oedema and age-related macular degeneration. DL in ocular imaging may be used in conjunction with telemedicine as a possible solution to screen, diagnose and monitor major eye diseases for patients in primary care and community settings. Nonetheless, there are also potential challenges with DL application in ophthalmology, including clinical and technical challenges, explainability of the algorithm results, medicolegal issues, and physician and patient acceptance of the AI 'black-box' algorithms. DL could potentially revolutionise how ophthalmology is practised in the future. This review provides a summary of the state-of-the-art DL systems described for ophthalmic applications, potential challenges in clinical deployment and the path forward.", "Deep Learning (DL) networks are recent revolutionary developments in artificial intelligence research. Typical networks are stacked by groups of layers that are further composed of many convolutional kernels or neurons. In network design, many hyper-parameters need to be defined heuristically before training in order to achieve high cross-validation accuracies. However, accuracy evaluation from the output layer alone is not sufficient to specify the roles of the hidden units in associated networks. This results in a significant knowledge gap between DL's wider applications and its limited theoretical understanding. To narrow the knowledge gap, our study explores visualization techniques to illustrate the mutual information (MI) in DL networks. The MI is a theoretical measurement, reflecting the relationship between two sets of random variables even if their relationship is highly non-linear and hidden in high-dimensional data. Our study aims to understand the roles of DL units in classification performance of the networks. Via a series of experiments using several popular DL networks, it shows that the visualization of MI and its change patterns between the input/output with the hidden layers and basic units can facilitate a better understanding of these DL units' roles. Our investigation on network convergence suggests a more objective manner to potentially evaluate DL networks. Furthermore, the visualization provides a useful tool to gain insights into the network performance, and thus to potentially facilitate the design of better network architectures by identifying redundancy and less-effective network units.", "Cognitive function performance decreases in older individuals compared to young adults. To curb this decline, cognitive training is applied, but it is not clear whether it improves only the trained task or also other cognitive functions. To investigate this, we considered an N-back working memory (WM) training task and verified whether it improves both trained WM and untrained cognitive functions.\nAs EEG studies have noted task difficulty and age-related changes in time-locked EEG responses, called event-related potentials (ERPs), we focused on the relation between the P300 ERP component, task difficulty level, and behavior response accuracy and reaction time (RT) in young and older healthy adults. We used two groups of young and older healthy participants to assess the effect of N-back training: cognitive training group (CTG) and passive control group (PCG). Before and after training, cognitive tests were administered to both groups to evaluate transfer effects.\nDespite the observed age-related differences in the P300 ERP component and in terms of RT and accuracy, our findings demonstrate a stronger improvement in the trained task for older CTGs compared to younger CTGs, larger near- and far-transfer effect to WM and fluid intelligence for both younger and older CTGs, and a far-transfer effect to attention but only for older adults. Significant differences in response accuracy were shown between young and older subjects in spatial memory and attention tests.\nThe application of a WM training is a promising tool for both healthy adults, and in particular for older subjects, as it showed physiological and behavioral differences in cognitive plasticity across life span and evidence of benefits in the trained task and near-/far-transfer effects to other cognitive functions.", "The primary objective of this study was to identify characteristics of pharmacists that contribute to their success.\nA working definition of success in pharmacy practice was derived from a scoping literature review and is based on the premise that successful pharmacists practice to full scope within the context of their practice setting. Semistructured individual interviews were conducted with selected pharmacists. Potential candidates were nominated by leading pharmacists in the field with the use of our prespecified definition of success. Lists from the nominators were compared, and pharmacists who appeared on more than 1 list were invited to participate. The interview tool was developed with the use of previous research on success in health care professions.\nParticipants were 10 practicing pharmacists in a variety of locations (5 urban/5 rural) and practice settings (5 hospital/4 community/1 ambulatory care).\nThemes related to successful pharmacists practicing to full scope.\nPharmacists meeting our definition of success were engaged in assessment and care planning, other expanded scope activities, and interpersonal activities and collaboration. The 10 interviewed pharmacists described motivation, critical thinking, emotional intelligence, core competencies, and work-life balance as significant contributors to their success.\nSeveral characteristics were identified as potentially related to success. These characteristics may be useful in pharmacists identifying areas for personal growth and development.", "Current research suggests that pediatric stroke is associated with a reduction in intellectual functioning. However, less is known about academic achievement and the contribution of specific executive functions to math and literacy in this population. The current study investigates behavioral ratings of executive functioning and their relationship to math and spelling performance in children with a history of unilateral arterial ischemic stroke.\nThirty-two pediatric patients with stroke (Mage\u00a0=\u00a09.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.7\u00a0years) and 32 demographically equivalent, healthy controls were tested on standardized measures of arithmetic, spelling, and intelligence. Executive functioning data were collected via standardized parent questionnaire.\nRelative to controls, stroke participants demonstrated significantly poorer functioning in math, spelling, metacognition, and behavioral-regulation. Pencil and paper arithmetic was particularly challenging for the stroke group, with 40% of patients reaching levels of clinical impairment. Hierarchical regression in stroke participants further revealed that metacognition was a robust predictor of academic deficits. Stroke occurring in later childhood and affecting cortical and subcortical brain regions also presented as potential clinical risk factors.\nChildren with stroke were especially vulnerable to math achievement deficits. Metacognition made a substantial contribution to academic achievement abilities among stroke patients, and results underscore the importance of early metacognitive skills in the completion of schoolwork. Results also emphasize that pediatric stroke patients are a heterogeneous group with regard to functioning and that there is value in examining standard score distributions of clinical participant samples.", "With the rapid development of artificial intelligence have come concerns about how machines will make moral decisions, and the major challenge of quantifying societal expectations about the ethical principles that should guide machine behaviour. To address this challenge, we deployed the Moral Machine, an online experimental platform designed to explore the moral dilemmas faced by autonomous vehicles. This platform gathered 40 million decisions in ten languages from millions of people in 233 countries and territories. Here we describe the results of this experiment. First, we summarize global moral preferences. Second, we document individual variations in preferences, based on respondents' demographics. Third, we report cross-cultural ethical variation, and uncover three major clusters of countries. Fourth, we show that these differences correlate with modern institutions and deep cultural traits. We discuss how these preferences can contribute to developing global, socially acceptable principles for machine ethics. All data used in this article are publicly available.", "We have been reliably informed by practitioners that police officers and intelligence officers across the world have started to use the Model Statement lie detection technique. In this article we introduce this technique. We describe why it works, report the empirical evidence that it works, and outline how to use it. Research examining the Model Statement only started recently and more research is required. We give suggestions for future research with the technique. The Model Statement technique is one of many recently developed verbal lie detection methods. We start this article with a short overview of the-in our view- most promising recent developments in verbal lie detection before turning our attention to the Model Statement technique.", "Hearing-impairment can lead to a\u00a0reduced quality of life and thus represents a\u00a0vulnerability factor for mental disorders.\nThis study represents the first psychiatric analysis of subjective quality of life and depression in people with hearing-impairment in Germany.\nThe patient group included 30\u00a0hearing-impaired participants (27\u00a0women, 3\u00a0men) with a current or previous mental disorder and/or psychiatric/psychotherapeutic treatment (age: mean, M\u202f=\u200949.67\u00a0years; standard deviation, SD\u202f=\u200913.54\u00a0years). The control group consisted of 22\u00a0hearing-impaired participants (16\u00a0women, 6\u00a0men) without mental disorders or treatment (age: M\u202f=\u200952.41\u00a0years, SD\u202f=\u200917.30\u00a0years). Besides sociodemographic variables, we registered onset/extent of the various hearing-impairments and hearing aid provision. Both groups underwent extensive diagnostic assessment comprising subjective functional impairment (Sheehan Disability Scale, SDS), health-related quality of life (SF-36 Health Survey), and depressive symptoms (Beck Depression Inventory, BDI-II).\nGroups did not differ significantly in terms of sociodemographic variables such as age, gender, or intelligence. Participants of the patient group had a\u00a0significantly greater subjective impairment, a\u00a0lower quality of life, and more pronounced symptoms of depression. The invasiveness of the hearing aid (i.\u202fe., cochlear implant) as well as the timepoint of hearing-impairment onset (postlingually) appear to serve as vulnerability factors for mental health problems in this group.\nOur results indicate that besides delivering high-quality acoustic care, practitioners should continuously check patients' requirements for psychosocial treatment due to a\u00a0loss of quality of life. The development of a\u00a0specific psychotherapeutic treatment for hearing-impaired clients requires additional research focused on protective and vulnerability factors which may influence the emergence of mental disorders in these patients.", "The two main branches associated with Artificial Intelligence (AI) in medicine are virtual and physical. The virtual component includes machine learning (ML) and algorithms, whereas physical AI includes medical devices and robots for delivering care. AI is used successfully in tumour segmentation, histopathological diagnosis, tracking tumour development, and prognosis prediction. CURATE.AI, developed at the National University of Singapore, is a platform that automatically decides the optimum dose of drugs for a durable response, allowing the patient to resume a completely normal life. With the involvement of technology multinationals, such as Google and Microsoft, in AI and healthcare in association with leading healthcare companies, the future of AI in healthcare looks very promising.", "Many individuals are concerned about the governance of machine learning systems and the prevention of algorithmic harms. The EU's recent General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has been seen as a core tool for achieving better governance of this area. While the GDPR does apply to the use of models in some limited situations, most of its provisions relate to the governance of personal data, while models have traditionally been seen as intellectual property. We present recent work from the information security literature around 'model inversion' and 'membership inference' attacks, which indicates that the process of turning training data into machine-learned systems is not one way, and demonstrate how this could lead some models to be legally classified as personal data. Taking this as a probing experiment, we explore the different rights and obligations this would trigger and their utility, and posit future directions for algorithmic governance and regulation.This article is part of the theme issue 'Governing artificial intelligence: ethical, legal, and technical opportunities and challenges'.", "The aims of this study were to evaluate longitudinal metabolite changes in traumatic brain injury (TBI) subjects and determine whether early magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) changes in discrete brain regions predict 1-year neuropsychological outcomes. Three-dimensional (3D) proton MRSI was performed in pediatric subjects with complicated mild (cMild), moderate, and severe injury, acutely (6-17 days) and 1-year post-injury along with neurological and cognitive testing. Longitudinal analysis found that in the cMild/Moderate group, all MRSI ratios from 12 regions returned to control levels at 1 year. In the severe group, only cortical gray matter regions fully recovered to control levels whereas N-acetylaspartate (NAA) ratios from the hemispheric white matter and subcortical regions remained statistically different from controls. A factor analysis reduced the data to two loading factors that significantly differentiated between TBI groups; one included acute regional NAA variables and another consisted of clinically observed variables (e.g., days in coma). Using scores calculated from the two loading factors in a logistic regression model, we found that the percent accuracy for classification of TBI groups was greatest for the dichotomized attention measure (93%), followed by Full Scale Intelligence Quotient at 91%, and the combined memory Z-score measure (90%). Using the acute basal ganglia NAA/creatine (Cr) ratio alone achieved a higher percent accuracy of 94.7% for the attention measure whereas the acute thalamic NAA/Cr ratio alone achieved a higher percent accuracy of 91.9% for the memory measure. These results support the conclusions that reduced NAA is an early indicator of tissue injury and that measurements from subcortical brain regions are more predictive of long-term cognitive outcome.", "Although the origin of self-referential consciousness is unknown, it can be argued that the instantiation of self-reference was the commencement of the living state as phenomenal experientiality. As self-referential cognition is demonstrated by all living organisms, life can be equated with the sustenance of cellular homeostasis in the continuous defense of 'self'. It is proposed that the epicenter of 'self' is perpetually embodied within the basic cellular form in which it was instantiated. Cognition-Based Evolution argues that all of biological and evolutionary development represents the perpetual autopoietic defense of self-referential basal cellular states of homeostatic preference. The means by which these states are attained and maintained is through self-referential measurement of information and its communication. The multicellular forms, either as biofilms or holobionts, represent the cellular attempt to achieve maximum states of informational distinction and energy efficiency through individual and collective means. In this frame, consciousness, self-consciousness and intelligence can be identified as forms of collective cellular phenotype directed towards the defense of fundamental cellular self-reference.", "Short-term effects of music stimulus on enhancement of cognitive functions in human brain are documented, however the underlying neural mechanisms in these cognitive effects are not well investigated. In this study, we have attempted to decipher the mechanisms involved in alterations of neural networks that lead to enhanced cognitive effects post-exposure to music. We have investigated the changes in Electroencephalography (EEG) power and functional connectivity of alpha band in resting state of the brain after exposure to Indian classical music. We have quantified the changes in functional connectivity by phase coherence, phase delay, and phase slope index analyses. Spatial mapping of functional connectivity dynamics thus obtained, on brain networks revealed reduced information flow in long-distance connections between frontal and parietal cortex, and between other cortical regions underpinning intelligence. Analyses also showed increased power in the prefrontal and occipital cortex. With these findings, we have developed a stimulus-mechanism-end effect based neuro-cognitive model that explains the music induced cognitive enhancement by a three-channel framework - (1) enhanced global efficiency of brain, (2) enhanced local neural efficiency at the prefrontal lobe, and (3) increased sustained attention. Results signify that music directly affects the cognitive system and leads to improved brain efficiency through well-defined mechanisms.", "Emotional intelligence (EI) has been frequently studied as a predictor of work criteria, but disparate approaches to defining and measuring EI have produced rather inconsistent findings. The conceptualization of EI as an ability to be measured with performance-based tests is by many considered the most appropriate approach, but only few tests developed in this tradition exist, and none of them is designed to specifically assess EI in the workplace. The present research introduces the Geneva Emotional Competence test (GECo)-a new ability EI test measuring emotion recognition (assessed using video clips of actors), emotion understanding, emotion regulation in oneself, and emotion management in others (all assessed with situational judgment items of work-related scenarios). For the situational judgment items, correct and incorrect response options were developed using established theories from the emotion and organizational field. Five studies (total N = 888) showed that all subtests had high measurement precision (as assessed with Item Response Theory), and correlated in expected ways with other EI tests, cognitive intelligence, personality, and demographic variables. Further, the GECo predicted performance in computerized assessment center tasks in a sample of professionals, and explained academic performance in students incrementally above another ability EI test. Because of its theory-based scoring, good psychometric properties, and focus on the workplace, the GECo represents a promising tool for studying the role of four major EI components in organizational outcomes.

Healthy older adults are considered functionally independent if they pass a short survey consisting of relatively simple daily activities, including grocery shopping and managing finances. We argue that aging research often has overlooked an important factor for long-term functional independence in a dynamic environment: adaptation for growth via learning new skills. Previous research has focused primarily on compensation and mitigating decline rather than growth. Given that adaptation for growth is at the core of intelligence, resilience, and neuroplasticity, we suggest that functional independence research with older adults could integrate adaptation for growth into the construct, following research on adolescent autonomy and emerging adulthood. After briefly reviewing research on functional independence and compensation in older adulthood, we offer suggestions to push forward gerontological research linking adaptation for growth and functional independence.", "The healthcare industry, and specifically the pharmacovigilance industry, recognizes the need to support the increasing amount of data received from individual case safety reports (ICSRs). To cope with this increase, more healthcare and qualified professionals are required to capture and evaluate the data. To address the evolving landscape, it will be necessary to embrace assistive technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) at scale. AI in the field of pharmacovigilance will possibly result in the transformation of the drug safety (DS) professional's daily work life and their career development. Celgene's Global Drug Safety and Risk Management (GDSRM) function has established a series of work activities to drive innovation across the pharmacovigilance value chain (Celgene Chrysalis Fact Sheet. https://www.celgene.com/newsroom/media-library/chrysalis-fact-sheet/, 2018). The development of AI in pharmacovigilance raises questions about the possible changes in DS professionals' lives, who may find themselves curious about their future roles in a workplace assisted by AI. We discuss the current state of pharmacovigilance and the DS professional, AI in pharmacovigilance and the potential skillsets a DS professional may require when working with AI. We also describe the results of research conducted at Celgene GDSRM. The objective of the research was to understand the thoughts of pharmacovigilance professionals about their jobs. These results are provided in the form of aggregated responses to interview questions based on a 12-part questionnaire [see the Electronic Supplementary Material (ESM)]. A sample of six DS professionals representing various areas of pharmacovigilance operations were asked a range of questions about their backgrounds, current roles and future expectations. The DS professionals interviewed were, overall, enthusiastic about their job roles potentially changing with AI enhancements. Interviewees suggested that AI would allow for pharmacovigilance resources, time, and skills to shift the work from a volume-based to a value-based focus. The results suggest that pharmacovigilance professionals wish to use their qualifications, skillsets and experience in work that provides more value for their efforts. Machine learning algorithms have the potential to enhance DS professionals' decision-making processes and support more efficient and accurate case processing.", "Purpose: To elucidate the association between developmental stage of human figure drawing(HFD) and fine motor control, visual perception, and further investigate its potential to be used for screening developmental delay. Methods: Participants were 301 children at 5\u00bd years of age, 176 born preterm and 125 at term, whose HFDs were categorized into six developmental stages. Motor-Free-Visual-Perception Test, Movement-ABC, Performance Intelligence Quotient (PIQ: Wechsler Scale), and the Visual-Motor Integration test were used. Fine motor functions were explored using ImageJ. Results: Age-expected HFDs were drawn by 87% of the children, while 13%, mostly preterm boys, drew immature ones. Stages of HFD were related to both PIQ and Movement-ABC. Visuomotor control and visual perception significantly explained the HFD. The sensitivity and specificity of HFD as a screening tool was moderate to good. Conclusions: HFD is influenced by visual perception and visuomotor control and can be used for screening developmental delay at preschool age.", "Although previous reports produced converging empirical evidence of a core deficit on visuospatial processing in children with a nonverbal learning disability (NLD), few studies compared the visuospatial profile of individuals with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) or NLD in visuoconstructive and visuospatial working memory tasks. Nor did any of these studies investigate the role of the local bias, typically observed in ASD, when comparing these clinical groups. The present study aimed to analyze whether NLD and ASD share any characteristics.\nA group of participants with NLD (n = 17) was compared with another group who had ASD (n = 17) without intellectual disability (ID), and without a peak in visuospatial intelligence, and with a control group (n = 17). Participants aged from 8 to 18 years performed a visuoconstructive and a visuospatial working memory task in which global-local processing styles were manipulated.\nThe analysis of their visuospatial processing clearly distinguished between the neuropsychological profiles of the group with ASD without ID and the group with NLD: the latter performed less well than the former in all domains. The participants with ASD without ID had a more heterogeneous visuospatial profile, showing a diminished sensitivity to perceptual cohesiveness only in the visuoconstructive task.\nExamining different visuospatial domains and manipulating the cohesiveness of the stimuli might be useful for better discriminating between NLD and ASD without ID.

Screen media activity (SMA; e.g., watching television or videos, playing video games, or using social media) is a common recreational activity in children and adolescents; however, its effect on brain structure is not well understood. A multivariate approach with the first cross-sectional data release from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study was used to test the maturational coupling hypothesis, i.e. the notion that coordinated patterns of structural change related to specific behaviors. Moreover, the utility of this approach was tested by determining the association between these structural correlation networks and psychopathology or cognition. ABCD participants with usable structural imaging and SMA data (N\u202f=\u202f4277 of 4524) were subjected to a Group Factor Analysis (GFA) to identify latent variables that relate SMA to cortical thickness, sulcal depth, and gray matter volume. Subject scores from these latent variables were used in generalized linear mixed-effect models to investigate associations between SMA and internalizing and externalizing psychopathology, as well as fluid and crystalized intelligence. Four SMA-related GFAs explained 37% of the variance between SMA and structural brain indices. SMA-related GFAs correlated with brain areas that support homologous functions. Some but not all SMA-related factors corresponded with higher externalizing (Cohen's d effect size (ES) 0.06-0.1) but not internalizing psychopathology and lower crystalized (ES: 0.08-0.1) and fluid intelligence (ES: 0.04-0.09). Taken together, these findings support the notion of SMA related maturational coupling or structural correlation networks in the brain and provides evidence that individual differences of these networks have mixed consequences for psychopathology and cognitive performance.", "The application of artificial intelligence is developing rapidly in various fields with the improvement of computing power, big data processing, and diversity of algorithms. It has a great potential value in the field of medical and healthcare, especially in the field of cancer diagnosis and treatment. In addition, it can analyze a large amount of data, information, and knowledge instantaneously. Therefore, it serves as a powerful tool for doctors to make the best treatment decisions.

Computer- aided compounds search, known as Virtual Screening, has shown the benefits to this field as a complement or even alternative to the robotic drug discovery. There are different methods and approaches to address this problem and most of them are often included in one of the main screening strategies. Machine learning, however, has established itself as a virtual screening methodology in its own right and it may grow in popularity with the new trends on artificial intelligence.\nThis paper will attempt to provide a comprehensive and structured review that collects the most important proposals made so far in this area of research. Particular attention is given to some recent developments carried out in the machine learning field: the deep learning approach, which is pointed out as a future key player in the virtual screening landscape.", "It is known that Cannabis in Brazil could either originate from Paraguay or be cultivated in Brazil. While consumer markets in the North and Northeast regions are maintained by national production, the rest of the country is supplied with Cannabis from Paraguay. However, the Brazilian Federal Police (BFP) has exponentially increased the seizure number of Cannabis seeds sent by mail. For this reason, the aim of the study was to assess the 13-loci short tandem repeat (STR) multiplex system proposed by Houston et al. (2015) to evaluate the power of such markers in individualization and origin differentiation of Cannabis sativa samples seized in Brazil by the BFP. To do so, 72 Cannabis samples seized in Brazil by BFP were analyzed. The principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) and probability identity (PI) analysis were computed. Additionally, the Cannabis samples' genotypes were subjected to comparison by Kruskal-Wallis H, followed by a multiple discriminant analysis (MDA). All samples analyzed revealed a distinct genetic profile. PCoA clearly discriminated the seizure sets based on their geographic origin. A combination of seven loci was enough to differentiate samples' genotypes, and the PI for a random sample is approximately one in 50 billion. The Cannabis samples were 100% correct as classified by Kruskal-Wallis H, followed by an MDA. The results of this study demonstrate that the 13-loci STR multiplex system successfully achieved the aim of sample individualization and origin differentiation and suggest that it could be a useful tool to help BFP intelligence in tracing back-trade routes.", "Given the foreseeable pervasiveness of artificial intelligence (AI) in modern societies, it is legitimate and necessary to ask the question how this new technology must be shaped to support the maintenance and strengthening of constitutional democracy. This paper first describes the four core elements of today's digital power concentration, which need to be seen in cumulation and which, seen together, are both a threat to democracy and to functioning markets. It then recalls the experience with the lawless Internet and the relationship between technology and the law as it has developed in the Internet economy and the experience with GDPR before it moves on to the key question for AI in democracy, namely which of the challenges of AI can be safely and with good conscience left to ethics, and which challenges of AI need to be addressed by rules which are enforceable and encompass the legitimacy of democratic process, thus laws. The paper closes with a call for a new culture of incorporating the principles of democracy, rule of law and human rights by design in AI and a three-level technological impact assessment for new technologies like AI as a practical way forward for this purpose.This article is part of a theme issue 'Governing artificial intelligence: ethical, legal, and technical opportunities and challenges'.", "The deployment of various forms of AI, most notably of machine learning algorithms, radically transforms many domains of social life. In this paper we focus on the news industry, where different algorithms are used to customize news offerings to increasingly specific audience preferences. While this personalization of news enables media organizations to be more receptive to their audience, it can be questioned whether current deployments of algorithmic news recommenders (ANR) live up to their emancipatory promise. Like in various other domains, people have little knowledge of what personal data is used and how such algorithmic curation comes about, let alone that they have any concrete ways to influence these data-driven processes. Instead of going down the intricate avenue of trying to make ANR more transparent, we explore in this article ways to give people more influence over the information news recommendation algorithms provide by thinking about and enabling possibilities to express voice After differentiating four ideal typical modalities of expressing voice (alternation, awareness, adjustment and obfuscation) which are illustrated with currently existing empirical examples, we present and argue for algorithmic recommender personae as a way for people to take more control over the algorithms that curate people's news provision.This article is part of a theme issue 'Governing artificial intelligence: ethical, legal, and technical opportunities and challenges'.", "Quantitative image analysis has deep roots in the usage of positron emission tomography (PET) in clinical and research settings to address a wide variety of diseases. It has been extensively employed to assess molecular and physiological biomarkers in vivo in healthy and disease states, in oncology, cardiology, neurology, and psychiatry. Quantitative PET allows relating the time-varying activity concentration in tissues/organs of interest and the basic functional parameters governing the biological processes being studied. Yet, quantitative PET is challenged by a number of degrading physical factors related to the physics of PET imaging, the limitations of the instrumentation used, and the physiological status of the patient. Moreover, there is no consensus on the most reliable and robust image-derived PET metric(s) that can be used with confidence in clinical oncology owing to the discrepancies between the conclusions reported in the literature. There is also increasing interest in the use of artificial intelligence based techniques, particularly machine learning and deep learning techniques in a variety of applications to extract quantitative features (radiomics) from PET including image segmentation and outcome prediction in clinical oncology. These novel techniques are revolutionizing clinical practice and are now offering unique capabilities to the clinical molecular imaging community and biomedical researchers at large. In this report, we summarize recent developments and future tendencies in quantitative PET imaging and present example applications in clinical decision support to illustrate its potential in the context of clinical oncology.", "This study investigated anxiety, one aspect of mental wellbeing, in fourth year veterinary students before the final clinical section of their course (intramural rotations (IMR)). It explored the relationship between reported anxiety and 'mindset': an individual's view on the ability to develop (eg, improve intelligence). Questionnaires were completed by 130 students. Students were mindset typed for ability and personality and rated their anxiety towards IMR. Students with different overall mindsets ('strong growth', 'growth' and 'fixed') were invited to participate in focus groups, to discuss causes of their anxieties. Quantitative results indicated 63.1 per cent of students had strong growth or growth mindsets overall, and that females were more fixed mindset-oriented than males. Females reported significantly greater anxiety than males. A fixed mindset view overall, and of ability, were significantly correlated with increased anxiety, while mindset view of personality was not. Students provided various reasons for their anxieties, which differed with mindset. Fixed mindset students (n=2) focused on concerns about knowledge, whereas growth students (n=6) were also anxious about work-life balance and future work. Growth students saw clinicians as future colleagues, rather than intimidating teachers. Students reported an awareness of being graded, although growth students were aware that IMR are learning opportunities.", "Contrary to the criticism that mysterious, unaccountable black-box software systems threaten to make the logic of critical decisions inscrutable, we argue that algorithms are fundamentally understandable pieces of technology. Software systems are designed to interact with the world in a controlled way and built or operated for a specific purpose, subject to choices and assumptions. Traditional power structures can and do turn systems into opaque black boxes, but technologies can always be understood at a higher level, intensionally in terms of their designs and operational goals and extensionally in terms of their inputs, outputs and outcomes. The mechanisms of a system's operation can always be examined and explained, but a focus on machinery obscures the key issue of power dynamics. While structural inscrutability frustrates users and oversight entities, system creators and operators always determine that the technologies they deploy are fit for certain uses, making no system wholly inscrutable. We investigate the contours of inscrutability and opacity, the way they arise from power dynamics surrounding software systems, and the value of proposed remedies from disparate disciplines, especially computer ethics and privacy by design. We conclude that policy should not accede to the idea that some systems are of necessity inscrutable. Effective governance of algorithms comes from demanding rigorous science and engineering in system design, operation and evaluation to make systems verifiably trustworthy. Rather than seeking explanations for each behaviour of a computer system, policies should formalize and make known the assumptions, choices, and adequacy determinations associated with a system.This article is part of the theme issue 'Governing artificial intelligence: ethical, legal, and technical opportunities and challenges'.", "Differences in myelination in the cortical mantle are important neurobiological mediators of variability in cognitive, emotional, and behavioral functioning. Past studies have found that personality traits reflecting such variability are linked to neuroanatomical and functional changes in prefrontal and temporo-parietal cortices. Whether these effects are partially mediated by the differences in intra-cortical myelin remains to be established.\nTo test this hypothesis, we employed vertex-wise intra-cortical myelin maps in n\u00a0=\u00a01,003 people from the Human Connectome Project. Multivariate regression analyses were used to test for the relationship between intra-cortical myelin and each of the five-factor model's personality traits, while accounting for age, sex, intelligence quotient, total intracranial volume, and the remaining personality traits.\nNeuroticism negatively related to frontal-pole myelin and positively to occipital cortex myelin. Extraversion positively related to superior parietal myelin. Openness negatively related to anterior cingulate myelin, while Agreeableness positively related to orbitofrontal myelin. Conscientiousness positively related to frontal-pole myelin and negatively to myelin content in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex.\nIntra-cortical myelin levels in brain regions with prolonged myelination are positively associated with personality traits linked to favorable outcome measures. These findings improve our understanding of the neurobiological underpinnings of variability in common behavioral dispositions.", "The literature on co-morbid psychiatric illnesses in adults with high-functioning autism (HFA) spectrum disorder is sparse.\nTo examine the nature of psychiatric comorbidity and treatment response in adults with HFA spectrum disorder.\nCase records of subjects (age \u226517 years) who presented over a period of 16 years with primary psychiatric symptoms and further detected to have an HFA spectrum disorder, were analyzed. Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) along with near normal to normal verbal communication and general intelligence were considered as HFA spectrum disorders.\n33 subjects met the study criteria. Nine subjects (27%) were diagnosed to have an underlying Asperger's syndrome and the rest 24 (73%) had pervasive developmental disorders unspecified (PDD NOS). None of the subjects were diagnosed to be suffering from ASD prior to the visit to our hospital. Mean age at the time of psychiatric consultation was 22.7 (s.d=4.8) years and mean age at the onset of psychiatric comorbidity was 16.48 (s.d=4.4) years. Nearly half of the sample had more than one type of psychiatric illness. Most common lifetime psychiatric diagnosis was obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) (n=16, 48.4%). Bipolar disorder (BD) was the second most common type of psychiatric manifestation (n=13, 39.3%) followed by psychotic spectrum disorders (n=9, 27.2%). Overall response to treatment was minimal.\nIndividuals with HFA spectrum disorders suffer from multiple psychiatric comorbidities. OCD is the most common type of psychiatric comorbidity followed by BD and psychotic spectrum disorders. Comorbid psychiatric illnesses in individuals with HFA show poor response to treatment.", "Children with learning disabilities are a heterogeneous group of children with a common characteristic discrepancy on the progress and development of their individual learning abilities. A few statistical analyses have been published regarding the factor analysis of the Greek Edition of Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-III. The aim of the research is the emergence of a new factorial model which describes the General Intelligence (g) of children and adolescents with learning disabilities, and that differs from the already existing intelligence models. This study aims to compare three-factor structure models of WISC-III in children with learning disabilities in the Greek population.\nA sample of 50 children were selected on the basis of research criteria from a total of 122 children who evaluated in a child psychiatric service in a general hospital, in a residential area in Greece. The Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Third Edition was used to assess children's cognitive function. Using multi-factor analysis, three alternative factor models were compared.\nAnalysis of factor structure models suggests a new bi-factorial model that more appropriately describes the areas of cognitive development of children with learning disabilities. The first factor includes Comprehension, Picture Arrangement, Coding, Block Design, and Object Assembly, whereas the second one combines Information, Similarities, Arithmetic, Vocabulary, and Picture Arrangement.\nThe present study shows the existence of a factorial model with two factors: one aggregating the Comprehension verbal subtest with four performance subtests and the other the Picture Arrangement performance subtest with four verbal subtests. This two-factor model includes the loadings in two factors that relate to sequencing abilities and verbal reasoning abilities of children. These findings assert the clinical utility of the intelligence evaluation in the specific population.", "The article discusses the governance of the digital as the new challenge posed by technological innovation. It then introduces a new distinction between soft ethics, which applies after legal compliance with legislation, such as the General Data Protection Regulation in the European Union, and hard ethics, which precedes and contributes to shape legislation. It concludes by developing an analysis of the role of digital ethics with respect to digital regulation and digital governance.This article is part of the theme issue 'Governing artificial intelligence: ethical, legal, and technical opportunities and challenges'.", "Machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) are rapidly becoming the most talked about and controversial topics in radiology and medicine. Over the past few years, the numbers of ML- or AI-focused studies in the literature have increased almost exponentially, and ML has become a hot topic at academic and industry conferences. However, despite the increased awareness of ML as a tool, many medical professionals have a poor understanding of how ML works and how to critically appraise studies and tools that are presented to us. Thus, we present a brief overview of ML, explain the metrics used in ML and how to interpret them, and explain some of the technical jargon associated with the field so that readers with a medical background and basic knowledge of statistics can feel more comfortable when examining ML applications.\nAttention to sample size, overfitting, underfitting, cross validation, as well as a broad knowledge of the metrics of machine learning, can help those with little or no technical knowledge begin to assess machine learning studies. However, transparency in methods and sharing of algorithms is vital to allow clinicians to assess these tools themselves.", "A central question in the field of foreign language acquisition is whether the processes involved in reading development in a foreign language are universal or dependent on characteristics of the specific language involved. We investigated the impact of orthographic depth and writing system on word reading acquisition in a foreign orthography, by studying children who are proficient readers in the transparent alphabetic Dutch orthography and who learn to read simultaneously in the transparent alphabetic Spanish orthography, the nontransparent alphabetic French orthography and the nonalphabetic Chinese orthography. Results showed that the skills that underlie foreign language word reading are not universal, but are different for alphabetic and nonalphabetic orthographies, and are also different for transparent and nontransparent alphabetic orthographies, albeit to a lesser extent. Word reading acquisition in transparent alphabetic Spanish depended mainly on reading skills in the native language. In contrast, in nontransparent alphabetic French and nonalphabetic Chinese, word reading was mainly influenced by cognitive skills: French word reading by phonological awareness and verbal intelligence, and Chinese word reading by verbal and nonverbal intelligence. Findings thus suggest that the processes underlying foreign language word reading acquisition are not universal but rather depend on the specific language involved.

Here, we investigated the cognitive mechanisms that permit successful continual learning in humans and harnessed our behavioral findings for neural network design. Humans categorized naturalistic images of trees according to one of two orthogonal task rules that were learned by trial and error. Training regimes that focused on individual rules for prolonged periods (blocked training) improved human performance on a later test involving randomly interleaved rules, compared with control regimes that trained in an interleaved fashion. Analysis of human error patterns suggested that blocked training encouraged humans to form \"factorized\" representation that optimally segregated the tasks, especially for those individuals with a strong prior bias to represent the stimulus space in a well-structured way. By contrast, standard supervised deep neural networks trained on the same tasks suffered catastrophic forgetting under blocked training, due to representational interference in the deeper layers. However, augmenting deep networks with an unsupervised generative model that allowed it to first learn a good embedding of the stimulus space (similar to that observed in humans) reduced catastrophic forgetting under blocked training. Building artificial agents that first learn a model of the world may be one promising route to solving continual task performance in artificial intelligence research.", "Effective treatment of maternal antenatal depression may ameliorate adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes in offspring. We performed two follow-up rounds of children at age 2 and age 5 whose mothers had received either specialized cognitive-behavioural therapy or routine care for depression while pregnant. Of the original cohort of 54 women, renewed consent was given by 28 women for 2-year follow-up and by 24 women for 5-year follow-up. Child assessments at the 2-year follow-up included the Parenting Stress Index (PSI), Bayley Scales of Infant Development (BSID-III) and the Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL). The 5-year follow-up included the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scales of Intelligence (WPPSI-III) and again the CBCL. Treatment during pregnancy showed significant benefits for children's development at age 2, but not at age 5. At 2 years, intervention effects were found with lower scores on the PSI Total score, Parent Domain and Child domain (d=1.44, 1.47, 0.96 respectively). A non-significant trend favoured the intervention group on most subscales of the CBCL and the BSID-III (most notably motor development: d =0.52). In contrast, at 5-year follow-up, no intervention effects were found. Also, irrespective of treatment allocation, higher depression or anxiety during pregnancy was associated with higher CBCL and lower WPPSI-III scores at 5 years. This is one of the first controlled studies to evaluate the long-term effect of antenatal depression treatment on infant neurodevelopmental outcomes, showing some benefit. Nevertheless, caution should be taken interpreting the results because of a small sample size, and larger studies are warranted.", "We aimed to investigate the involvement of premorbid intelligence quotient in higher prevalence of smoking in patients with schizophrenia.\nParticipants included 190 patients with schizophrenia (mean\u202f\u00b1\u202fstandard deviation age: 37.7\u202f\u00b1\u202f10.8\u202fyears; 88 males and 102 females) and 312 healthy individuals (mean\u202f\u00b1\u202fstandard deviation age: 38.1\u202f\u00b1\u202f13.8; 166 males and 146 females), matched for age, sex, and ethnicity (Japanese). Premorbid intelligence quotient was estimated using the Japanese Adult Reading Test and distress symptoms were assessed using the Hopkins Symptom Check List. Current smoking information was collected according to self-declarations.\nAs expected, the smoking rate was higher, while mean education level and Japanese Adult Reading Test scores were significantly lower, in patients with schizophrenia than in healthy individuals (p\u202f<\u202f0.01). The mean education level and Japanese Adult Reading Test scores were significantly lower in the smoker group than in the non-smoker group in both patients and healthy individuals (p\u202f<\u202f0.05). In the patient group alone, Hopkins Symptom Check List subscale and total scores were significantly higher in the smoker group than in the non-smoker group (p\u202f<\u202f0.05). A multivariate regression analysis showed that the Japanese Adult Reading Test score was a significant and negative predictor for smoking (p\u202f<\u202f0.001, odds ratio\u202f=\u202f0.97; 95% confidence interval: 0.96-0.99).\nOur results suggest that lower estimated premorbid intelligence quotient is an important variable in elucidating smoking behavior in humans and may be associated with higher prevalence of smoking in patients with schizophrenia.", "US physicians are experiencing burnout in alarming numbers. However, doctors with high levels of emotional intelligence (EI) may be immune to burnout, as they possess coping strategies which make them more resilient and better at managing stress. Educating physicians in EI may help prevent burnout and optimize their overall wellness. The purpose of our study was to determine if educational intervention increases the overall EI level of residents; specifically, their stress management and wellness scores.\nResidents from pediatrics and med-ped residency programs at a university-based training program volunteered to complete an online self-report EI survey (EQ-i 2.0) before and after an educational intervention. The four-hour educational workshop focused on developing four EI skills: self-awareness; self-management; social awareness; and social skills. We compared de-identified median score reports for the residents as a cohort before and after the intervention.\nThirty-one residents (20 pediatric and 11 med-ped residents) completed the EI survey at both time intervals and were included in the analysis of results. We saw a significant increase in total EI median scores before and after educational intervention (110 vs 114, P=0.004). The stress management composite median score significantly increased (105 vs 111, P<0.001). The resident's overall wellness score also improved significantly (104 vs 111, P=0.003).\nAs a group, our pediatric and med-peds residents had a significant increase in total EI and several other components of EI following an educational intervention. Teaching EI skills related to the areas of self-awareness, self-management, social awareness, and social skill may improve stress management skills, promote wellness, and prevent burnout in resident physicians.", "Stretchable and flexible photoelectric materials are highly desirable for the development of artificial intelligence products. However, it remains a challenge to fabricate a stable, processable, and cost-efficient material with both high photoelectric sensitivity and remarkable deformability. Herein, a new kind of photoelectric sensitive, highly stretchable and environmentally adaptive materials was developed through in situ synthesis and \u03c0-\u03c0 conjugation design. Specifically, a photoelectric elastomer zinc porphyrin SEBS(Zn-PorSEBS) was synthesized by introducing porphyrin to SEBS chain via a one-pot method. Then, graphene/zinc porphyrin SEBS (G/Zn-PorSEBS) composites were obtained by combing the elastomer with graphene sheets through solution blending. Notably, the resultant flexible composites were capable of capturing light changes with illumination on or off, and the maximum photocurrent density reached 0.13 \u03bcA cm-2. Moreover, the photoelectric composites exhibited a dramatic elongation (more than 1000%) and an excellent tensile strength about 20 MPa. This proposed strategy represents a general approach to manufacture photoelectric and flexible materials.", "Omega-3 fatty acids are well-known unsaturated fatty acids that are essential for growth and development in animals. They primarily participate in the development of intelligence, the nervous system, and vision, and the metabolism of neurotransmitters. Omega-3 fatty acids have been widely studied in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Omega-3 fatty acids are known to have neuroprotective effects due to their antioxidant capacity. Rotenone has been shown to induce neurotoxicity in vitro.\nWe investigated the protective effects of omega-3 fatty acids against AD in rat brain microvascular endothelial cells (RBMVECs) in vitro. Lipid peroxidation, reactive oxygen species (ROS), glutathione peroxidase (Gpx), reduced glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase levels were evaluated in RBMVECs. Flow cytometry was performed to assess apoptosis.\nLipid peroxidation and ROS were reduced in RBMVECs following incubation with omega-3 fatty acids. Catalase, Gpx, and SOD were increased in RBMVECs following incubation with omega-3 fatty acids. Flow cytometry showed that incubation with omega-3 fatty acids reduced the amount of apoptotic RBMVECs.\nOur results suggest that omega-3 fatty acids show potential as a therapeutic agent against AD.", "Adherence to treatment for chronic diseases is lower in children than in adults, less extensively studied in children and is associated with multiple related factors. The aim of this study is to perform a descriptive analysis of psycho-cognitive aspects of primary caregivers of pediatric patients with chronic rheumatic diseases, as well as socioeconomic and clinical factors, family functioning and treatment satisfaction.\nPrimary caregivers of 90 patients were included. Pairs (caregiver plus patient) were grouped as presenting good adherence (n\u2009=\u200950) or poor adherence (n\u2009=\u200940) according to the Morisky Adherence Test. Psycho-cognitive aspects were evaluated by Adult Self-Report and Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale tests. For statistical comparisons, quantitative variables with normal distribution were analyzed by Student's t test, and those with non-Gaussian distribution with the Mann Whitney test. Categorical variables were analyzed by Chi square test. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to estimate the contribution of the independent variables to adherence.\nCompared to caregivers in the good adherence group, caregivers in the poor adherence group were more likely to be classified as clinical on the scales for attention problems and externalizing problems, which include impulsiveness and aggressiveness. They also scored higher on the depressive problem scale. In addition, the average number of children per caregiver and the mean age of caregivers and patients were significantly higher in the poor adherence group, while the proportion of caregivers with higher education was lower. The poor adherence group also included a higher incidence of pediatric patients assuming sole responsibility for managing medications. Economic status, clinical factors, treatment satisfaction, family functioning and caregiver cognitive profile were not related to adherence, except for working memory index.\nOlder patients, patients as the one solely responsible for medication management, and caregivers with externalizing problems, were observed to be the most strongly associated to poor adherence. Interventions aimed at adolescent patients are needed. Also, psychological programs and interventional studies to better determine caregivers' behavioral/emotional status, and parent-child relationships are recommended.", "Advances in genomic technologies such as CRISPR-Cas9, mitochondrial replacement techniques, and in vitro gametogenesis may soon give us more precise and efficient tools to have children with certain traits such as beauty, intelligence, and athleticism. In this paper, I propose a new approach to the ethics of reproductive genetic engineering, a human rights approach. This approach relies on two claims that have certain, independent plausibility: (a) human beings have equal moral status, and (b) human beings have human rights to the fundamental conditions for pursuing a good life. I first argue that the human rights approach gives us a lower bound of when reproductive genetic engineering would be permissible. I then compare this approach with other approaches such as the libertarian, perfectionist, and life worth living approaches. Against these approaches, I argue that the human rights approach offers a novel, and more plausible, way of assessing the ethics of reproductive genetic engineering.", "Using machine learning, targets were identified for \u03b2-lapachone. Resorting to biochemical assays, \u03b2-lapachone was validated as a potent, ligand efficient, allosteric and reversible modulator of 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO). Moreover, we provide a rationale for 5-LO modulation and show that inhibition of 5-LO is relevant for the anticancer activity of \u03b2-lapachone. This work demonstrates the power of machine intelligence to deconvolute complex phenotypes, as an alternative and/or complement to chemoproteomics and as a viable general approach for systems pharmacology studies.", "A number of current trends will affect and probably change laboratory medicine, as we know it. Scientific and technological developments, digital health with big data and artificial intelligence, and centralization will change the interfaces among the specialties of laboratory medicine. They might even challenge the identity of some specialties. Other trends such as demographic changes, increased complexity of health care, digital health with electronic health records, and more demanding and well-informed patients will change the way laboratory medicine specialties deliver their services. This paper discusses the possible changes of laboratory medicine in Denmark - a Scandinavian country where almost all hospitals are public. If Danish laboratories grasp the new possibilities instead of trying to avoid them, laboratory medicine is likely to prosper. Such a positive development will call upon good leadership and a genuine willingness among laboratory specialist to adapt to a future where their own specialty might be very different from today.", "Surgical practice in gastro-enterology is concerned by deep technological advances. In the past century, the technological advances were conducted by clinical challenges and strategies. The 21th century is clearly led by the inversion of the paradigms. Medical practice does not only depend on the access to the technologies, but it seems submitted to her. Should the physician follow the engineer ? Does the clinical data collection, depend on the computer ? Who decides ? The doctor, the patient or the Artificial Intelligence ? Materiel et Methods : The present essay that definitely does not answer all these questions, is achieved thanks the practical experience of our colleagues. We also collected the recent literature devoted to new and promising technologies. The PUBMED review is completed by several think tanks reports coming from the industry.\nAmong the multiple aspects of present and future progresses, 6 among them could be pointed out: the benefit of augmented reality, mini and micro invasive techniques, robotic, news energies, big data and artificial intelligence.\nProgresses in data collection and treatment, imminent advances in micro mechanics, will completely change our clinical practice.

In this paper, the literature pertaining to acoustic signal processing for bowel sound analysis is reviewed and discussed. The paper outlines some of the fundamental approaches and machine learning principles that may be used in bowel sound analysis. The advances in signal processing techniques that have allowed useful information to be obtained from bowel sounds from a historical perspective are provided. The document specifically address the progress in bowel sound analysis, such as improved noise reduction, segmentation, signal enhancement, feature extraction, localization of sounds, and machine learning techniques. We have found that advanced acoustic signal processing incorporating novel machine learning methods and artificial intelligence can lead to better interpretation of acoustic information emanating from the bowel.", "To characterize the genotype and phenotype of Chinese patients with congenital hyperinsulinism (CHI) caused by activating mutations in GLUD1, the gene that encodes mitochondrial enzyme glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH).\nThe clinical data of glutamate dehydrogenase hyperinsulinism (GDH-HI) patients were reviewed, and gene mutations were confirmed by whole exome sequencing (WES) and Sanger DNA sequencing.\nTwenty-six patients with GDH-HI heterozygous missense mutations were identified from 240 patients diagnosed as congenital hyperinsulinism over past 15 years. The median age at onset was 8 months (range: 1 day of life to 3 years). Seizure disorder was common in our cohort of patients (23/26). Four patients had normal serum ammonia levels; the median serum concentration was 101\u2009\u03bcmol/L (range: 37-190\u2009\u03bcmol/L). Hypoglycemic symptoms could be triggered by fasting or protein meals in all patients while blood glucose could be well controlled in all patients with diazoxide. Dosage of diazoxide could be reduced by protein restriction. Attempts to lower ammonia levels failed with different therapies such as protein restriction, benzoate, or N-carbamoyl glutamate. In follow-up, 15 of 26 patients had normal intelligence. Eleven patients developed epilepsy at the age of 6 months to 11 years. De novo mutations in GLUD1 were found in 24 cases, and dominant inheritance was observed in the other two; all were heterozygous. A total of 35% (9/26) patients carried c.1493C>T (p.S445L) mutation.\nPhenotypic heterogeneity of GDH-HI patients was observed within the Chinese cohort in the present study. The fact that most patients had a GLUD1 p. S445L mutation implies that this site could be a hotspot in Chinese patients. A high frequency of GDH-HI with normal ammonia has been reported in this study. Hence, GLUD1 mutational analysis may be an important method to differential diagnosis of GDH-HI from other diazoxide-responsive CHI in Chinese patients.", "Failure to recover from proactive semantic interference (frPSI) has been shown to be more sensitive than traditional cognitive measures in different populations with preclinical Alzheimer's disease. The authors sought to characterize the structural and amyloid in vivo correlates of frPSI in cognitively normal offspring of patients with late-onset Alzheimer's disease (O-LOAD), compared with individuals without a family history of neurodegenerative disorders (CS). The authors evaluated the LASSI-L, a test tapping frPSI and other types of semantic interference and delayed recall on the RAVLT, along with 3-T MRI volumetry and positron emission tomography Pittsburgh compound B, in 27 O-LOAD and 18 CS with equivalent age, sex, years of education, ethnicity, premorbid intelligence, and mood symptoms. Recovery from proactive semantic interference (frPSI) and RAVLT delayed recall were lower in O-LOAD cases. Structural correlates of both cognitive dimensions were different in CS and O-LOAD, involving brain regions concerned with autonomic, motor, and motivational control in the former, and regions traditionally implicated in Alzheimer's disease in the latter. Better recovery from retroactive semantic interference was associated with less amyloid load in the left temporal lobe in O-LOAD but not CS. In middle-aged cognitively normal individuals with one parent affected with LOAD, frPSI was impaired compared with persons without a family history of LOAD. The neuroimaging correlates of such cognitive measure in those with one parent with LOAD involve Alzheimer's-relevant brain regions even at a relatively young age.", "Objective: Children in the Child Welfare System (CWS) are at high risk for multiple adverse outcomes. Since involvement in CWS and having a chronic medical condition are both risk factors for poor academic achievement, a logical view is that the combination is additive, increasing the odds of poor performance. However, several factors may complicate such an association. This study explores negative and positive factors that could affect academic achievement in children in CWS with chronic medical conditions. Method: In a secondary data analysis of a nationally representative, longitudinal sample of children in CWS (N = 5,501), subjects were divided into three groups based on chronic medical condition: High Prevalence, Low Severity (HPLS; asthma, eczema, allergy, diabetes), Other (OTH; all other chronic conditions, including those with primary central nervous system involvement), and NONE (children with no chronic condition). Using weighted analyses, hierarchical logistic regression models addressed factors associated with academic achievement. Predictor variables included chronic condition group, sex, income level, case substantiation, home placement, and school engagement. Intelligence quotient was a covariate. Outcome variables were strong performances for reading and math, defined by standard score \u226585. Results: In TOTAL group, 80% had strong reading; more in HPLS (85%) vs. NONE (79%) and OTH (80%), adjusted F = 433, p < 0.001. In TOTAL group, 67% had strong math; more in NONE (68%) and HPLS (68%) vs. OTH (60%), adjusted F = 1,278, p < 0.001. Models predicting to strong reading and math achievement were significant, R 2 = 0.51, p < 0.001 and R 2 = 0.43, p < 0.001, respectively. HPLS had increased odds of strong reading achievement (aOR 1.3, 95% CI 1.3-1.4); both HPLS and OTH had lower odds of strong math achievement (aOR 0.87 and 0.76), p < 0.001, respectively. Male sex had lower odds of strong reading (aOR 0.44) and math achievement (aOR 0.62); positive school engagement had higher odds of strong reading (aOR 1.18) and math achievement (aOR 2.04), all p < 0.001. Conclusion: If true, our findings challenge the general belief that chronic illness can only be associated with negative outcomes and that cumulative adversities are simply additive in terms of risk. Increased contact with the medical system may provide an opportunity for improving reading achievement for children in CWS and promoting positive school engagement.", "Clinicians are increasingly recognizing impulse control disorders (ICDs) as a complication of dopaminergic treatment in Parkinson's disease (PD). Considering the pivotal role of dopamine in reward information processing, ICDs may originate from dysregulation of reward-oriented behavior, and the behavioral changes may be reflected in shifts of psychological risk preference during decision-making. We used a behavioral economics paradigm to evaluate quantitatively the risk preferences of PD patients in levodopa on and off states. We also examined age-matched healthy controls. We found that levodopa increased the subjective value and prolonged the decision time in PD patients. These effects are apparently not explained by kinematic improvements but are attributed to psychological shifts of risk preferences and increased attention during risky decision-making. The risk preferences of healthy controls were similar to those of PD on levodopa treatment. The risk preferences of PD patients were not correlated with the scores of routine cognitive batteries, suggesting that dopamine-sensitive risk preferences are independent of cognitive capacities as measured by conventional batteries, including general intelligence, memory, and frontal functioning. By contrast, apathy and ICD partially predicted the risk attitude in PD patients, suggesting a common background of limbic origin behind these properties. The present results demonstrated that dopamine deficiency in off-state PD leads to risk-avoiding behavior and levodopa treatment increases the risk preferences. Behavioral economics framework is useful to evaluate short-term psychological changes in response to levodopa in PD patients.", "Scientists, stakeholders and decision makers face trade-offs between adopting simple or complex approaches when modeling ecosystem services (ES). Complex approaches may be time- and data-intensive, making them more challenging to implement and difficult to scale, but can produce more accurate and locally specific results. In contrast, simple approaches allow for faster assessments but may sacrifice accuracy and credibility. The ARtificial Intelligence for Ecosystem Services (ARIES) modeling platform has endeavored to provide a spectrum of simple to complex ES models that are readily accessible to a broad range of users. In this paper, we describe a series of five \"Tier 1\" ES models that users can run anywhere in the world with no user input, while offering the option to easily customize models with context-specific data and parameters. This approach enables rapid ES quantification, as models are automatically adapted to the application context. We provide examples of customized ES assessments at three locations on different continents and demonstrate the use of ARIES' spatial multi-criteria analysis module, which enables spatial prioritization of ES for different beneficiary groups. The models described here use publicly available global- and continental-scale data as defaults. Advanced users can modify data input requirements, model parameters or entire model structures to capitalize on high-resolution data and context-specific model formulations. Data and methods contributed by the research community become part of a growing knowledge base, enabling faster and better ES assessment for users worldwide. By engaging with the ES modeling community to further develop and customize these models based on user needs, spatiotemporal contexts, and scale(s) of analysis, we aim to cover the full arc from simple to complex assessments, minimizing the additional cost to the user when increased complexity and accuracy are needed.", "This retrospective descriptive study was undertaken to further define the intelligence profiles of children with mitochondrial disorders, in the context of seizures and age of symptom onset.\nWe retrospectively identified forty-nine pediatric patients with definitive mitochondrial disease diagnoses and complete intelligence or adaptive functioning testing data. Patients were 0-216\u202fmonths at onset of symptoms and 61-250\u202fmonths of age at testing. Twenty-four of 49 patients had seizures. Twenty-one of the 24 patients with seizures had medically intractable seizures. All patients had Wechsler Intellectual Quotient (IQ) testing, except nine patients with seizures who were unable to engage in IQ testing and were assessed with a structured parent interview measure, the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales. We used descriptive and exploratory data analysis methods to characterize test results.\nDistribution of ages for patients with the Vineland assessment was younger than those given the Wechsler. The median overall score (combining Wechsler and Vineland summary scores) for all patients was 85 (interquartile range [IQR]: 50, 102), with the group without seizures obtaining a higher median Full Scale IQ (FSIQ) of 100 (IQR: 86, 109), compared to the group with seizures with a median FSIQ of 67 (IQR: 49.5, 89), a difference that is both statistically and clinically different (\u0394\u202f=\u202f33; 95% CI: 9, 52). The adaptive function measure was composed of patients only with intractable epilepsy and yielded the lowest overall median summary score of 43 (IQR: 37, 50). This general trend in differences between the FSIQ scores of the groups with and without seizures was also seen across all subscale measures analyzed-IQ index scores and two subtest scores, Digit Span and Coding-though differences were not always statistically different. Vargha-Delaney's A effect sizes ranged between 0.68 and 0.90, trends that mirrored those of distributional and median differences. Groups without versus with seizures differed most distinctly in Performance IQ (PIQ), with the group without seizures' median PIQ being 100 (IQR 94, 112) versus the group with seizures' median PIQ being 63 (IQR 54, 84), a difference of 37 points (95% CI).\nResults suggest that patients with mitochondrial diseases with seizures and early onset disease represent a worse cognitive phenotype, as compared with those with no seizures, who can have average intelligence. Results are discussed in the context of current literature.", "The aim of this study was to assess the predictive role of coping related variables (trait emotional intelligence and reinvestment, challenge and threat appraisals and cardiac vagal activity) on cardiac vagal activity and working memory under low pressure (LP) and high pressure (HP) conditions. Participants (n\u202f=\u202f49) completed trait questionnaires, the Decision Specific Reinvestment Scale, the Movement Specific Reinvestment Scale and Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire. They realized the automated span task, which tests working memory, under counterbalanced LP and HP conditions. Cardiac vagal activity measurements were taken at rest, task and post task for 5\u202fmin, along with self-reported ratings of stress. Upon completion of the task, self-report measures of motivation, stress appraisal, attention and perceived pressure were completed. Current findings suggest cardiac vagal activity at rest can predict cardiac vagal activity under pressure, decision reinvestment influences cardiac vagal activity in cognitive tasks under LP and working memory performance is predicted by task cardiac vagal activity in HP only. These results show the importance of combining both subjective and objective psychophysiological variables in performance prediction and strengthen the need for this approach to be adopted across samples.", "We present the first experimental realization of a quantum artificial life algorithm in a quantum computer. The quantum biomimetic protocol encodes tailored quantum behaviors belonging to living systems, namely, self-replication, mutation, interaction between individuals, and death, into the cloud quantum computer IBM ibmqx4. In this experiment, entanglement spreads throughout generations of individuals, where genuine quantum information features are inherited through genealogical networks. As a pioneering proof-of-principle, experimental data fits the ideal model with accuracy. Thereafter, these and other models of quantum artificial life, for which no classical device may predict its quantum supremacy evolution, can be further explored in novel generations of quantum computers. Quantum biomimetics, quantum machine learning, and quantum artificial intelligence will move forward hand in hand through more elaborate levels of quantum complexity.", "Swarm intelligence draws its inspiration from the collective behaviour of many individual agents interacting with both one another and their environment. This paper presents a possibility to apply a swarm-based algorithm, modelled after the behaviour of individuals operating within a group where individuals move around in the manner intended to avoid mutual collisions, to create the most challenging maze developed on a board with determined dimensions. When solving such a problem, two complexity measures are used. Firstly, the complexity of the path was assumed to be a quality criterion, depending on the number of bends and the length of the path between two set points that was subjected to maximisation. Secondly, we focus on the well-known concept of the maze complexity given as the total complexity of the path and all branches. Owing to the uniqueness of the problem, consisting in the maze modification, a methodology was developed to make it possible for the individuals belonging to their population to make various types of movements, e.g., approach the best individual, within the range of visibility, or relocate randomly. The test results presented here indicate a potential prospect of application of the swarm-based methods to generate more and more challenging two-dimensional mazes.", "Age has been shown to have an impact on both grey (GM) and white matter (WM) volume, with a steeper slope of age-related decline in schizophrenia compared to healthy controls. In schizophrenia, the relation between age and brain volume is further complicated by factors such as lower intelligence, antipsychotic medication, and cannabis use, all of which have been shown to have independent effects on brain volume. In a study of first-episode, antipsychotic-na\u00efve schizophrenia patients (N\u202f=\u202f54) and healthy controls (N\u202f=\u202f56), we examined the effects of age on whole brain measures of GM and WM volume, and whether these relationships were moderated by schizophrenia and intelligence (IQ). Secondarily, we examined lifetime cannabis use as a moderator of the relationship between age and brain volume. Schizophrenia patients had lower GM volumes than healthy controls but did not differ on WM volume. We found an age effect on GM indicating that increasing age was associated with lower GM volumes, which did not differ between groups. IQ did not have a direct effect on GM, but showed a trend-level interaction with age, suggesting a greater impact of age with lower IQ. There were no age effects on WM volume, but a direct effect of IQ, with higher IQ showing an association with larger WM volume. Lifetime cannabis use did not alter these findings significantly. This study points to effects of schizophrenia on GM early in the illness, before antipsychotic treatment is initiated, suggesting that WM changes may occur later in the disease process.", "Automation of pharmaceutical safety case processing represents a significant opportunity to affect the strongest cost driver for a company's overall pharmacovigilance budget. A pilot was undertaken to test the feasibility of using artificial intelligence and robotic process automation to automate processing of adverse event reports. The pilot paradigm was used to simultaneously test proposed solutions of three commercial vendors. The result confirmed the feasibility of using artificial intelligence-based technology to support extraction from adverse event source documents and evaluation of case validity. In addition, the pilot demonstrated viability of the use of safety database data fields as a surrogate for otherwise time-consuming and costly direct annotation of source documents. Finally, the evaluation and scoring method used in the pilot was able to differentiate vendor capabilities and identify the best candidate to move into the discovery phase.", "Patients with moyamoya vasculopathy (MMV) may experience cognitive impairment, but its reported frequency, severity, and nature vary. In a systematic review and metaanalysis, we aimed to assess the presence, severity, and nature of cognitive impairments in children and adults with MMV.\nWe followed the MOOSE guidelines for meta-analysis and systematic reviews of observational studies. We searched Ovid Medline and Embase for studies published between January 1, 1969 and October 4, 2016. Independent reviewers extracted data for mean intelligence quotient (IQ) and standardized z-scores for cognitive tests, and determined percentages of children and adults with cognitive deficits, before and after conservative or surgical treatment. We explored associations between summary measures of study characteristics and cognitive impairments by linear regression analysis.\nWe included 17 studies (11 studies reporting on 281 children, six on 153 adults). In children, the median percentage with impaired cognition was 30% (range, 13% to 67%); median IQ was 98 (range, 71 to 107). Median z-score was -0.39 for memory, and -0.43 for processing speed. In adults, the median percentage with impaired cognition was 31% (range, 0% to 69%); median IQ was 95 (range, 94 to 99). Median z-scores of cognitive domains were between -0.9 and -0.4, with multiple domains being affected. We could not identify determinants of cognitive impairment.\ns A large proportion of children and adults with MMV have cognitive impairment, with modest to large deficits across various cognitive domains. Further studies should investigate determinants of cognitive deficits and deterioration, and the influence of revascularization treatment on cognitive functioning.", "We sought to construct and evaluate a deep learning (DL) model to diagnose early glaucoma from spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) images.\nArtificial intelligence diagnostic tool development, evaluation, and comparison.\nThis multi-institution study included pretraining data of 4316 OCT images (RS3000) from 1371 eyes with open angle glaucoma (OAG) regardless of the stage of glaucoma and 193 normal eyes. Training data included OCT-1000/2000 images from 94 eyes of 94 patients with early OAG (mean deviation >\u00a0-5.0 dB) and 84 eyes of 84 normal subjects. Testing data included OCT-1000/2000 from 114 eyes of 114 patients with early OAG (mean deviation >\u00a0-5.0 dB) and 82 eyes of 82 normal subjects. A DL (convolutional neural network) classifier was trained using a pretraining dataset, followed by a second round of training using an independent training dataset. The DL model input features were the 8\u00a0\u00d7 8 grid macular retinal nerve fiber layer thickness and ganglion cell complex layer thickness from spectral-domain OCT. Diagnostic accuracy was investigated in the testing dataset. For comparison, diagnostic accuracy was also evaluated using the random forests and support vector machine models. The primary outcome measure was the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AROC).\nThe AROC with the DL model was 93.7%. The AROC significantly decreased to between 76.6% and 78.8% without the pretraining process. Significantly smaller AROCs were obtained with random forests and support vector machine models (82.0% and 67.4%, respectively).\nA DL model for glaucoma using spectral-domain OCT offers a substantive increase in diagnostic performance.", "Eye movement studies are subject of interest in human cognition. Cortical activity and cognitive load impress eye movement influentially. Here, we investigated whether fluid intelligence (FI) has any effect on eye movement pattern in a comparative visual search (CVS) task. FI of individuals was measured using the Cattell test, and participants were divided into three groups: low FI, middle FI, and high FI. Eye movements of individuals were then recorded during the CVS task. Eye movement patterns were extracted and compared statistically among the three groups. Our experiment demonstrated that eye movement patterns were significantly different among the three groups. Pearson correlation coefficients between FI and eye movement parameters were also calculated to assess which of the eye movement parameters were most affected by FI. Our findings illustrate that saccade peak velocity had the greatest positive correlation with FI score and the ratio of total fixation duration to total saccade duration had the greatest negative correlation with FI. Next, we extracted 24 features from eye movement patterns and designed: (1) a classifier to categorize individuals and (2) a regression analysis to predict the FI score of individuals. In the best case examined, the classifier categorized subjects with 68.3% accuracy, and the regression predicted FI of individuals with a 0.54 correlation between observed FI and predicted FI. In our investigation, the results have emphasized that imposed loads on low FI individuals is greater than that of high FI individuals in the cognitive load tasks.", "To describe and compare shift leaders' important information needs by profession, unit, time of day and type of hospital.\nProfessionals responsible for care provision in hospital units make ad hoc decisions about available resources to meet patient care needs but, currently, much effort is needed to obtain the necessary information to support decision making.\nThis survey was carried out in nine randomly chosen hospitals in Finland. Nurses and physicians responsible for day-to-day operations were eligible to participate (N\u00a0=\u00a0873). The response rate was 65% (n\u00a0=\u00a0570, including 453 nurses and 111 physicians). Data were collected in 2015-2016 using the Hospital Shift Leaders' Information Needs Questionnaire with 114 information need items.\nShift leaders reported many real-time information needs. Nurses' important information needs concerned patients, personnel, and materials, and physicians' needs focused on patient care. Large mean differences existed in the needs between nurses and physicians, and imaging units when compared to other units.\nReal-time information systems for shift leaders should consider the needs of different users to support shared situational awareness and operational intelligence.\nThe important information-need items identified here may be used in designing and developing information systems that better support shift leaders' work in hospitals.", "Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) is a rapidly developing computer technology that has begun to be widely used in the medical field to improve the professional level and efficiency of clinical work, in addition to avoiding medical errors. In developing countries, the inequality between urban and rural health services is a serious problem, of which the shortage of qualified healthcare providers is the major cause of the unavailability and low quality of healthcare in rural areas. Some studies have shown that the application of computer-assisted or AI medical techniques could improve healthcare outcomes in rural areas of developing countries. Therefore, the development of suitable medical AI technology for rural areas is worth discussing and probing. Methods: This article reviews and discusses the literature concerning the prospects of medical AI technology, the inequity of healthcare, and the application of computer-assisted or AI medical techniques in rural areas of developing countries. Results: Medical AI technology not only could improve physicians' efficiency and quality of medical services, but other health workers could also be trained to use this technique to compensate for the lack of physicians, thereby improving the availability of healthcare access and medical service quality. This article proposes a multilevel medical AI service network, including a frontline medical AI system (basic level), regional medical AI support centers (middle levels), and a national medical AI development center (top level). Conclusion: The promotion of medical AI technology in rural areas of developing countries might be one means of alleviating the inequality between urban and rural health services. The establishment of a multilevel medical AI service network system may be a solution.", "We investigated cross-lagged relations between leisure activity participation and Trail Making Test (TMT) performance over 6 years and whether those reciprocal associations differed between individuals.\nWe analyzed data from 232 participants tested on performance in TMT Parts A and B as well as interviewed on leisure activity participation in 2 waves 6 years apart. Mean age in the Wave 1 was 73.42 years. Participants were also tested on vocabulary (Mill Hill scale) as a proxy indicator of crystallized intelligence and reported information on early and midlife cognitive reserve markers (education and occupation). Latent cross-lagged models were applied to investigate potential reciprocal activity-TMT relationships.\nThe relation of leisure activity participation predicting TMT performance 6 years later was significantly larger than was the relation of TMT performance predicting later leisure activity participation. Statistically comparing different moderator groups revealed that this pattern was evident both in individuals with low education and in those with high education but, notably, emerged in only young-old adults (but not in old-old adults), in individuals with a low cognitive level of job in midlife (but not in those with a high cognitive level of job in midlife), and in individuals with high scores in vocabulary (but not in those with low scores in vocabulary).\nLate-life leisure activity participation may predict later cognitive status in terms of TMT performance, but individuals may markedly differ with respect to such effects. Implications for current cognitive reserve and neuropsychological aging research are discussed.

Change will be a continuous iteration between evaluation and revaluation. Medicine is a social science. It is about people, societies and human interaction and communication. Medical College of the future should be developed in the light of social constructivism theories. Students from year one, day one, should be embedded in the work environment. Academic Healthcare Systems will be the norm not the exceptional. The training of students will be in all healthcare related facilities in the community. Public-private partnership in education and research will spread and become more regulated and encouraged. The students who want to be the future physicians should be selected differently. The curriculum will be more context related. Entrustable professional activities will be measured more frequently at different points of the students learning trajectory. Research and innovation will be integral to the students' learning experience. They should be exposed to how researchers think and behave and be embedded in a research environment. The medical college of the future will be using advanced technology which will be disruptive and transform existing educational models. E-Learning materials will be shared by consortia of collaborating medical colleges from all around the world. Artificial intelligence and machine learning will influence how students learn. National and international accreditation systems should ensure quality, but not stifle innovation. Physical learning spaces should reflect and express the underlying assumptions about \"what is learning and teaching?\". This should be reflected and expressed through the design of its buildings, infrastructure, technology, furniture and out of class learning environment. Predicting the future is difficult in a rapidly changing world. Next generation physicians should be competent in treating the next generation of patients while maintaining the health of the population.", "To supplement memory-based Performance Validity Tests (PVTs) in identifying noncredible performance, we examined the validity of the two most commonly used nonmemory-based PVTs-Dot Counting Test (DCT) and Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Fourth edition (WAIS-IV) Reliable Digit Span (RDS)-as well as two alternative WAIS-IV Digit Span (DS) subtest PVTs. Examinees completed DCT, WAIS-IV DS, and the following criterion PVTs: Test of Memory Malingering, Word Memory Test, and Word Choice Test. Validity groups were determined by passing 3 (valid; n = 69) or failing \u2a7e2 (noncredible; n = 30) criterion PVTs. DCT, RDS, RDS-Revised (RDS-R), and WAIS-IV DS Age-Corrected Scaled Score (ACSS) were significantly correlated (but uncorrelated with memory-based PVTs). Combining RDS, RDS-R, and ACSS with DCT improved classification accuracy (particularly for DCT/ACSS) for detecting noncredible performance among valid-unimpaired, but largely not valid-impaired examinees. Combining DCT with ACSS may uniquely assess and best supplement memory-based PVTs to identify noncredible neuropsychological test performance in cognitively unimpaired examinees.", "Hospitalization of elderly patients can lead to serious adverse effects on their functional capability. Identifying the underlying factors leading to such adverse effects is an active area of medical research. The purpose of the current paper is to show the potential of artificial intelligence in the form of machine learning to complement the existing medical research. This is accomplished by studying the outcome of hospitalization of elderly patients as a supervised learning task. A rich set of features characterizing the medical and social situation of elderly patients is leveraged and using confusion matrices, association rule mining, and two different classes of supervised learning algorithms, it is shown that the need for help and supervision are the most important features predicting whether these patients will return home after hospitalization. Such findings can help to improve hospitalization and rehabilitation of elderly patients.", "Proportions of face components appear to play a role in facial attractiveness.\nThe aim of the study was to establish the best proportions of face components in relation to whole face shape for facial attractiveness.\nOnly one face component (eye, nose, or lips) of a model in a series of photographs was altered using a computer program. Alterations consisted of size reduction or augmentation by 5% or 10%. Each photograph depicted a particular face component altered to either 90%, 95%, 100%, 105%, or 110% of its original size. Collages of photographs were shown to 167 individuals (male and female) for a fixed period of 7\u00a0seconds. Their task was to indicate the most attractive photograph of a model in a presented collage.\nIn total, 48.1% of individuals preferred enhanced eyes both in males and females. We found that the preferred mean eye size in women was statistically significantly higher than that in men. In total, 64.8% of respondents preferred reduced nose proportions in women (27.5% found a reduction to 90% of the original size more attractive while 37.3% preferred a reduction to 95%). It was demonstrated that the preferred mean nose size was statistically significantly lower in females in comparison with males. Respondents expressed a greater preference for nose reduction in women in comparison with men. 38.4% of respondents (in regard to both male and female mouth) preferred reduced mouth. 40.7% of respondents preferred reduced mouth in the female model.\nOur work delivers statistically significant evidence that facial attractiveness increases together with the enlargement of the uncovered eye surface as well as the reduction in nose and lip size. Data were obtained using modern collective intelligence methods of validation. Written consent was obtained from all study participants.", "Owing to the rapid progress of the medical science and technology, the chances of survival of the extremely low birth weight (<1000 g) preterm babies have dramatically improved. Nevertheless, the research findings on their long-term developmental outcome are inconsistent.\nOur study has attempted to contribute to the understanding of the developmental mechanisms in the extremely low birth weight preterm infants and to the prediction of the developmental outcomes taking into account of the risk factors of development.\n34 preterm children who were free of any major central nervous system injury were followed up from one to 5-6 years of age. The psychomotor development of the infants was assessed at 1 and 2 years of age and, at 5-6 years of age, intelligence tests were administered to the children. Perinatal and environmental factors were included in the data analysis.\nThe extremely low birth weight preterm children as a group displayed no developmental delay at any of the measurement points. The mean developmental quotients were 98.6 and 106.6 at ages 1 and 2 years, respectively. At 5-6 years of age, the mean verbal IQ was 101.4, while the mean performance IQ was 92.9. Behind the group means there was a wide range of individual variations. The most powerful contributors to the developmental outcomes were birth weight, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, intra-uterine growth retardation, gender, and maternal education. The girls had a significant advantage over the boys in language development. Verbal intelligence was hampered by intracranial hemorrhage, while intrauterine growth restriction had a similar effect on the performance IQ.\nOur results suggest that even the extremely preterm infants may have rather good chances of satisfactory mental development. However, the individual developmental prospects are influenced by a great number of domain-specific risk- and protective factors. Although at a group-level, infant psychomotor development is a significant predictor of later intelligence quotient, the rate of development may change at any age. The phenomenon of \"moving risk\" underscores the importance of the long-term follow-up of preterm infants.

Knowledge on the long-term outcomes after treatment with OK-432 is limited.\nThe aim of this study was to assess the long-term outcomes of children treated in utero with OK-432.\nWe performed follow-up on pregnancies and children treated in utero with OK-432 between 2003 and 2009 at Copenhagen University Hospital Rigshospitalet for pleural effusions at gestational age (GA) 16+0-21+6 weeks. Anamnestic information, physical examination, pulmonary function test, neuropediatric examination, and intelligence testing using the Wechsler Intelligence Scale were used for evaluation.\nFourteen cases, all chylothorax, were treated with OK-432. None had preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM), and the median GA at delivery was 38+5 (24+4-41+5) weeks. Twelve children were eligible for follow-up. The median age at follow-up was 11.4 (7.8-13.8) years. Pulmonary function was normal in all children and the mean full-scale IQ did not differ from that of normal children. Four children had a diagnosed medical condition, attention deficit disorder, or genetic syndrome. The remaining children had normal follow-up.\nChildren treated with OK-432 have comparable survival rates and long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes to those treated with thoracoamniotic shunts. There seems to be a lower risk of procedure-related PPROM.", "Artificial Intelligence (AI) plays a pivotal role in drug discovery. In particular artificial neural networks such as deep neural networks or recurrent networks drive this area. Numerous applications in property or activity predictions like physicochemical and ADMET properties have recently appeared and underpin the strength of this technology in quantitative structure-property relationships (QSPR) or quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR). Artificial intelligence in de novo design drives the generation of meaningful new biologically active molecules towards desired properties. Several examples establish the strength of artificial intelligence in this field. Combination with synthesis planning and ease of synthesis is feasible and more and more automated drug discovery by computers is expected in the near future.", "Artificial intelligence and machine learning have the potential to revolutionize the delivery of health care. But designing machine learning-based decision support systems is not a merely technical challenge. It also requires attention to bioethical principles. As AI and machine learning advance, bioethical frameworks need to be tailored to address the problems that these evolving systems might pose, and the development of these automated systems also needs to be tailored to incorporate bioethical principles.", "Based on increasing evidence suggesting that MS pathology involves alterations in bioactive lipid metabolism, the present analysis was aimed at generating a complex serum lipid-biomarker. Using unsupervised machine-learning, implemented as emergent self-organizing maps of neuronal networks, swarm intelligence and Minimum Curvilinear Embedding, a cluster structure was found in the input data space comprising serum concentrations of d\u2009=\u200943 different lipid-markers of various classes. The structure coincided largely with the clinical diagnosis, indicating that the data provide a basis for the creation of a biomarker (classifier). This was subsequently assessed using supervised machine-learning, implemented as random forests and computed\u00a0ABC analysis-based feature selection. Bayesian statistics-based biomarker creation was used to map the diagnostic classes of either MS patients (n\u2009=\u2009102) or healthy subjects (n\u2009=\u2009301). Eight lipid-markers passed the feature selection and comprised GluCerC16, LPA20:4, HETE15S, LacCerC24:1, C16Sphinganine, biopterin and the endocannabinoids PEA and OEA. A complex classifier or biomarker was developed that predicted MS at a sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of approximately 95% in training and test data sets, respectively. The present successful application of serum lipid marker concentrations to MS data is encouraging for further efforts to establish an MS biomarker based on serum lipidomics.", "The use of quantitative analysis in single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET) has become an integral part of current clinical practice and plays a crucial role in the detection and risk stratification of coronary artery disease. Emerging technologies, new protocols, and new quantification methods have had a significant impact on the diagnostic performance and prognostic value of nuclear cardiology imaging, while reducing the need for clinician oversight. In this review, we aim to describe recent advances in automation and quantitative analysis in nuclear cardiology.\nRecent publications have shown that fully automatic processing is feasible, limiting human input to specific cases where aberrancies are detected by the quality control software. Furthermore, there is evidence indicating that fully quantitative analysis of myocardial perfusion imaging is feasible and can achieve at least similar diagnostic accuracy as visual interpretation by an expert clinician. In addition, the use of fully automated quantification in combination with machine learning algorithms can provide incremental diagnostic and prognostic value over the traditional method of expert visual interpretation.\nEmerging technologies in nuclear cardiology focus on automation and the use of artificial intelligence as part of the interpretation process. This review highlights the benefits and limitations of these applications, and outlines future directions in the field.", "This work presents a proof-of-concept study in artificial-intelligence-assisted (AI-assisted) chemistry where a machine-learning-based molecule generator is coupled with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, synthesis, and measurement. Although deep-learning-based molecule generators have shown promise, it is unclear to what extent they can be useful in real-world materials development. To assess the reliability of AI-assisted chemistry, we prepared a platform using a molecule generator and a DFT simulator, and attempted to generate novel photofunctional molecules whose lowest excited states lie at desired energetic levels. A 10 day run on the 12-core server discovered 86 potential photofunctional molecules around target lowest excitation levels, designated as 200, 300, 400, 500, and 600 nm. Among the molecules discovered, six were synthesized, and five were confirmed to reproduce DFT predictions in ultraviolet visible absorption measurements. This result shows the potential of AI-assisted chemistry to discover ready-to-synthesize novel molecules with modest computational resources.", "Type 2 diabetes is the most expensive chronic disease in the United States. Two-thirds of US adults have prediabetes or are overweight and at risk for type 2 diabetes. Intensive in-person behavioral counseling can help patients lose weight and make healthy behavior changes to improve their health outcomes. However, with the shortage of health care providers and associated costs, such programs do not adequately service all patients who could benefit. The health care system needs effective and cost-effective interventions that can lead to positive health outcomes as scale. This study investigated the ability of conversational artificial intelligence (AI), in the form of a standalone, fully automated text-based mobile coaching service, to promote weight loss and other health behaviors related to diabetes prevention. This study also measured user acceptability of AI coaches as alternatives to live health care professionals.\nThe objective of this study was to evaluate weight loss, changes in meal quality, and app acceptability among users of the Lark Weight Loss Health Coach AI (HCAI), with the overarching goal of increasing access to compassionate health care via mobile health. Lessons learned in this study can be applied when planning future clinical trials to evaluate HCAI and when designing AI to promote weight loss, healthy behavior change, and prevention and self-management of chronic diseases.\nThis was a longitudinal observational study among overweight and obese (body mass index \u226525) participants who used HCAI, which encourages weight loss and healthy diet choices through elements of cognitive behavioral therapy. Weight loss, meal quality, physical activity, and sleep data were collected through user input and, for sleep and physical activity, partly through automatic detection by the user's mobile phone. User engagement was assessed by duration and amount of app use. A 4-question in-app user trust survey assessed app usability and acceptability.\nData were analyzed for participants (N=70) who met engagement standards set forth by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria for Diabetes Prevention Program, a clinically proven weight loss program focused on preventing diabetes. Weight loss (standard error of the mean) was 2.38% (0.69%) of baseline weight. The average duration of app use was 15 (SD 1.0) weeks, and users averaged 103 sessions each. Predictors of weight loss included duration of AI use, number of counseling sessions, and number of meals logged. Percentage of healthy meals increased by 31%. The in-app user trust survey had a 100% response rate and positive results, with a satisfaction score of 87 out of 100 and net promoter score of 47.\nThis study showed that use of an AI health coach is associated with weight loss comparable to in-person lifestyle interventions. It can also encourage behavior changes and have high user acceptability. Research into AI and its application in telemedicine should be pursued, with clinical trials investigating effects on weight, health behaviors, and user engagement and acceptability.", "Mammals underwent a profound diversification after the end-Cretaceous mass extinction, with placentals rapidly expanding in body size and diversity to fill new niches vacated by dinosaurs. Little is known, however, about the brains and senses of these earliest placentals, and how neurosensory features may have promoted their survival and diversification. We here use computed tomography (CT) to describe the brain, inner ear, sinuses, and endocranial nerves and vessels of Carsioptychus coarctatus, a periptychid \"condylarth\" that was among the first placentals to blossom during the few million years after the extinction, in the Paleocene. Carsioptychus has a generally primitive brain and inner ear that is similar to the inferred ancestral eutherian/placental condition. Notable \"primitive\" features include the large, anteriorly expanded, and conjoined olfactory bulbs, proportionally small neocortex, lissencephalic cerebrum, and large hindbrain compared to the cerebrum. An encephalization quotient (EQ) cannot be confidently calculated because of specimen crushing but was likely very small, and comparisons with other extinct placentals reveal that many Paleocene \"archaic\" mammals had EQ values below the hallmark threshold of modern placentals but within the zone of nonmammalian cynodonts, indicative of small brains and low intelligence. Carsioptychus did, however, have a \"conventional\" hearing range for a placental, but was not particularly agile, with semicircular canal dimensions similar to modern pigs. This information fleshes out the biology of a keystone Paleocene \"archaic\" placental, but more comparative work is needed to test hypotheses of how neurosensory evolution was related to the placental radiation.

However, as EI is composed of self- and other-focused dimensions, it remains unclear which dimensions are responsible for better performance and well-being. We hypothesized that other-focused EI dimensions in particular relate to task performance, whereas self-focused EI dimensions relate to employees' subjective stress and physiological responses to emotional job demands. We asked Dutch secretaries (N = 110) to professionally respond to five emotionally demanding work-related phone calls. The secretaries' skin conductance levels were recorded during the calls, and the secretaries had to indicate their stress levels after each call. Two independent raters coded the secretaries' effectiveness and the number of emotion regulation attempts during the phone calls. The results showed that other-focused emotion regulation was positively related to only one of the task performance indicators during three phone calls. In line with the hypotheses, self-focused emotion appraisal was negatively related to the secretaries' subjective stress levels after all the phone calls. Self-focused emotion regulation was positively related to the secretaries' skin conductance levels during all but one of the phone calls. This outcome suggests that self-focused EI dimensions decrease the subjective experience of stress but are accompanied by physiological costs, whereas other-focused emotion regulation may be positively but weakly related to task performance in emotionally demanding contexts.

This ultimately has a major impact on all aspects of normal living. To attempt to understand this, Artificial Intelligence (AI) was used to identify potential biomarkers. These were alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone (\u03b1-MSH), vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and some inflammatory cytokines. We assessed the association of fatigue, quality of sleep and disease activity with circulating concentration of \u03b1-MSH, VIP and inflammatory cytokines.\nThere were 127 participants, 97 BD patients, and 30 healthy controls (HC). All completed the Multi-Dimensional Assessment of Fatigue questionnaire (MAF) and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) on the day of their clinical assessment. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) were used to evaluate the serum concentrations of \u03b1-MSH, VIP and cytokines (IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-\u03b1).\n64% of BD patients experienced high fatigue scores, and 63% had poor quality of sleep. When BD and HC were compared the MAF and PSQI scores as well as the serum concentrations of \u03b1-MSH, VIP, and IL-6 were significantly higher in BD (p values were: 0.001, 0.001, 0.001, 0.004 and 0.036, respectively). Both \u03b1-MSH and IL-6 had significant impact on MAF and PSQI. Interestingly, VIP had a significant influence on PSQI and disease activity, but not on MAF.\nA better understanding of these complex clinical and biochemical interactions between \u03b1-MSH, VIP and IL-6 might lead to the development of novel approaches to manage fatigue and sleep disorders as well as disease activity in BD patients.", "Epidemiological studies have reported that highly fluoridated drinking water may significantly decrease the Intelligence Quotient (IQ) of exposed children. It is thought that synaptic plasticity is the basis of learning and memory skills in developing children. However, the effect on synaptic plasticity by activated microglia induced via fluoride treatment is less clear. Our previous research showed that fluoride ions activated microglia which then released pro-inflammatory cytokines. In this study, hippocampal-dependent memory status was evaluated in rat models sub-chronically exposed to fluoride in their drinking water. Microglial activation in the hippocampus was examined using immunofluorescence staining and the expression of synaptophysin (SYP) and postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95), Long-term potentiation (LTP) and the expression of Amino-3-hydroxy-5-methy-4-isoxazole propionate (AMPA) receptor subunit GluR2 as well as N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor subunit NMDAR2\u03b2 of exposed rats. We found that fluoride exposure activated microglia and increased the expression of DAP12 and TREM2, as well as promoted pro-inflammatory cytokines secretion via ERK/MAPK and P38/MAPK signal pathways. Furthermore fluoride depressed LTP and decreased PSD-95 protein levels as well as expression of ionotropic glutamate receptors GluR2 and NMDAR2\u03b2. We concluded that the role of fluoride on synaptic plasticity may be associated with neuroinflammation induced by microglia.", "Pioneering advances have been made in Internet of Things technologies (IoT) in healthcare.

The patients also underwent magnetic resonance imaging analysis for the cranial region. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood samples, and the 12 exons and flanking regions of the GCDH gene were amplified with PCR and subjected to direct DNA sequencing. One hundred healthy newborns were used as controls.\nMutations of the GCDH gene were identified in all of the 3 patients. Two patients have carried compound heterozygous mutations including c.1244-2A>C and c.1147C>T(p.R383C), c.406G>T(p.G136C) and c.1169G>A(p.G390E), respectively. One has carried homozygous c.1244-2A>C mutation. The same mutations were not detected among the 100 healthy newborns. Only one patient received early intervention and did not develop the disease. The other two had irreversible damagesto their intelligence.\nc.1169G>A(p.G390E) is likely pathogenic mutations for GA I patients from Fujianarea. Early screening of neonatal metabolic diseases is crucial for such patients.", "Service members are at risk for unintentional drownings or near drownings during training, occupational activities, and off-duty recreation. During 2013-2017, there were 359 incident accidental drowning episodes (includes drownings and near drownings) for a crude rate of 5.7 cases per 100,000 person-years. Compared with their respective counterparts, the overall incidence rates of drowning episodes were highest among males, those aged 29 years or younger, those who were unmarried, and enlisted service members. Across the services, crude overall rates were highest among Marine Corps and Navy members and lowest among Air Force members. Overall rates of drowning episodes were highest among those working in motor transport and lowest among those in repair/engineering or communications/intelligence occupations. The overall rate of drowning episodes among service members with any history of alcohol-related disorder was nearly twice that of those without any history of alcohol-related disorder. Between 2015 and 2017, annual rates of drowning episodes decreased in each service, with the greatest decline observed among Navy and Marine Corps members. The results of this report may be useful to increase awareness regarding the ongoing risks and effects of drowning episodes among U.S. service members.", "Presents an obituary of Leon J.

Over the course of his career, Kamin demonstrated a rare combination of skills as a researcher, scholar, and administrator. Early in his career, Kamin developed an influential line of research on conditioning. In fact, a conditioning effect, the Kamin (blocking) effect, is named after him. Later in his career, he became interested in the heritability of intelligence, leading to his debunking of Cyril Burt's famous twin studies and the publication of his extremely influential book The Science and Politics of IQ (1974).

All infants with an open defect were delivered by elective Cesarean section and underwent early repair of the spinal defect. A ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt and/or third ventriculostomy was performed when needed. Complete postnatal follow-up was carried out by our multidisciplinary team in the majority of cases. The cohort was analyzed in two groups: Group 1 included patients referred between February 1980 and December 1999; Group 2 included patients referred between January 2000 and December 2015.\nThere was a total of 222 cases of SB with a prenatal diagnosis rate of 94.6% (n\u2009=\u2009210), with the majority of defects being meningomyeloceles (n\u2009=\u2009142 (64.0%)), affecting the lumbosacral level (n\u2009=\u2009110 (49.5%)) and being \u2265\u20092\u2009cm in size (n\u2009=\u2009163/195 (83.6%)).

Worse motor function was associated with progressive prenatal ventriculomegaly, level of lesion and VP shunt placement.\nWe describe the prenatal diagnosis, natural history and long-term outcome of a large contemporary cohort of SB fetuses and infants. In an era of pioneering fetal surgical techniques for in-utero SB repair, it is important to acknowledge that advances in conventional neonatology and pediatric neurosurgery have allowed increased life expectancy and improved quality of life in patients with SB. Copyright \u00a9 2018 ISUOG. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.", "Recent advances in the field of artificial intelligence have revealed principles about neural processing, in particular about vision. Previous work demonstrated a direct correspondence between the hierarchy of the human visual areas and layers of deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) trained on visual object recognition. We use DCNN to investigate which frequency bands correlate with feature transformations of increasing complexity along the ventral visual pathway. By capitalizing on intracranial depth recordings from 100 patients we assess the alignment between the DCNN and signals at different frequency bands. We find that gamma activity (30-70\u2009Hz) matches the increasing complexity of visual feature representations in DCNN. These findings show that the activity of the DCNN captures the essential characteristics of biological object recognition not only in space and time, but also in the frequency domain. These results demonstrate the potential that artificial intelligence algorithms have in advancing our understanding of the brain.", "Nodal metastasis of a primary tumor influences therapy decisions for a variety of cancers. Histologic identification of tumor cells in lymph nodes can be laborious and error-prone, especially for small tumor foci.\nTo evaluate the application and clinical implementation of a state-of-the-art deep learning-based artificial intelligence algorithm (LYmph Node Assistant or LYNA) for detection of metastatic breast cancer in sentinel lymph node biopsies.\nWhole slide images were obtained from hematoxylin-eosin-stained lymph nodes from 399 patients (publicly available Camelyon16 challenge dataset). LYNA was developed by using 270 slides and evaluated on the remaining 129 slides. We compared the findings to those obtained from an independent laboratory (108 slides from 20 patients/86 blocks) using a different scanner to measure reproducibility.\nLYNA achieved a slide-level area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC) of 99% and a tumor-level sensitivity of 91% at 1 false positive per patient on the Camelyon16 evaluation dataset. We also identified 2 \"normal\" slides that contained micrometastases. When applied to our second dataset, LYNA achieved an AUC of 99.6%. LYNA was not affected by common histology artifacts such as overfixation, poor staining, and air bubbles.\nArtificial intelligence algorithms can exhaustively evaluate every tissue patch on a slide, achieving higher tumor-level sensitivity than, and comparable slide-level performance to, pathologists. These techniques may improve the pathologist's productivity and reduce the number of false negatives associated with morphologic detection of tumor cells. We provide a framework to aid practicing pathologists in assessing such algorithms for adoption into their workflow (akin to how a pathologist assesses immunohistochemistry results).", "We aimed to determine whether individual differences in manual dexterity are associated with specific language skills (nonword repetition, receptive vocabulary, and receptive grammar) after controlling for nonverbal abilities (visual-spatial working memory and intelligence).\nWe assessed manual dexterity using the pegboard task and examined relationships with verbal and nonverbal abilities in a diverse community sample of children (N = 63, mean age = 8;2 [year;months], range: 6;0-10;8) varying in language ability (Comprehensive Evaluation of Language Fundamentals-Fourth Edition core language score M = 105, range: 62-126; Semel, Wiig, & Secord, 2003).\nCorrelational analyses indicated significant relationships between manual dexterity and performance on tests of nonword repetition, receptive vocabulary, receptive grammar, and nonverbal intelligence, after controlling for multiple comparisons. In regression analyses, manual dexterity remained a significant predictor of nonword repetition after controlling for nonverbal abilities and age. In contrast, manual dexterity was no longer significant in predicting receptive vocabulary or grammar when nonverbal intelligence was included as a factor in the model.\nThese findings build on prior work implicating poor fine motor control in child language disorders by identifying a robust relationship between manual dexterity and nonword repetition. Relationships between manual dexterity and receptive language abilities appear to be indirect and mediated by nonword repetition. For clinicians, the results underscore the importance of screening children with poor fine motor control for concomitant language impairments.", "Although approximate number system (ANS) has been found to predict mathematics ability, it remains unclear if both aspects of ANS (symbolic and non-symbolic estimation) contribute equally well to mathematics performance and if their contribution varies as a function of the mathematics outcome and grade level. Thus, in this study, we examined the effects of both aspects of ANS on different mathematics skills across three grade levels. Three hundred eleven children (100 children from kindergarten, 107 children from Grade 2, and 104 children from Grade 4) from two kindergartens and three elementary schools in Shanghai, China, were assessed on measures of ANS (dot estimation and number line estimation), general cognitive ability (nonverbal intelligence, inhibition, and working memory), and mathematics abilities (numerical operations and mathematical problem solving in all grades, early mathematical skills in kindergarten, and calculation fluency in Grades 2 and 4). Results of hierarchical regression analyses showed that, in kindergarten, non-symbolic estimation predicted all mathematics skills even after controlling for age, gender, and general cognitive ability. In Grades 2 and 4, symbolic estimation accounted for unique variance in mathematical problem solving, but not in calculation fluency. Symbolic estimation also predicted numerical operations in Grade 4. Taken together, these findings suggest that in the early phases of mathematics development different aspects of ANS contribute to different mathematics skills.", "Cognitive decline in late life is a crucial health problem. It is important to understand the consistency and change of older adults' cognitive function in late life. Data for older adults (78 years and above) from the Health and Retirement Study (N\u2009=\u20091680) were used to explore meaningful subtypes of cognitive function and transitions patterns between those profiles across times. Age, gender, levels of education and nursing home were incorporated as covariates to explore the association between these variables and cognitive function transition pattern. Three cognitive function subgroups (Normal Cognitive Function, Fluid Intelligence Impairment and Cognitive Impairment) were identified. Individuals in Normal Cognitive Function status had a high probability to convert to the Fluid Intelligence Impairment status whereas the Cognitive Impairment status appeared a predominant tendency for stability. Increasing age played a significant role in fluid intelligence impairment and cognitive impairment process. Female and individuals with nursing home might be at higher risk of subsequent fluid intelligence impairment, while higher education did not protect against fluid intelligence impairment. These findings highlighted the usefulness to adopt a person-centered approach rather than a variable-centered approach, suggesting directions for future research and tailored interventions approaches to older adults with particular characteristics.", "In a large and comprehensively assessed sample of patients with bipolar disorder type I (BDI), we investigated the prevalence of psychotic features and their relationship with life course, demographic, clinical, and cognitive characteristics. We hypothesized that groups of psychotic symptoms (Schneiderian, mood incongruent, thought disorder, delusions, and hallucinations) have distinct relations to risk factors.\nIn a cross-sectional study of 1342 BDI patients, comprehensive demographical and clinical characteristics were assessed using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID-I) interview. In addition, levels of childhood maltreatment and intelligence quotient (IQ) were assessed. The relationships between these characteristics and psychotic symptoms were analyzed using multiple general linear models.\nA lifetime history of psychotic symptoms was present in 73.8% of BDI patients and included delusions in 68.9% of patients and hallucinations in 42.6%. Patients with psychotic symptoms showed a significant younger age of disease onset (\u03b2 = -0.09, t = -3.38, p = 0.001) and a higher number of hospitalizations for manic episodes (F11 338 = 56.53, p < 0.001). Total IQ was comparable between groups. Patients with hallucinations had significant higher levels of childhood maltreatment (\u03b2 = 0.09, t = 3.04, p = 0.002).\nIn this large cohort of BDI patients, the vast majority of patients had experienced psychotic symptoms. Psychotic symptoms in BDI were associated with an earlier disease onset and more frequent hospitalizations particularly for manic episodes. The study emphasizes the strength of the relation between childhood maltreatment and hallucinations but did not identify distinct subgroups based on psychotic features and instead reported of a large heterogeneity of psychotic symptoms in BD.", "Individual differences in educational attainment are linked to differences in intelligence, and predict important social, economic, and health outcomes. Previous studies have found common genetic factors that influence educational achievement, cognitive performance and total brain volume (i.e., brain size). Here, in a large sample of participants from the UK Biobank, we investigate the shared genetic basis between educational attainment and fine-grained cerebral cortical morphological features, and associate this genetic variation with a related aspect of cognitive ability. Importantly, we execute novel statistical methods that enable high-dimensional genetic correlation analysis, and compute high-resolution surface maps for the genetic correlations between educational attainment and vertex-wise morphological measurements. We conduct secondary analyses, using the UK Biobank verbal-numerical reasoning score, to confirm that variation in educational attainment that is genetically correlated with cortical morphology is related to differences in cognitive performance. Our analyses relate the genetic overlap between cognitive ability and cortical thickness measurements to bilateral primary motor cortex as well as predominantly left superior temporal cortex and proximal regions. These findings extend our understanding of the neurobiology that connects genetic variation to individual differences in educational attainment and cognitive performance.", "The main aim of the current research was evaluation of concurrent validity of the Goodenough-Harris Draw-A-Man Test (GHDAMT) with the problem-solving subscale of ASQ2 among children between 54-60 months old in Tabriz City, northwestern Iran.\nIn this cross-sectional study, 136 males and 105 females were selected by simple random sampling from nursery schools in Tabriz City, northwestern Iran in 2014 and tested with GHDAMT and ASQ2 to compare the concurrent validity of these tests in evaluation of cognition. Data were analyzed using Pearson or Spearman correlation coefficients and SPSS.16.\nThe mean Intelligence Quotient (IQ) in girls was 128\u00b118.18 and in boys 118\u00b118.50, and the difference was statistically significant P<0.001. There was no statistically significant correlation between GHDAMT and ASQ2 .The statistical correlation was significant between IQ and mental age among children who had -2SD score in problem-solving subscale, but there was no statistical correlation between children who had -1SD score P<0.002. There was no statistically significant correlation between problem-solving subscale of ASQ2 and mental age and IQ.\nGHDAMT did not have acceptable validity and concurrent validity of the test was less than 0.3. So GHDAMT cannot be used as a substitute of ASQ questionnaire. However, the correlation of two tests in children with intellectual and developmental disability was significant. After doing more studies in further research, it is possible to use GHDAMT as a proper tool for cognition evaluation of these children.", "The female gender has been considered a risk factor for cognitive impairment in pediatric brain tumor survivors. However, it is still unknown which specific cognitive domains are at greater risk of impairment in females. The aim of this study was to explore differences between male and female children in distinct domains of cognitive functioning, in order to deepen knowledge on the topic.\nThe cognitive performance of 100 males and 71 females aged 6-16\u00a0years was assessed by Wechsler Intelligence Scales for Children-Third Edition (WISC-III). Differences between males and females were tested not only on intellectual quotients, but also on WISC-III subtests, which allow the evaluation of different cognitive domains. Analyses were performed in the whole sample and dividing children based on the supratentorial vs. infratentorial location of the tumor.\nGender was the only predictor of VIQ in the whole group and in children with supratentorial tumor. Female children with supratentorial tumor performed significantly worse than males in four out of six verbal subtests. However, even among children with infratentorial tumor, females performed worse than males on two verbal subtests.\nOverall, findings of this study suggest that females may have more difficulties than males at manipulating verbal oral material. A possible explanation of these findings could be that females present a greater vulnerability to white matter damage due to the illness and post-adjuvant therapies, in line with reports of the literature on female children with lymphoblastic leukemia.", "Patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) and reduced left ventricle ejection fraction benefit from cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) and implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD). However, increasing numbers of patient with CRT and ICD devices produce overload of cardiology centers where patients are admitted to ambulatory visits. This study aims to find multivariate model predicting the requirement for ambulatory follow-up of cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs).The LUCY study is an observational, cohort, prospective, 2-stage trial. As equal number of patients (300) will be included in the first and the second part of the study, finally, 600 patients will be included in the study. The inclusion criteria will be: age between 18 and 90 years, CHF (New York Heart Association classes I-III) and implanted ICD or CRT at least 30 days before study inclusion. The exclusion criteria will be dementia and other conditions impeding cooperation during the study. All patients included in the study will undergo standard ambulatory visit. Primary endpoint will be defined as any ambulatory visit qualified as necessary due to patient's condition or device malfunction diagnose by the cardiologist: any change in pharmacotherapy related to patient's clinical status assessed during the visit, any change in tachyarrythmia counter or discriminator status, any change in tachyarrythmia threshold, presence of ventricular undersensing or oversensing, presence of atrial or ventricular ineffective pacing, or device's pocket infection. Secondary endpoint will be defined as any ambulatory visit qualified as necessary due to the alarm identified via Medtronic CareLink Express (MCLE): sustained or treated ventricular tachyarrythmia, any not previously diagnosed supraventricular tachyarrythmia, or elective replacement indicator.Our study is the first attempt of implementation of the machine learning and elements artificial intelligence in health care optimization of patients with CIED. The LUCY will be an open product, available for additional testing and improvement with supplementary functionalities: quality of life assessment, teleconsultation, video-streaming, automated imagine recognizing.", "This study seeks to define the role of predictive values of the motor speed, inhibition control, and fluid and crystallized intelligence in estimating the cortical thickness in healthy elderly. Forty-six older healthy subjects (37 women, 9 men) over 60\u00a0years of age were included in the study. The participants were examined on 3.0\u00a0T MRI scanners. The protocol included standard anatomical sequences, to exclude brain pathology, and a high-resolution T1-weighted sequence used to estimate the cortical thickness. The neuropsychological protocol included fluid intelligence assessment (Raven Progressive Matrices), crystalized intelligence assessment (information or vocabulary subtest of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised (WAIS-R)), and executive functioning (Color Traits Test). The findings unraveled several interdependencies. The higher the intelligence, the thicker was the grey matter in nine regions of both hemispheres, but also some paradoxical reversed associations were found in four areas; all of them were localized along different sections of the cingulate gyrus in both hemispheres. An inverse association was found between crystallized intelligence and the thickness of the pars opecularis of the right hemisphere. The better the executive functioning, the thicker was the grey matter of a given region. The better the motor performance, the thicker was the grey matter of the rostral middle frontal area of the left hemisphere and the lingual gyrus of both hemispheres. In conclusion, the associations unraveled demonstrate that the neural mechanisms underlying healthy aging are complex and heterogenic across different cognitive domains and neuroanatomical regions. No brain aging theory seems to provide a suitable interpretative framework for all the results. A novel, more integrative approach to the brain aging should be considered.", "In our study, we aimed to evaluate the serum homocysteine levels, pyridoxine, folate and vitamin B12 levels in children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorders (ADHD).\nThis study included 30 newly diagnosed drug-naive children with ADHD (23 males and 7 female, mean age 9.3\u00b11.8 years) and 30 sex-and age matched healthy controls. The diagnosis of ADHD was made according to DSM-V criteria. Children and adolescents were administered the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School Aged Children, Present and Lifetime Version, the Conners' Parent Rating Scale-Revised, Long Form, the Conners' Teacher Rating Scale and the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children Revised (WISC-R) for all participants. Homocysteine, pyridoxine, folate and vitamin B12 levels were measured with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.\nHomocysteine, pyridoxine, folate and vitamin B12 levels were significantly lower in children with ADHD compared with their controls (p<0.05). A positive significant correlation was observed between the all WISC-R scores and vitamin B12 level in patients (r=0.408, p=0.025).\nThe results obtained in this study showed that reduced homocysteine, pyridoxine, folate and vitamin B12 levels could be a risk factor in the etiology of ADHD.", "Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) and Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) from the clandestine intelligence sector are being increasingly employed in infectious disease outbreaks. The purpose of this article is to explore how such tools might be employed in the detection, reporting, and control of outbreaks designated as a 'threat' by the global community. It is also intended to analyse previous use of such tools during the Ebola and SARS epidemics and to discuss key questions regarding the ethics and legality of initiatives that further blur the military and humanitarian spaces.\nWe undertake qualitative analysis of current discussions on OSINT and SIGINT and their intersection with global health. We also review current literature and describe the debates. We built on quantitative and qualitative research done into current health collection capabilities.\nThis article presents an argument for the use of OSINT in the detection of infectious disease outbreaks and how this might occur.\nWe conclude that there is a place for OSINT and SIGINT in the detection and reporting of outbreaks. However, such tools are not sufficient on their own and must be corroborated for the intelligence to be relevant and actionable. Finally, we conclude that further discussion on key ethical issues needs to take place before such research can continue. In particular, this involves questions of jurisdiction, data ownership, and ethical considerations.", "18F-FDG-PET/CT has become a standard for assessing treatment response in patients with lymphoma. A subjective interpretation of the scan based on the Deauville 5-point scale has been widely adopted. However, inter-observer variability due to the subjectivity of the interpretation is a limitation. Our main goal is to develop an objective and automated method for evaluating response. The first step is to develop and validate an artificial intelligence (AI)-based method, for the automated quantification of reference levels in the liver and mediastinal blood pool in patients with lymphoma.\nThe AI-based method was trained to segment the liver and the mediastinal blood pool in CT images from 80 lymphoma patients, who had undergone 18F-FDG-PET/CT, and apply this to a validation group of six lymphoma patients. CT segmentations were transferred to the PET images to obtain automatic standardized uptake values (SUV). The AI-based analysis was compared to corresponding manual segmentations performed by two radiologists.\nThe mean difference for the comparison between the AI-based liver SUV quantifications and those of the two radiologists in the validation group was 0\u00b702 and 0\u00b702, respectively, and 0\u00b702 and 0\u00b702 for mediastinal blood pool respectively.\nAn AI-based method for the automated quantification of reference levels in the liver and mediastinal blood pool shows good agreement with results obtained by experienced radiologists who had manually segmented the CT images. This is a first, promising step towards objective treatment response evaluation in patients with lymphoma based on 18F-FDG-PET/CT.", "Recent bold, eye-catching headline predictions made by nonradiologists, e.g., \"in a few years, radiology will disappear\" and \"stop training radiologists now,\" are not only far from reality but also irresponsible and a disservice to the appropriate implementation and adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) technology to health care. It is highly likely and foreseeable that AI will enhance the quality and efficiency of the current clinical practice across many specialties and even render some activities in clinical practice obsolete.", "Machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence which aims to improve machine with the ability of extracting knowledge from the environment. Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is one of the most common and aggressive primary malignant brain tumors in adults. Due to a low rate of survival in patients with these tumors, machine learning can help physicians for better decision-making. The aim of this paper is to develop a machine learning model for predicting the survival rate of patients with GBM based on clinical features and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).\nThe present investigation is an observational study conducted to predict the survival rate in patients with GBM in 12 months. Fifty-five patients who were registered in five Iranian Hospitals (Tehran) during 2012-2014 were selected in this study.\nThis study used Cox and C5.0 decision tree models based on clinical features and combined them with MRI. Accuracy, sensitivity, and specification parameters used to evaluate the models. The result of Cox and C5.0 for clinical feature was <32.73%, 22.5%, 45.83%>, <72.73%, 67.74%, 79.19%>, respectively; also, the result of Cox and C5.0 for both features was <60%, 48.58%, 75%>, <90.91%, 96.77%, 88.33%>, respectively.\nUsing C5.0 decision tree model in both survival models including clinical features, both the imaging features and the clinical features as the covariates, shows additional predictive values and better results. The tumor width and Karnofsky performance status scores were determined as the most important parameters in the survival prediction of these types of patients.", "With the advent of intelligence, more and more machines and devices involve the creation of complex structures. In the intelligent manufacturing industries, moldings including injection molding, blow molding, compression molding and others play critical roles in manufacturing the highly precise parts required for building intelligent machines (such as computers, cell phones, robots, etc.). The performance of the clamping mechanism directly affects the quality of the microstructure of injection products. The design of injection molding mold clamping mechanism is based on the microstructure characteristics of the trip of toggle lever mechanism ratio, speed ratio, and force amplification ratio. These are used to study the main performance parameters, such as analysis, as well as for the establishment of the physical model of the clamping mechanism. The model is based on the microstructure of injection of hyperbolic elbow clamping mechanism kinematics simulation. Simulation results and the theoretical calculation contrast analysis shows that the maximum dynamic template speed is 215.34 mm/s. The dynamic templates and crosshead speed ratio is 2.15, therefore the design of injection molding mold clamping mechanism for microstructure provides favorable technical support. The method described here is important to build complicated molds required to build highly precise parts to build intelligent machineries.", "As genetic testing gains ground in medicine, the ability to search across the suite of biomedical and clinical care databases offered through the National Library of Medicine/National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)-such as PubMed, GENE, Structure, the Genetic Testing Registry, and others-holds the potential to enhance quality of clinical care best practices. \"Plutchik\" is a voice-enabled, embodied artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot that can perform highly technical medical searches in and across the NCBI suite of databases.", "This paper compares structured history, auditory processing abilities and neuropsychological findings of children with functional hearing loss (FHL) to those with suspected auditory processing disorder without FHL (control). The main aim was to evaluate the value of a holistic assessment protocol for FHL used in a routine pediatric audiology clinic. The protocol incorporated a commercially available test battery for auditory processing disorder (APD), non-verbal intelligence (NVIQ) and tools to screen for common co-existing neurodevelopmental conditions such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), language impairment (LI) and developmental coordination disorder (DCD). The outcome of such holistic assessment was expected to help in understanding the nature of FHL and to provide individualized support to mitigate their difficulties.\nThis retrospective study compared two groups, 40 children (M\u202f=\u202f17, F\u202f=\u202f23) in each group between seven and sixteen years of age, one group with a history of FHL and the other with suspected APD without FHL (control). The groups were matched against age, gender, hand use, diagnosis of APD or non-APD (31 with APD and 9 without APD in each group) and non-verbal intelligence. All the children were healthy English speaking children attending mainstream schools with no middle or inner ear abnormalities. Structured history was obtained from parents regarding different nonacademic and academic concerns. The SCAN-3:C and SCAN-3:A test batteries were used to assess auditory processing abilities; Lucid Ability test for NVIQ; Children's Communication Checklist-2 (CCC-2) for language ability; Swanson Nolan and Pelham-IV Rating Scale (SNAP-IV) for ADHD; and the manual dexterity components of the Movement Assessment Battery for Children-2 (MABC-2) as a screening tool for DCD.\nAbout 60% of children in both the groups had concerns regarding listening in noisy background. In the history, poor attention was reported in 45% of children in the FHL group compared to 82.5% in the control group (p\u202f<\u202f0.01). Hyperacusis was present in 35% of children in the FHL group and in 62% of children in the control group (p\u202f<\u202f0.05). Concerns about overall academic abilities were present in 59% of children in the FHL group and 75% of the controls (p\u202f>\u202f0.05). Only 15% of children in the FHL group had concerns with numeracy skills in contrast to 41% of the controls (p\u202f<\u202f0.05). Significantly fewer (p\u202f<\u202f0.01) children in the FHL group (41%) received additional support at school than the controls (75%). Fewer children performed poorly in Filtered Words (FW) test of the SCAN-3 batteries, 30% in the FHL group and 17.5% in the control group, in contrast to Auditory Figure Ground 0 (AFG0), 85% in FHL and 80% in the control group. The number of children performing poorly in AFG0 was significantly higher compared to all the other SCAN-3 tests in FHL (P\u202f<\u202f0.05), in contrast to FW and Competing Sentences (CS) only in the control group (p\u202f<\u202f0.05). The control group had higher prevalence of atypical ear advantage (AEA) in left directed Competing Words (CW) (32.5%) and Time Compressed Sentences (TCS) (32.5%) compared to FW (7.5%). In contrast, FHL group had higher prevalence of AEA in AFG0 (48.7%) compared to CS (21%). High proportions of children in both the groups had LI (80% in FHL and 82.5% in the control group), with significantly lower (p\u202f<\u202f0.05) levels of ADHD symptoms in the FHL group (39.5%) compared to the control group (72.5%). Impaired manual dexterity was present in 30.7% of children in FHL group and 47.5% in the controls.\nThe prevalences of APD and language impairment are high compared to ADHD symptoms in children with FHL, and holistic assessment is recommended. Despite some similarities in the auditory and neuropsychological profiles between children with FHL and those with suspected APD without FHL some differences were noted. The results suggest that children with FHL have genuine difficulties that need to be identified and addressed. Future research is required to identify the neural pathways which could explain the similarities and dissimilarities between the two groups.", "Lacking quantitative evaluations of competing risk data of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), we aimed to evaluate the probability of NPC- and other cause-specific mortality (NPC-SM; OCSM) and develop competing risk nomograms to quantify survival differences.\nUsing the institutional big-data intelligence platform, 7251 NPC patients undergoing intensity-modulated radiotherapy between 2009-2014 were identified to establish nomograms based on Fine and Gray's competing risk analysis.\nThe 5-year NPC-SM and OCSM of the cohort were 13.1% and 1.2%, respectively, and elevated 5-year OCSMs were observed in patients aged \u226565\u202fyears (5.5%) or with severe comorbidities (4.3%). Age was most predictive of OCSM: patients aged 55-64 and \u226565\u202fyears exhibited subdistribution hazard ratios (SHRs) of 2.70 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.64-4.4; P\u202f<\u202f.001) and 5.78 (95% CI, 3.32-10.08; P\u202f<\u202f.001), respectively. Comorbidity measured using the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) was also strongly predictive of OCSM: patients with CCI scores of 1 and \u22652 exhibited SHRs of 2.33 (95% CI, 1.46-3.71; P\u202f<\u202f.001) and 2.58 (95% CI, 1.16-5.73; P\u202f=\u202f.020), respectively. All validated factors were integrated into the competing nomograms: age, sex, histology type, tumor and node stages, plasma Epstein-Barr virus-DNA level, lactate dehydrogenase level, and C-reactive protein (CRP) level into the NPC-SM model (concordance [c]-index\u202f=\u202f0.743); and age, CCI, Albumin level, and CRP level into the OCSM model (c-index\u202f=\u202f0.793).\nOCSM represents a significant competing event for NPC-SM in elderly patients and patients with comorbidities. We present the first prognostic nomograms to quantify competing risks, which may help to tailor individualized treatment.", "This article was migrated. The article was marked as recommended. There is over a century of research on selection and recruitment and the field has both developed and expanded significantly over this time. Previous research has tended to focus on reviewing the effectiveness of selection methods (academic records, references, personal statements, aptitude tests, personality assessments, situational judgement tests, and interviews), where good quality evidence is now emerging. Many challenges remain however, reflecting that selection and recruitment into medical education (both undergraduate and postgraduate) is a complex, multi-dimensional, dynamic phenomenon. For example, issues regarding diversity and fairness in selection have been researched over many years but there remains a huge gap between the research evidence and policy enactment in many parts of the globe. In this opening editorial for our special issue on selection and recruitment in medical education we encourage authors to consider six key question areas (amongst others), including: \u2022how will technology (e.g. social media, big data, artificial intelligence, etc) influence selection research and practices in future?\u2022should selection criteria be reviewed to include creativity, innovation, resilience and adaptability (beyond heavy reliance on prior academic attainment as the main criterion)?\u2022is selection for medical education fair? How do we address issues regarding widening participation and diversity in practice?\u2022to what extent do political, cultural and social factors influence selection philosophy and policies internationally?\u2022what are the risks to effective selection (e.g. access to coaching, legal challenge of poor practices) and,\u2022a new Ottawa consensus on selection and recruitment has been published - to what extent does this statement reflect your experiences of designing and implementing selection systems in your locality? In contributing to the debate, this special issue provides a platform for authors to present the latest research, empirical studies, systematic reviews, reflections, case studies and practical tips on current/future issues in selection and recruitment in medical education.", "Adaptation, cooperation, and trust are at the center of rehabilitation. Artificial intelligence and robots enhance adaptation with guidance for movement, cues for sensation, control of environment, and improved situational awareness.

This study aimed to evaluate cognitive function and personality traits in patients with epilepsy with the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Chinese revised and Eysenck Personality Questionnaire and investigate the underlying influencing factors. Compared with the control group, our results showed that patients with epilepsy were presented with significant cognitive impairment and particular personality traits. Epileptic seizure-related factors including earlier age of onset, longer duration of epileptic history, and higher seizure frequency were significantly associated with the observed defects in cognition and personality traits. In addition, the temporal lobe was more likely to affect cognition and personality, and the left hemisphere was closely related to verbal intelligence quotient, which needs to be the focus of future research. These results will be instrumental for guiding the treatment of epilepsy.", "Little is known about long-term outcomes. We investigate the adaptive trajectories and their risk factors in ASD. Data were obtained from 281 children prospectively followed untill adulthood. The final sample consisted of 106 individuals. Vineland scores were collected at baseline (T1), 3 (T2), 10 (T3), and 15 (T4) years later. A group-based method was used to identify homogeneous patterns of adaptive skills trajectories. Results show that among the children initially categorized as autistic, 82.6% remained over the ADOS diagnostic threshold, 11.9% converted to atypical autism, and 5.4% fell under the ADOS threshold. Most atypical autism diagnoses were unstable. Most (81.7%) autistic participants had an ID at inclusion. At T1, 59.3% were nonverbal, but only 39% at T4. Most changes occurred between 4 and 8 years of age. Approximately 25% of participants exhibited a \"high\" growth trajectory, in which progress continues throughout adolescence, and 75% a \"low\" growth trajectory, characterized by greater autistic symptoms, intellectual disability, and lower language abilities reflected by high CARS scores, low apparent DQ, and speech difficulties, which mostly, but not always, predicted low trajectories. Our findings suggest that the adaptive prognosis of autism is mostly poor in this cohort, biased toward intellectual disability. However, changes in diagnostic, speech, and adaptive status are not uncommon, even for indivduals with low measured intelligence or apparent intellectual disability, and are sometimes difficult to predict. Autism Research 2018, 11: 1455-1467. \u00a9 2018 International Society for Autism Research, Wiley Periodicals, Inc. LAY SUMMARY: Most autism diagnoses given before 5 years of age are stable to adulthood, but one-fifth of individuals are no longer considered to be autistic, even in a cohort biased toward apparent intellectual disability. Conversely, atypical autism diagnoses are mostly unstable. One-third of children who are nonverbal at 5 years are verbal within 15 years, mostly before 8 years of age. Concerning adaptive behavior outcomes, only one-fourth of children exhibit a high-growth trajectory through at least 15 years.", "Cognitive reserve may mitigate the degree of cognitive deficit observed in Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), confounding attempts to fully characterize the nature of these deficits. In this study, cognitive reserve was examined as a potential moderator of neurocognitive deficits in MDD. Unmedicated, currently depressed patients with MDD (n\u202f=\u202f269), and healthy volunteers (n\u202f=\u202f143) were compared on measures assessing psychomotor speed, interference processing, verbal memory, visual memory, and executive functioning. Moderating effects of education level and estimated intelligence level were examined as interactions, along with age, in a regression model for each test. Differences between patients and non-patients were found with most measures, and sustained in regression models as main effects. However, the interaction of estimated intelligence and patient status was significant for processing speed, verbal memory, visual memory, and executive functioning, with patient/non-patient differences diminishing with higher estimated intelligence. Neither estimated intelligence nor education level impacted interference processing differences, which were reduced with increasing age. Better intellectual ability moderates the effect of MDD on neurocognitive test performance. This effect may confound attempts to characterize these deficits in higher functioning samples. More challenging tasks may be needed, given the potential predictive value of neurocognition for differential therapeutic and clinical outcomes.", "Patchable devices that interface with the skin across a wide range of size scales, from cellular level down to molecular level, become increasingly attractive in biomedical research. These devices hold the potential for diagnostic and therapeutic functions with exceptional spatiotemporal precision, continuity, and convenience. Further, they afford new opportunities to integrate cloud-based technology and artificial intelligence for a smarter healthcare system. This article reviews recent advances in materials design and assembly techniques for fabricating various patchable devices, with focuses on electrical, thermal, mechanical, and chemical biosensors as well as transdermal gene and drug delivery platforms. A concluding discussion provides perspectives for future developments and outlooks in clinical applications.", "Despite evidence that variation exists between individuals in high-stakes truth and deception detection accuracy rates, little work has investigated what differences in individuals' cognitive and emotional abilities contribute to this variation. Our study addressed this question by examining the role played by cognitive and affective theory of mind (ToM), emotional intelligence (EI), and various aspects of attention (alerting, orienting, executive control) in explaining variation in accuracy rates among 115 individuals (87 women; mean age = 27.04 years [ SD = 11.32]) who responded to video clips of truth-tellers and liars in real-world, high-stakes contexts. Faster attentional alerting supported truth detection, and better cognitive ToM and perception of emotion (an aspect of EI) supported deception detection. This evidence indicates that truth and deception detection are distinct constructs supported by different abilities. Future research may address whether interventions targeting these cognitive and emotional traits can also contribute to improving detection skill.", "Internet gaming disorder (IGD) has become a topic of increasing research interest since its inclusion in Section 3 of the DSM-5. Given the lack of clinical studies concerning IGD, exploring the characteristics of clinical samples with IGD will help to delineate the gaming disorder construct and inform future treatment studies.\nData collection consisted of clinical interviews comprising 31 male adolescents diagnosed with IGD. Alongside the clinical interviews, the participants were administered a battery of psychometric tests assessing the following: IGD, personality traits, comorbid symptomatology, emotional intelligence (EI), and family environment characteristics.\nThe results showed that the adolescents with IGD and their relatives reported a high number of hours per week and high presence of stressful life events in the majority of the sample. High scores on scales assessing depression, anxiety, and somatic disorders were found. However, the findings indicate the presence of several other comorbid disorders meaning that some of the adolescent sample with IGD had different clinical profiles. Several personality traits were found to be highly associated with IGD including introversion, inhibition, submissiveness, self-devaluation, interpersonal sensibility, obsessive-compulsive tendencies, phobic anxiety, and hostility, as well as paranoid and borderline personality traits. Other negative characteristics found in the present sample included a high level of social problems, low EI, and dysfunctional family relationships.\nThe findings suggest a more global pattern of key psychological characteristics associated with Internet gaming disorder in adolescence. This may help in understanding the complexity of this proposed disorder and it may also help in designing more specialized interventions for adolescents with IGD. The findings have important implications for clinical practice and interventions.", "Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are often supported in daily life by visual presentations such as picture cards or illustrations. Therefore, they are considered to have visual strength. However, whether people with ASD are cognitively superior in visual processing and what causes the difference between visual and other sensory processing remain unknown. Thus, we compared visual and auditory processing from an aspect of memory in people with ASD and controls. We conducted the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised (WMS-R) with 64 adults with ASD and 30 controls matched for gender, age, and Full Scale Intelligence Quotient (FIQ). Our results showed that participants with ASD were inferior in visual working memory (P < .01), on a task in which a visual target was pointed every second. Another visual memory, namely, Visual Reproduction in which four geometric figures were presented each by 10 sec, and auditory memory, including working memory, revealed no significant differences between groups. Other visual memory, namely, Visual Paired Associates in which paired presentations were shown every 3 sec, had weak differences (P = .019). Thus, people with ASD might have difficulties processing rapid visual information. Autism Res 2018, 11: 1245-1252. \u00a9 2018 International Society for Autism Research, Wiley Periodicals, Inc. LAY SUMMARY: Autistic people are often supported by visual presentations. In this study, we inspected whether they have visual superiority. We showed that they were not visually superior in cognitive aspects, and were poor not at auditory but at visual working memory. Static visual memory in which memorization time is longer than that in working memory was intact in autism. Unusual rapid visual presentation may bother people with autism.", "Early childhood nutritional interventions typically combine nutritional and psychosocial stimulation. Such combined interventions result in long-lasting improvements of cognitive abilities in children who are malnourished. Here, we investigated potential cognitive abilities in normally developing children in Indonesia who were, however, at risk for suboptimal cognitive development due to little psychosocial stimulation in their home environment. In a randomized controlled intervention, children of the experimental group received nutritional supplementation combined with cognitive stimulation. Pre- and post-intervention measurements included cognitive development and functioning, behavior, and mother\u207bchild interaction. The experimental and control group received nutritional supplementation in the form of a fortified or unfortified milk powder, respectively. Additionally, the children and parents of the experimental group jointly engaged in daily learning activities at home and performed iPad-based tasks designed to foster cognitive abilities. The experimental group compared to the control group displayed a significantly higher increase in intelligence quotient as well as a significantly larger reduction in attentional problems after the intervention. These results indicate that low-level cognitive stimulation in combination with nutritional supplementation during early childhood can be an effective intervention that improves global cognitive functioning in healthy developing children. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02359669.", "This study evaluates the effectiveness of an artificial neural network-genetic algorithm (ANN-GA) artificial intelligence (AI) model in the prediction of behavior and optimization of an electro-oxidation pilot press-type reactor, which treats a synthetic wastewater prepared with a dye. The ANN was built from real experimental data using as input the following variables: time, flow, j, dye concentration, and as output discoloration. The performance of the ANN was measured with MAPE (8.3868%), calculated from real and predicted values. The coupled AI model was used to find the best operational conditions: discoloration efficiency (above 90%) at j = 27 mA/cm2 and dye concentration of 230 mg/L.", "Interventions including social scaffolding and metacognitive strategies have been used in educational settings to promote cognition. In addition, increasing evidence shows that computerized process-based training enhances cognitive skills. However, no prior studies have examined the effect of combining these two training strategies. The goal of this study was to test the combined effect of metacognitive scaffolding and computer-based training of executive attention in a sample of typically developing preschoolers at the cognitive and brain levels. Compared to children in the regular training protocol and an untrained active control group, children in the metacognitive group showed larger gains on intelligence and significant increases on an electrophysiological index associated with conflict processing. Moreover, changes in the conflict-related brain activity predicted gains in intelligence in the metacognitive scaffolding group. These results suggest that metacognitive scaffolding boosts the influence of process-based training on cognitive efficiency and brain plasticity related to executive attention.", "Intelligence is an important individual difference factor related to mental health, academic achievement, and life success, yet there is a lack of research into its early cognitive predictors. This study investigated the predictive value of infant developmental assessment scores for school-age intelligence in a large, heterogeneous sample of single- and twin-born subjects (N = 521). We found that Early Learning Composite (ELC) scores from the Mullen Scales of Early Learning have similar predictive power to that of other infant tests. ELC scores at age 2 were predictive of Stanford-Binet abbreviated intelligence (ABIQ) scores at age 6 (r = 0.46) even after controlling for sex, gestation number, and parental education. ELC scores at age 1 were less predictive of 6-year ABIQ scores (r = 0.17). When the sample was split to test robustness of findings, we found that results from the full sample replicated in a subset of children born at \u226532 weeks gestation without birth complications (n = 405), though infant cognitive scores did not predict IQ in a subset born very prematurely or with birth complications (n = 116). Scores at age 2 in twins and singletons showed similar predictive ability for scores at age 6, though twins had particularly high correlations between ELC at age 1 and ABIQ at age 6.", "We have already reported that medical students who have prior knowledge of classical Greek and Latin perform better in anatomy examinations. It has also been shown that fluency in more than one language can influence spatial and verbal intelligence and here we hypothesize that medical students who have linguistic skills develop higher spatial and verbal intelligence compared with monolingual students, that there are gender differences, and that there are positive effects on performance in anatomy examinations. One hundred and seventy-three second year medical students at Cardiff University responded to spatial and verbal intelligence questions that were adapted from the British MENSA website. This is a 63% response rate for the student cohort. The students were then categorized into different groups depending upon their linguistic knowledge and skills. Across all groups, no gender differences were discerned for either spatial or verbal intelligence. Students who were categorized as monolingual (with only skills in English) had lower spatial and verbal intelligence than those who were multilingual. Medical students who had fluency in English and non-European languages showed greater spatial and verbal intelligence than other groups. However, there was no significant improvement in their examination marks for anatomy, although the examination performance might be complicated by cultural considerations. A further finding from our study was that, where an anatomy test required spatial recognition using cadaveric specimens, students with low spatial intelligence had significantly poorer performances. Furthermore, where tests used multiple choice questions, the level of spatial and verbal intelligences had no influence. We would advocate that, when all newly-recruited medical students are tutored in medical terminologies to help them develop the extensive vocabulary required for their professional careers, they should also be made aware of any deficiencies in spatial and verbal skills that could affect their learning abilities. Given that we would expect students to benefit in their careers from developing spatial and verbal skills, we also recommend that examination tests in anatomy should avoid the exclusive use of multiple choice questions. Clin. Anat., 2018. \u00a9 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.", "Recent revisions to the diagnostic criteria for Alzheimer's disease (AD) incorporated conceptual advances in the field. Specifically, AD is now recognized to encompass a continuum, spanning from preclinical (accruing brain pathology in the absence of symptoms) through symptomatic predementia (prodromal AD, mild cognitive impairment) and dementia phases. The role of biological markers (biomarkers) of both the underlying molecular pathologies and related neurodegenerative changes has also been acknowledged. In this abridged review, we provide an overview of fluid (cerebrospinal fluid and blood) and molecular imaging-based biomarkers used within the field and discuss the potential role of computer driven artificial intelligence approaches for both the early and accurate identification of AD and as a tool for population enrichment in clinical trials testing candidate disease modifying therapies.", "To examine the hypoglycaemic effect on neurodevelopmental outcome in patients with transient and persistent congenital hyperinsulinism (CHI) born in the 21st century.\nA cohort of 117 patients (66 males, 51 females) with CHI aged 5 to 16\u00a0years (mean age 8y 11mo, SD 2y 7mo) were selected from a Finnish nationwide registry to examine all the patients with similar methods. Neurodevelopment was first evaluated retrospectively. The 83 patients with no risk factors for neurological impairment other than hypoglycaemia were recruited and 44 participated (24 males, 20 females; mean age 9y 7mo, SD 3y 1mo) in neuropsychological assessment with the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, Fourth Edition and the Finnish version of the Developmental Neuropsychological Assessment, Second Edition domains of attention, language, memory, sensorimotor, and visual functioning.\nIn retrospective analysis, transient and persistent CHI groups had similar prevalences of mild (22% and 18% respectively) or severe (5% and 7% respectively) neurodevelopmental difficulties. In clinical assessment, the neurocognitive profile was within the average range in both groups, but children with persistent CHI showed significant but restricted deficits in attention, memory, visual, and sensorimotor functions compared with the general population. The transient CHI group did not differ from the standardization samples.\nBesides the more apparent broader neurological deficits, children with persistent CHI have an increased risk for milder specific neurocognitive problems, which should be considered in the follow-up.\nChildren with persistent congenital hyperinsulinism showed deficits in attention, memory, visual, and sensorimotor functions. The deficits were potentially of hypoglycaemic origin. Children with transient hyperinsulinism did not differ from the general population.\nEL EFECTO DE LA HIPOGLUCEMIA SOBRE EL RESULTADO NEUROCOGNITIVO EN NI\u00d1OS Y ADOLESCENTES CON HIPERINSULINISMO CONG\u00c9NITO TRANSITORIO O PERSISTENTE: OBJETIVO: Examinar el efecto hipogluc\u00e9mico sobre el resultado del neurodesarrollo en pacientes nacidos en el siglo XXI con hiperinsulinismo cong\u00e9nito (HIC) transitorio y persistente.

Applications of artificial intelligence (AI) and cognitive computing offer promise in diabetes care. The purpose of this article is to better understand what AI advances may be relevant today to persons with diabetes (PWDs), their clinicians, family, and caregivers. The authors conducted a predefined, online PubMed search of publicly available sources of information from 2009 onward using the search terms \"diabetes\" and \"artificial intelligence.\" The study included clinically-relevant, high-impact articles, and excluded articles whose purpose was technical in nature. A total of 450 published diabetes and AI articles met the inclusion criteria. The studies represent a diverse and complex set of innovative approaches that aim to transform diabetes care in 4 main areas: automated retinal screening, clinical decision support, predictive population risk stratification, and patient self-management tools. Many of these new AI-powered retinal imaging systems, predictive modeling programs, glucose sensors, insulin pumps, smartphone applications, and other decision-support aids are on the market today with more on the way. AI applications have the potential to transform diabetes care and help millions of PWDs to achieve better blood glucose control, reduce hypoglycemic episodes, and reduce diabetes comorbidities and complications. AI applications offer greater accuracy, efficiency, ease of use, and satisfaction for PWDs, their clinicians, family, and caregivers.", "The authors assess the impact of rhinoplasty on public perception of a patient's appearance and personality.\nA survey was created using standardized before-and-after photographs of 10 Caucasian women who had undergone primary rhinoplasty. Photographs of two additional women who had not undergone facial surgery were randomly included as controls, for a total of 12 survey items. Preoperative and postoperative photographs were placed side by side. The survey was administered by means of crowd-sourcing. Respondents were asked to evaluate which photograph better represented 11 traits of appearance or personality, according to a seven-point Likert scale. A score of 1 meant the preoperative photograph was much better, 7 meant the postoperative photograph was much better, and 4 meant no difference. T tests and analyses of variance were used to evaluate rating changes for each trait and differences between demographic groups.\nThere were 264 responses received. Averaged scores across the 10 survey patients produced a value for each appearance or personality trait. In 10 of 11 categories (i.e., symmetry, youthfulness, facial harmony, likeability, trustworthiness, confidence, femininity, attractiveness, approachability, and intelligence), the postoperative photograph was significantly favorable compared with the preoperative photograph (p < 0.00001). The preoperative photograph was rated higher only in aggressiveness (p < 0.001). The same scores were calculated for the controls; no significant difference in any category was seen except confidence, where the right image was viewed as more confident (mean, 4.19; p < 0.005).\nAesthetic rhinoplasty improves the public perception of a person's appearance and personality in multiple aspects.", "Microscopic examination of Giemsa-stained blood films remains a major form of diagnosis in malaria case management, and is a reference standard for research. However, as with other visualization-based diagnoses, accuracy depends on individual technician performance, making standardization difficult and reliability poor. Automated image recognition based on machine-learning, utilizing convolutional neural networks, offers potential to overcome these drawbacks. A prototype digital microscope device employing an algorithm based on machine-learning, the Autoscope, was assessed for its potential in malaria microscopy. Autoscope was tested in the Iquitos region of Peru in 2016 at two peripheral health facilities, with routine microscopy and PCR as reference standards. The main outcome measures include sensitivity and specificity of diagnosis of malaria from Giemsa-stained blood films, using PCR as reference.\nA cross-sectional, observational trial was conducted at two peripheral primary health facilities in Peru. 700 participants were enrolled with the criteria: (1) age between 5 and 75\u00a0years, (2) history of fever in the last 3\u00a0days or elevated temperature on admission, (3) informed consent. The main outcome measures included sensitivity and specificity of diagnosis of malaria from Giemsa-stained blood films, using PCR as reference.\nAt the San Juan clinic, sensitivity of Autoscope for diagnosing malaria was 72% (95% CI 64-80%), and specificity was 85% (95% CI 79-90%). Microscopy performance was similar to Autoscope, with sensitivity 68% (95% CI 59-76%) and specificity 100% (95% CI 98-100%). At San Juan, 85% of prepared slides had a minimum of 600 WBCs imaged, thus meeting Autoscope's design assumptions. At the second clinic, Santa Clara, the sensitivity of Autoscope was 52% (95% CI 44-60%) and specificity was 70% (95% CI 64-76%). Microscopy performance at Santa Clara was 42% (95% CI 34-51) and specificity was 97% (95% CI 94-99). Only 39% of slides from Santa Clara met Autoscope's design assumptions regarding WBCs imaged.\nAutoscope's diagnostic performance was on par with routine microscopy when slides had adequate blood volume to meet its design assumptions, as represented by results from the San Juan clinic. Autoscope's diagnostic performance was poorer than routine microscopy on slides from the Santa Clara clinic, which generated slides with lower blood volumes. Results of the study reflect both the potential for artificial intelligence to perform tasks currently conducted by highly-trained experts, and the challenges of replicating the adaptiveness of human thought processes.", "Loss of pregnancy is a major stressor which can cause mental disorders. In stressful conditions, spiritual intelligence can be used as a coping strategy to manage and cope with the stressor. It may also produce positive outcomes in spontaneous abortion. This study aimed to assess the relationship of spiritual intelligence with depression after spontaneous abortion. This cross-sectional descriptive-correlational study was done in 2015-2016 on 185 women with spontaneous abortion who were hospitalized in the postnatal care ward of Kowsar teaching hospital, Qazvin, Iran. Data collection was performed in two steps. In the first step, a demographic and obstetric characteristics questionnaire and the Spiritual Intelligence Self-Report Inventory were completed by participants during their hospital stay. In the second step, i.e., 7\u00a0days after spontaneous abortion, the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale was completed for each participant over the phone. Variables which were found in univariate analysis to have a significant correlation with depression were entered into multiple logistic regression analysis to assess their roles in predicting depression. Most women were depressed (54%). Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that the significant predictors of depression were women's educational status (OR 0.419; CI 0.18-0.93), gestational age at the time of abortion (OR 1.121; CI 1.02-1.22), and the personal meaning production dimension of spiritual intelligence (OR 0.82; CI 0.73-0.91). Spiritual intelligence is significantly correlated with post-abortion depression. Developing and following strategies for promoting spiritual intelligence can alleviate depression, stress, and anxiety after spontaneous abortion and also help manage complicated pregnancies.", "Neurocognitive outcomes in children with perinatal stroke are complicated by additional neurological/medical factors. The main objective of this study was to retrospectively examine long-term neurocognitive outcomes in five children with perinatal stroke with increasingly complex comorbidities; ages 5-7 at first evaluation. Results revealed that intelligence and academic skills were significantly decreased in cases with combined perinatal stroke and comorbidities. Early language development was particularly vulnerable to disruption over time in children with increasing medical complexity. The delayed emergence of neurocognitive deficits emphasizes the need for serial assessment of neurocognitive development to identify early services and interventions.", "Prior research on emotional intelligence (EI) has highlighted the use of incremental models that assume EI and general intelligence (or g) make independent contributions to performance. Questioning this assumption, we study EI's moderation power over the relationship between g and individual performance, by designing and testing a task-dependent interaction model. Reconciling divergent findings in previous studies, we propose that whenever social tasks are at stake, g has a greater effect on performance as EI increases. By contrast, in analytic tasks, a compensatory (or negative) interaction is expected, whereby at higher levels of EI, g contributes to performance at a lesser extent. Based on a behavioral approach to EI, using 360-degree assessments of EI competencies, our findings show that EI moderates the effect of g on the classroom performance of 864 MBA business executives. Whilst in analytic tasks g has a stronger effect on performance at lower levels of EI competencies, our data comes short to show a positive interaction of EI and g in affecting performance on social tasks. Contributions and implications to research and practice are discussed.", "Artificial intelligence holds great promise in transforming how drugs are designed and patients are treated. In a study recently published in Science Translational Medicine, a unique artificial intelligence platform makes efficient use of small experimental datasets to design new drug combinations as well as identify the best drug combinations for specific patient samples. This quadratic phenotypic optimization platform (QPOP) does not rely on previous assumptions of molecular mechanisms of disease, but rather uses system-specific experimental data to determine the best drug combinations for a specific disease model or a patient sample. In this commentary, we explore how QPOP was applied toward multiple myeloma in the study. We also discuss how this study demonstrates the potential for applications of QPOP toward improving therapeutic regimen design and personalized medicine.", "Recognizing the relationship of keen observation to communication, critical thinking, and leadership in evidence-based literature, educators have expanded the use of art museums to augment visual intelligence skills. The purpose of this pilot intervention was to evaluate an innovative, interdisciplinary approach for integrating visual intelligence skills into an advanced communications and collaboration course.\nCollaborating with museum educators, the intervention for doctoral students was conducted at the National Gallery of Art. The aims were to explore and evaluate observation skills, use of intentional language in communication, impact of visual intelligence on perception, and role of visual intelligence with empathy.\nDescriptive and nonparametric statistics highlighted significant differences in pre- to post-assessment scores related to the expansiveness of intentional visual observation, alternate views, perception and empathy, suggesting that visual intelligence training's impact can be identified and evaluated.\nHealthcare providers' ability to communicate effectively, including observing, listening, explaining, and empathizing, significantly impacts healthcare outcomes and patient perceptions of satisfaction. All educators have access to a variety of two-dimensional art and the opportunity to implement interdisciplinary learning experiences to enhance visual intelligence. The intervention was considered a successful new learning modality for advanced communications skills and was integrated into the curriculum.", "Little is known about neuropsychological outcomes of children who survived pediatric cardiac arrest (CA).\nTo describe the neuropsychological outcomes of CA survivors enrolled in the Therapeutic Hypothermia After Pediatric Cardiac Arrest In-Hospital (THAPCA-IH) and Out-of-Hospital (THAPCA-OH) trials and compare the results with the primary outcome measure for these trials.\nSecondary analysis of 222 CA survivors aged 1 to 18 years who received chest compressions for 2 minutes or more, remained comatose and required mechanical ventilation after return of circulation, and were enrolled in targeted temperature-management trials from 41 pediatric intensive care units.

Impairments (>2 SD below the mean for age) across neuropsychological measures ranged from 7% to 61%. Correlations between global cognitive and VABS-II scores were strong for younger children (Mullen, r\u2009=\u20090.69-0.87) but moderate for older children (r\u2009=\u20090.21-0.54 for the WASI). Of 111 children with favorable outcomes on VABS-II, 25.2% had global cognitive impairment and 30 of 35 older children (85.7%) had selective neuropsychological deficits.\nIn this prospectively evaluated cohort of pediatric CA survivors who were initially comatose, although 71.2% were classified as having favorable outcomes, significant neuropsychological deficits were identified in pediatric CA survivors who were classified as having favorable outcomes. The findings provide clinicians with a greater understanding of the spectrum of neuropsychological outcomes of pediatric CA survivors and the complex relationship between standardized caregiver-reported functional outcome measures incorporated in clinical trials and performance-based neuropsychological assessments.", "The term emotional intelligence was introduced by Salovey & Mayer. It is the individual's ability to perceive, evaluate and express emotions. It is also a set of abilities which enable an individual to function effectively and they are an important factor affecting the quality of life. The literature also has a synonymous concept of emotional competence which is a collection of already acquired skills used in specific social situations. Major depressive disorder represents an affective disorder having an impact on a human being's ability to regulate emotions. In their course, there are difficulties with adequate recognition of one's emotional states as well as emotional states of other people. Research indicates, among others, the relationship between emotional intelligence and the occurrence of suicidal thoughts and tendencies, prognosis of therapeutic interactions in patients. A high level of emotional intelligence is a protective factor in the occurrence of mental disorders, including depression, affects the treatment process and influences the creation of effective strategies for coping with stress. The paper presents reports on the level of emotional intelligence and its impact on the functioning of patients with major depressive disorders.", "For many biological functions membrane proteins (MPs) are considered crucial. Due to this nature of MPs, many pharmaceutical agents have reflected them as attractive targets. It bears indispensable importance that MPs are predicted with accurate measures using effective and efficient computational models (CMs). Annotation of MPs using in vitro analytical techniques is time-consuming and expensive; and in some cases, it can prove to be intractable. Due to this scenario, automated prediction and annotation of MPs through CM based techniques have appeared to be useful. Based on the use of computational intelligence and statistical moments based feature set, an MP prediction framework is proposed. Furthermore, the previously used dataset has been enhanced by incorporating new MPs from the latest release of UniProtKB. Rigorous experimentation proves that the use of statistical moments with a multilayer neural network, trained using back-propagation based prediction techniques allows more thorough results.", "With the rapid progress in computer science, including artificial intelligence, big data and cloud computing, full-space spot generation can be pivotal to many practical applications, such as facial recognition, motion detection, augmented reality, etc. These opportunities may be achieved by using diffractive optical elements (DOEs) or light detection and ranging (LIDAR). However, DOEs suffer from intrinsic limitations, such as demanding depth-controlled fabrication techniques, large thicknesses (more than the wavelength), Lambertian operation only in half space, etc. LIDAR nevertheless relies on complex and bulky scanning systems, which hinders the miniaturization of the spot generator. Here, inspired by a Lambertian scatterer, we report a Hermitian-conjugate metasurface scrambling the incident light to a cloud of random points in full space with compressed information density, functioning in both transmission and reflection spaces. Over 4044 random spots are experimentally observed in the entire space, covering angles at nearly 90\u00b0. Our scrambling metasurface is made of amorphous silicon with a uniform subwavelength height, a nearly continuous phase coverage, a lightweight, flexible design, and low-heat dissipation. Thus, it may be mass produced by and integrated into existing semiconductor foundry designs. Our work opens important directions for emerging 3D recognition sensors, such as motion sensing, facial recognition, and other applications.", "To describe the structural brain changes, neurocognitive and mental health associations in adolescents perinatally infected with HIV-1 infection.\nCross-sectional.\nTwo hundred and four adolescents with perinatally acquired HIV and 44 uninfected frequency-matched controls aged 9-11 years were enrolled within the Cape Town Adolescent Antiretroviral Cohort. Diffusion tensor imaging and structural brain MRI was done to determine fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity, grey and white matter volumes, cortical thickness and cortical surfractional anisotropy area. Correlation coefficients were calculated between total grey and white matter volume, cortical surface area, cortical thickness, whole brain fractional anisotropy and whole brain mean diffusivity and clinical and laboratory parameters including general intellectual functioning, Becks Youth Inventory, Child Motivation Scale and Child Behaviour Checklist.\nHIV-infected adolescents performed worse than controls on the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI; P\u200a<\u200a0.01). HIV-infected adolescents had significant fractional anisotropy decreases, mean diffusivity increases and decreases in cerebral grey matter volumes, cortical surface area and decreased gyrification. Whole-brain mean fractional anisotropy was significantly reduced in the HIV-infected group (P\u200a=\u200a0.031). There were significant correlation coefficients between greater total grey (P\u200a=\u200a0.008) and white matter volume (P\u200a=\u200a0.004) with the WASI and the Becks self-concept subscale (P\u200a=\u200a0.038). Lower whole brain fractional anisotropy was associated with higher scores on the Becks anger (P\u200a=\u200a0.018) and disruptive behaviour subscales (P\u200a=\u200a0.031). Higher whole brain mean diffusivity was associated with apathy (P\u200a=\u200a0.046).\nThe pattern of increased risk of white matter microstructure alterations, smaller grey matter volumes, reduced cortical surface area and decreased gyrification, suggests abnormal neurodevelopment in perinatally infected younger adolescents.", "The practice of medicine is ever evolving. Diagnosing disease, which is often the first step in a cure, has seen a sea change from the discerning hands of the neighborhood physician to the use of sophisticated machines to use of information gleaned from biomarkers obtained by the most minimally invasive of means. The last 100 or so years have borne witness to the enormous success story of allopathy, a practice that found favor over earlier practices of medical purgatory and homeopathy. Nevertheless, failures of this approach coupled with the omics and bioinformatics revolution spurred precision medicine, a platform wherein the molecular profile of an individual patient drives the selection of therapy. Indeed, precision medicine-based therapies that first found their place in oncology are rapidly finding uses in autoimmune, renal and other diseases. More recently a new renaissance that is shaping everyday life is making its way into healthcare. Drug discovery and medicine that started with Ayurveda in India are now benefiting from an altogether different artificial intelligence (AI)-one which is automating the invention of new chemical entities and the mining of large databases in health-privacy-protected vaults. Indeed, disciplines as diverse as language, neurophysiology, chemistry, toxicology, biostatistics, medicine and computing have come together to harness algorithms based on transfer learning and recurrent neural networks to design novel drug candidates, a priori inform on their safety, metabolism and clearance, and engineer their delivery but only on demand, all the while cataloging and comparing omics signatures across traditionally classified diseases to enable basket treatment strategies. This review highlights inroads made and being made in directed-drug design and molecular therapy.", "Psychological research on people's understanding of natural language connectives has traditionally used truth table tasks, in which participants evaluate the truth or falsity of a compound sentence given the truth or falsity of its components in the framework of propositional logic. One perplexing result concerned the indicative conditional if A then C which was often evaluated as true when A and C are true, false when A is true and C is false but irrelevant\" (devoid of value) when A is false (whatever the value of C). This was called the \"psychological defective table of the conditional.\" Here we show that far from being anomalous the \"defective\" table pattern reveals a coherent semantics for the basic connectives of natural language in a trivalent framework. This was done by establishing participants' truth tables for negation, conjunction, disjunction, conditional, and biconditional, when they were presented with statements that could be certainly true, certainly false, or neither. We review systems of three-valued tables from logic, linguistics, foundations of quantum mechanics, philosophical logic, and artificial intelligence, to see whether one of these systems adequately describes people's interpretations of natural language connectives. We find that de Finetti's (1936/1995) three-valued system is the best approximation to participants' truth tables.", "The field of DNA intelligence focuses on retrieving information from DNA evidence that can help narrow down large groups of suspects or define target groups of interest. With recent breakthroughs on the estimation of geographical ancestry and physical appearance, the estimation of chronological age comes to complete this circle of information. Recent studies have identified methylation sites in the human genome that correlate strongly with age and can be used for the development of age-estimation algorithms. In this study, 110 whole blood samples from individuals aged 11-93 years were analysed using a DNA methylation quantification assay based on bisulphite conversion and massively parallel sequencing (Illumina MiSeq) of 12 CpG sites. Using this data, 17 different statistical modelling approaches were compared based on root mean square error (RMSE) and a Support Vector Machine with polynomial function (SVMp) model was selected for further testing. For the selected model (RMSE\u2009=\u20094.9 years) the mean average error (MAE) of the blind test (n\u2009=\u200933) was calculated at 4.1 years, with 52% of the samples predicting with less than 4 years of error and 86% with less than 7 years. Furthermore, the sensitivity of the method was assessed both in terms of methylation quantification accuracy and prediction accuracy in the first validation of this kind. The described method retained its accuracy down to 10\u2009ng of initial DNA input or \u223c2\u2009ng bisulphite PCR input. Finally, 34 saliva samples were analysed and following basic normalisation, the chronological age of the donors was predicted with less than 4 years of error for 50% of the samples and with less than 7 years of error for 70%.", "The recent US Food and Drug Administration approval of the marijuana constituent cannabidiol as safe and effective for treatment of 2 rare forms of epilepsy has raised hopes that others of the 500 chemicals in marijuana will be found to be therapeutic. However, the long-term consequences of street marijuana use are unclear, and recent studies raise red flags about its effects. Changes in brain maturation and intellectual function, including decreases in intelligence quotient, have been noted in chronic users and appear permanent in early users in most but not all studies. These studies suggest that at a minimum, regular marijuana use should be discouraged in individuals under the age of 21.", "Long-acting injectable second-generation antipsychotics (LAI-SGA) are typically used to maintain treatment adherence in patients with chronic schizophrenia. Recent research suggests that they may also provide an effective treatment strategy for patients with early-phase disease. The aim of this study is to evaluate clinical and psychosocial outcomes among recent and long-term diagnosed schizophrenia outpatients treated with LAI-SGA during a follow-up period of 12 months. Stable schizophrenia patients receiving LAI-SGA with 5 or less years of illness duration (n = 10) were compared to those with more than 5 years of illness duration (n = 15). Clinical data was assessed through the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), the Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF), the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS), the Recovery Style Questionnaire (RSQ), and the Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test (MSCEIT) Managing Emotion branch. Recently diagnosed patients showed greater improvement versus patients diagnosed for more than 5 years in adjusted mean GAF score, in PANSS factor score for negative and depressive symptoms, and in severity and intensity of suicidal ideation. Our preliminary findings support the hypothesis that LAI-SGA may influence the course of the illness if administered at the early phase of the illness. However, replicate studies are needed, possibly with larger samples.", "There is a disease epidemiological transition occurring in Africa, with increasing incidence of noninfectious diseases, superimposed on a health system historically geared more toward the management of communicable diseases. The persistence and sometimes emergence of new pathogens allows for the occurrence of coinfections and comorbidities due to both infectious and noninfectious diseases. There is therefore a need to rethink and restructure African health systems to successfully address this transition. The historical focus of more health resources on infectious diseases requires revision. We hypothesise that the growing burden of noninfectious diseases may be linked directly and indirectly to or further exacerbated by the existence of neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) and other infectious diseases within the population. Herein, we discuss the health burden of coinfections and comorbidities and the challenges to implementing effective and sustainable healthcare in Africa. We also discuss how existing NTD and infectious disease intervention programs in Africa can be leveraged for noninfectious disease intervention. Furthermore, we explore the potential for new technologies-including artificial intelligence and multiplex approaches-for diagnosis and management of chronic diseases for improved health provision in Africa.", "Sleep spindles are related to sleep-dependent memory consolidation and general cognitive abilities. However, they undergo drastic maturational changes during adolescence. Here we used a longitudinal approach (across 7 years) to explore whether developmental changes in sleep spindle density can explain individual differences in sleep-dependent memory consolidation and general cognitive abilities. Ambulatory polysomnography was recorded during four nights in 34 healthy subjects (24 female) with two nights (baseline and experimental) at initial recording (age range 8-11 years) and two nights at follow-up recording (age range 14-18 years). For declarative learning, participants encoded word pairs with a subsequent recall before and after sleep. General cognitive abilities were measured by the Wechsler Intelligence Scale. Higher slow (11-13 Hz) than fast (13-15 Hz) spindle density at frontal, central, and parietal sites during initial recordings, followed by a shift to higher fast than slow spindle density at central and parietal sites during follow-up recordings, suggest that mature spindle topography develops throughout adolescence. Fast spindle density increases from baseline to experimental night were positively related to sleep-dependent memory consolidation. In addition, we found that the development of fast spindles predicted the improvement in memory consolidation across the two longitudinal measurements, a finding that underlines a crucial role for mature fast spindles for sleep-dependent memory consolidation. Furthermore, slow spindle changes across adolescence were related to general cognitive abilities, a relationship that could indicate the maturation of frontal networks relevant for efficient cognitive processing.

However the evidence supporting a specific clinical pathway for a patient or patient population is often imperfect limiting adoption and efficacy of clinical pathway. Machine intelligence can potentially identify clinical variation and may provide useful insights to create and optimize clinical pathways. In this quality improvement project we analyzed the inpatient care of 1786 patients undergoing colorectal surgery from 2015 to 2016 across multiple Ohio hospitals in the Cleveland Clinic System. Data from four information subsystems was loaded in the Clinical Variation Management (CVM) application (Ayasdi, Inc., Menlo Park, CA). The CVM application uses machine intelligence and topological data analysis methods to identify groups of similar patients based on the treatment received. We defined \"favorable performance\" as groups with lower direct variable cost, lower length of stay, and lower 30-day readmissions. The software auto-generated 9 distinct groups of patients based on similarity analysis. Overall, favorable performance was seen with ketorolac use, lower intra-operative fluid use (<\u20092000\u00a0cc) and surgery for cancer. Multiple sub-groups were easily created and analyzed. Adherence reporting tools were easy to use enabling almost real time monitoring. Machine intelligence provided useful insights to create and monitor care pathways with several advantages over traditional analytic approaches including: (1) analysis across disparate data sets, (2) unsupervised discovery, (3) speed and auto-generation of clinical pathways, (4) ease of use by team members, and (5) adherence reporting.", "The main aim of present study was to develop a model that specifies the predictive effects of some character strengths in depression. Two hundred individuals with major depression were recruited from clinical psychology centers. Participants completed a battery of questionnaires measuring dysfunctional attitudes, basic emotions, character strengths, and depression. Seven character strengths of critical thinking, emotional intelligence, gratitude, forgiveness, hope, spirituality, and zest were selected to measure the latent variable of character strengths. Structural equation modeling was used to analyze the data. Normed chi-square, comparative fit index, incremental fit index, and other indices demonstrated an adequate fit for the model suggesting that character strengths had an indirect effect on depression through the mediation of dysfunctional attitudes, negative affect, and happiness. Character strengths had negative effects on dysfunctional attitudes and positive effects on happiness. The findings of present study have implications for practitioners and researchers to develop an integrative model for the treatment of depression.", "Report change in Emotional Intelligence Appraisal scores among three cohorts of student pharmacists before and after completing the Leadership Degree Option (LDO) Program within the University of Oklahoma College of Pharmacy.\nThe first three cohorts of student pharmacists who elected to enroll in the College's LDO completed the self-administered Emotional Intelligence Appraisal, Me Edition, at the start of the LDO program and again three years later at the end of the program. Paired samples t-test compared differences between mean pre- and post-scores stratified by gender.\nA total of 36 students from Cohorts 1, 2, and 3 completed and voluntarily reported their scores of the Emotional Intelligence Appraisal. There was a statistically significant increase in mean overall Emotional Intelligence Appraisal score between the start and end of the LDO (pre\u202f=\u202f76.39, post\u202f=\u202f81.03, p\u202f<\u202f0.0001). Statistical significance remained when stratified by gender. There also were statistically significant differences on various sub-domain scores.\nWe observed a before and after increase in Emotional Intelligence Appraisal scores among three cohorts of pharmacy students who completed a three-year LDO Program in parallel with completing the Doctor of Pharmacy Degree Program. Emotional recognizance and management in oneself and others has potential to build leadership capacity that can be applied in the health-care delivery setting.", "This study examines the relationship between trait emotional intelligence (trait EI) and general health (General Health; GHQ-28) in two samples of Greek parents with (n = 52; Mage = 39.78; SDage = 6.68; 41 men and 11 women) and without (n = 51; Mage = 43.53; SDage = 4.61; 40 men and 11 women) addiction problems. In addition, it compares the trait EI scores of their offspring (N = 81; Mage = 11.71; SDage = 2.15; 51 boys and 30 girls). Results showed that parents with drug addiction exhibited lower levels of trait EI and poorer general health than peers. In addition, global trait EI and two of its subscales, Well-being and Emotionality, had stronger correlations with depression in the addiction than in the comparison group. Well-being was a significant predictor of general health and its subscales (Somatic symptoms, Anxiety/insomnia, Social dysfunction, and severe depression) in both groups. No differences were found between the offspring of the two groups.", "This article critically compares transformational leadership and ethical leadership. It discusses the differences, similarities, weaknesses and strengths of the two styles. The importance of strong leadership in meeting an array of challenges and changes occurring in the NHS is highlighted. The article explores the influence of transformational and ethical leadership styles on the role of nurse leaders, particularly those in mental health, and also the influence of emotional intelligence in leadership. Over the last five decades, there has been a transformation in mental health, but more needs to be done to ensure everyone can access high-quality care when they need it. Transformational leadership remains important in such an ever-changing healthcare environment, but ethical behaviour should be its base.", "To investigate to what extent locus of control, self-esteem, psychological distress, physical exercise, as well as socio-demographic factors are associated with obesity in 42-year-old adults in a longitudinal birth cohort study.\nThe sample consisted of 5645 participants born in Great Britain in 1970 and followed up at 10, 34 and 42 years with data on body mass index measured at 34 and 42 years.\nThere was an increase of adult obesity from 15.5% at age 34 to 21.2% at 42 years. Locus of control and self-esteem measured at age 10 years, psychological distress and educational qualifications assessed at age 34, and current occupational levels and physical exercise were all significantly associated with adult obesity at age 42. The associations remained significant after controlling for birth weight and gestation, maternal and paternal BMI, childhood BMI, and intelligence.\nChildhood locus of control and self-esteem, educational qualifications, psychological distress and physical exercise were all significantly and independently associated with adult obesity.", "We used contemporary psychometric theory of intelligence and confirmatory factor analysis to reanalyze data obtained on samples of nonhuman primates administered the Primate Cognition Test Battery. Our main goals were to interpret stability of the Primate Cognition Test Battery tasks and factors over time and to determine whether the cognitive factors that emerge from confirmatory factor analysis for apes can be interpreted from the perspective of a major theory of human intelligence, namely, the Cattell-Horn-Carroll model. We also analyzed data for 2\u00bd-year-old children on Wechsler's preschool test to afford a comparison between ape and child cognitive factors. Results indicated that multiple cognitive abilities provide the best factor solutions for both apes and children, and that the ape factors can be meaningfully interpreted from Cattell-Horn-Carroll theory.

Moreover, data generated online and by digital technologies -\u2009which the authors suggest be grouped under the term 'digitosome'\u2009- constitute, through the quantity and variety of information they represent, a powerful potential for identifying new digital markers and patterns of risk that, ultimately, when combined with clinical data, can improve diabetes management and quality of life, and also prevent diabetes-related complications. Moving from a world in which patients are characterized by only a few recent measurements of fasting glucose levels and glycated haemoglobin to a world where patients, healthcare professionals and research scientists can consider various key parameters at thousands of time points simultaneously will profoundly change the way diabetes is prevented, managed and characterized in patients living with diabetes, as well as how it is scientifically researched. Indeed, the present review looks at how the digitization of diabetes can impact all fields of diabetes -\u2009its prevention, management, technology and research\u2009- and how it can complement, but not replace, what is usually done in traditional clinical settings. Such a profound shift is a genuine game changer that should be embraced by all, as it can provide solid research results transferable to patients, improve general health literacy, and provide tools to facilitate the everyday decision-making process by both healthcare professionals and patients living with diabetes.", "As the practice of medicine evolves, the knowledge, skills and attitudes required to provide patient care will continue to change. These competency-based changes will necessitate the restructuring of assessment systems. High-quality assessment programmes are needed to fulfil health professions education's contract with society.\nWe discuss several issues that are important to consider when developing assessments in health professions education. We organise the discussion along the continuum of medical education, outlining the tension between what has been deemed important to measure and what should be measured. We also attempt to alleviate some of the apprehension associated with measuring evolving competencies by discussing how emerging technologies, including simulation and artificial intelligence, can play a role.\nWe focus our thoughts on the assessment of competencies that, at least historically, have been difficult to measure. We highlight several assessment challenges, discuss some of the important issues concerning the validity of assessment scores, and argue that medical educators must do a better job of justifying their use of specific assessment strategies.\nAs in most professions, there are clear tensions in medicine in relation to what should be assessed, who should be responsible for administering assessment content, and how much evidence should be gathered to support the evaluation process. Although there have been advances in assessment practices, there is still room for improvement. From the student's, resident's and practising physician's perspectives, assessments need to be relevant. Knowledge is certainly required, but there are other qualities and attributes that are important, and perhaps far more important. Research efforts spent now on delineating what makes a good physician, and on aligning new and upcoming assessment tools with the relevant competencies, will ensure that assessment practices, whether aimed at establishing competence or at fostering learning, are effective with respect to their primary goal: to produce qualified physicians.", "OBJECTIVEShunt surgery is the most common treatment for hydrocephalus, but it is associated with several long-term complications. Endoscopic choroid plexus coagulation (CPC) and endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) are alternative surgeries that may avoid the need for shunt surgery. Although the short-term efficacy and safety of CPC have been reported in previous studies, long-term outcome, including not only avoiding shunt placement but also intellectual development, remains to be elucidated. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the long-term outcome of CPC.METHODSThe study population comprised patients who had infantile hydrocephalus treated by endoscopic CPC before the age of 24 months and who were followed until at least 5 years of age. Retrospective review was performed using the medical charts. The authors assessed educational status and the full-scale intelligence quotient (FSIQ) using the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC) IV as the means to evaluate the intellectual development.RESULTSFourteen patients with infantile hydrocephalus underwent CPC with or without ETV as a primary surgery. There were no intraoperative complications. In 7 patients (50%), hydrocephalus was successfully controlled without shunt placement. Six patients (43%) eventually required shunt placement. In one patient hydrocephalus was controlled by additional ETV. In the shunt-independent group, 4 patients went to age-appropriate school or achieved age-appropriate development according to intelligence quotient (IQ), 1 patient went to specialized school, and 2 patients had disabilities. In the shunt-dependent group, 4 patients went to an age-appropriate school or achieved age-appropriate development by IQ, 1 patient went to specialized school, and 1 patient had disabilities. The mean FSIQ score in 3 patients without shunts was 90 (range 89-91) and the mean FSIQ score in 4 patients with shunts was 80 (range 48-107). There was no significant difference in the rate of normal development between the shunt-independent group and the shunt-dependent group (p = 0.72).CONCLUSIONSThe CPC with or without ETV can be a safe and effective treatment in children with infantile hydrocephalus. Long-term control of hydrocephalus and normal intellectual development can be achieved in successful cases. Further prospective studies should be required to elucidate appropriate indications.", "Personal Activity Intelligence (PAI) is a novel activity metric that translates heart rate variations during exercise into a weekly score. Weekly PAI scores assessed at a single point in time were found to associate with lower risk of premature cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality in the general healthy population. However, to date, the associations between long-term longitudinal changes in weekly PAI scores and mortality have not been explored.\nThe aim of the present study was to prospectively examine the association between change in weekly PAI scores estimated 10\u202fyears apart, and risk of mortality from CVD and all-causes.\nWe performed a prospective cohort study of 11,870 men and 13,010 women without known CVD in Norway. By using data from the Nord-Tr\u00f8ndelag Health Study (HUNT), PAI was estimated twice, ten years apart (HUNT1 1984-86 and HUNT2 1995-97). Mortality was followed-up until December 31, 2015. Adjusted hazard ratios (AHR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for death from CVD and all-causes related to temporal changes in PAI were estimated using Cox regression analyses.\nDuring a mean (SD) of 18 (4) years of follow-up, there were 4782 deaths, including 1560 deaths caused by CVD. Multi-adjusted analyses demonstrated that participants achieving a score of \u2265100 PAI at both time points had 32% lower risk of CVD mortality (AHR 0.68; CI: 0.54-0.86) for CVD mortality and 20% lower risk of all-cause mortality (AHR 0.80; CI: 71-0.91) compared with participants obtaining <100 weekly PAI at both measurements. For participants having <100 PAI in HUNT1 but \u2265100 PAI in HUNT2, the AHRs were 0.87 (CI: 0.74-1.03) for CVD mortality, and 0.86 (CI: 0.79-0.95) for all-cause mortality. We also found an inverse linear relationship between change in PAI and risk of CVD mortality among participants with 0 PAI (P\u202f<\u202f0.01), and \u226450 PAI (P\u202f=\u202f0.04) in HUNT1, indicating that an increase in PAI over time is associated with lower risk of mortality. Excluding the first three years of follow-up did not substantially alter the findings. Increasing PAI score from <100 PAI in HUNT1 to \u2265100 PAI in HUNT2 was associated with 6.6\u202fyears gained lifespan.\nAmong men and women without known CVD, an increase in PAI score and sustained high PAI score over a 10-year period was associated with lower risk of mortality.", "Exposure to a chemical is a critical consideration in the assessment of risk, as it adds real-world context to toxicological information. Descriptions of where and how individuals spend their time are important for characterizing exposures to chemicals in consumer products and in indoor environments. Herein we create an agent-based model (ABM) that simulates longitudinal patterns in human behavior. By basing the ABM upon an artificial intelligence (AI) system, we create agents that mimic human decisions on performing behaviors relevant for determining exposures to chemicals and other stressors. We implement the ABM in a computer program called the Agent-Based Model of Human Activity Patterns (ABMHAP) that predicts the longitudinal patterns for sleeping, eating, commuting, and working. We then show that ABMHAP is capable of simulating behavior over extended periods of time. We propose that this framework, and models based on it, can generate longitudinal human behavior data for use in exposure assessments.", "The emergence of flexible tool use is rare in the animal kingdom and thought to be largely constrained by either cognitive ability or ecological factors. That mostly birds with a high level of intelligence innovate tool use in captivity is consistent with the former hypothesis. We report here the first documented case of habitual tool use innovated in the wild by a bird species only known to have used tools in captivity. Trap-boxes containing food-bait and snap-trap(s) were installed in the remote Murchison Mountains, New Zealand, from 2002 to catch introduced stoats. Kea tampered with the trap-boxes in various ways. Over approximately 2.5 years, sticks were found inserted into at least 227 different trap-boxes that were up to 27\u2009km apart. Video footage confirmed that the stick insertion was kea tool use. Trap-boxes are unlikely to have provided the only possibility for kea tool use in their habitat given their extractive foraging and skilled object manipulation. We argue that they instead greatly facilitated the opportunity for tool use, thus increasing the chance that kea would invent the behaviour. The innovation of tool use by kea in response to facilitation provides rare field support for the cognitive constraints hypothesis.", "Interactions between the ways we process space, numbers and time may arise from shared and innate generic magnitude representations. Alternatively or concurrently, such interactions could be due to the use of physical magnitudes, like spatial extent, as metaphors for more abstract ones, like number and duration. That numbers might be spatially represented along a mental number line is suggested by the SNARC effect: faster left-side responses to small single digits, like 1 or 2, and faster right-side responses to large ones, like 8 or 9. Previously, we found that time estimation predicts mathematical intelligence and speculated that it may predict spatial ability too. Here, addressing this issue, we test-on a relatively large sample of adults and entirely within subjects-the relationships between (a) time: proficiency at producing and evaluating durations shorter than one second, (b) space: the ability to mentally rotate objects, (c) numbers: mathematical reasoning skills, and (d) space-number associations: the SNARC effect. Better time estimation was linked to greater mathematical intelligence and better spatial skills. Strikingly, however, stronger associations between space and numbers predicted worse mathematical intelligence and poorer time estimation.", "In light of the technological, social, and political changes taking place in the world today, it is important that nurses are not just culturally competent but globally informed and engaged.

This approach invites nurses and student nurses to discern new patterns, take charge of their learning, and build multiple iterations to facilitate the processing of new and different information and \"realities.\"", "Among the many regulators of microRNA formation, Argonaute 1 (AGO1) plays critical roles in RNA interference, which controls a wide range of biological activities. Recent large-scale genomic studies have identified at least five patients with intellectual disability/autism spectrum disorder who had de novo mutations in AGO1, but detailed clinical information was not available. The recognizable clinical features that are associated with AGO1 mutations remain to be determined. The proposita was a 15-year-old girl with diffuse hypotonia, infrequent seizures, and intellectual disability with an intelligence quotient of 41. She had characteristic facial features consisting of telecanthus, wide nasal bridge with bulbous nasal tip, and a round face with downslanted palpebral fissures. Serial computed tomography scans showed progressive calcification in the globus pallidus that became evident during childhood. A whole exome analysis in trio revealed a de novo heterozygous mutation in AGO1, i.e., c.595G\u202f>\u202fA p.(Gly199Ser). The distinctive facial features, i.e., telecanthus, wide nasal bridge with bulbous nasal tip, and a round face with downslanted palpebral fissures, closely resembled previously reported patients who had a chromosomal microdeletion encompassing AGO1 locus. The combinatory phenotype of such characteristic facial features and radiographic features, i.e. progressive calcification in the globus pallidus, in the presently reported patient suggest that AGO1 mutations lead to a syndromic form of intellectual disability/autism spectrum disorder. Distinctive facial features with early and progressive calcification in the globus pallidus may be suggestive of the presence of AGO1 mutations.", "Ophthalmology is a discipline that is highly dependent on the development of technology. Artificial intelligence is a new technological revolution, which will in all-round and fundamentally influence the progression of modern ophthalmology. Ophthalmologists should actively pay close attention to the development of artificial intelligence technology with great enthusiasm, and gradually realize the maximum utilization of artificial intelligence technology so as to facilitate the new development in ophthalmology. We should proactively seek for the opportunities of cooperating with the research organization and expert engineers in the area of artificial intelligence to promote the application of artificial intelligence in ophthalmology as soon as possible. Ophthalmology is likely to be radically changed by artificial intelligence technology.

Magnesium deficiency is common in the general population and its prevalence among patients with cirrhosis is even higher. Correlation between serum levels and total body content is poor because most magnesium is intracellular. Minimal hepatic encephalopathy is a subclinical phase of hepatic encephalopathy with no overt symptoms. Cognitive exams can reveal minor changes in coordination, attention, and visuomotor function, whereas language and verbal intelligence are usually relatively spared.\nTo assess the correlation between intracellular and serum magnesium levels and minimal hepatic encephalopathy.\nOutpatients with a diagnosis of compensated liver cirrhosis were enrolled in this randomized, double-blinded study. Patients were recruited for the study from November 2013 to January 2014, and were randomly assigned to a control (placebo) or an interventional (treated with magnesium oxide) group. Serum and intracellular magnesium levels were measured at enrollment and at the end of the study. Cognitive function was assessed by a specialized occupational therapist.\nForty-two patients met the inclusion criteria, 29 of whom were included in this study. Among these, 83% had abnormal cognitive exam results compatible with minimal hepatic encephalopathy. While only 10% had hypomagnesemia, 33.3% had low levels of intracellular magnesium. Initial intracellular and serum magnesium levels positively correlated with cognitive performance.\nMagnesium deficiency is common among patients with compensated liver cirrhosis. We found an association between magnesium deficiency and impairment in several cognitive function tests. This finding suggests involvement of magnesium in the pathophysiology of minimal hepatic encephalopathy.", "The late neurocognitive and psychosocial effects of treatment for pediatric brain tumor (PBT) represent important areas of clinical focus and ongoing research. Neurocognitive sequelae and associated problems with learning and socioemotional development negatively impact PBT survivors' overall health-related quality of life, educational attainment and employment rates. Multiple factors including tumor features and associated complications, treatment methods, individual protective and vulnerability factors and accessibility of environmental supports contribute to the neurocognitive and psychosocial outcomes in PBT survivors. Declines in overall measured intelligence are common and may persist years after treatment. Core deficits in attention, processing speed and working memory are postulated to underlie problems with overall intellectual development, academic achievement and career attainment. Additionally, psychological problems after PBT can include depression, anxiety and psychosocial adjustment issues. Several intervention paradigms are briefly described, though to date research on innovative, specific and effective interventions for neurocognitive late effects is still in its early stages. This article reviews the existing research for understanding PBT late effects and highlights the need for innovative research to enhance neurocognitive and psychosocial outcomes in PBT survivors.", "We build personalized relevance parameterization method (prep-ad) based on artificial intelligence (ai) techniques to compute Alzheimer's disease (ad) progression for patients at the mild cognitive impairment (mci) stage. Expressions of ad related genes, mini mental state examination (mmse) scores, and hippocampal volume measurements of mci patients are obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (adni) database. In evaluation of cognitive changes under pharmacological therapies, patients are grouped based on available clinical measurements and the type of therapy administered, namely donepezil monotherapy and polytherapy of donepezil with memantine. Average leave one out cross validation (loocv) error rates are calculated for prep-ad results as less than 8 percent when mmse scores are used to compute disease progression for a 60 month period, and 3 percent with hippocampal volume measurements for 12 months. Statistical significance is calculated as p = 0.003 for using ad related genes in disease progression and as for the results computed by prep-ad. These relatively small average loocv errors and p-values suggest that our prep-ad methods employing gene expressions, mmse scores and hippocampal volume loss measurements can be useful in supporting pharmacologic therapy decisions during early stages of ad.", "In the present study, the preparation of pharmaceutical mini-tablets was attempted in the framework of Quality by Design (QbD) context, by comparing traditionally used multi-linear regression (MLR), with artificially-intelligence based regression techniques (such as standard artificial neural networks (ANNs), particle swarm optimization (PSO) ANNs and genetic programming (GP)) during Design of Experiment (DoE) implementation. Specifically, the effect of diluent type and particle size fraction for three commonly used direct compression diluents (lactose, pregelatinized starch and dibasic calcium phosphate dihydrate, DCPD) blended with either hydrophilic or hydrophobic flowing aids was evaluated in terms of: a) powder blend properties (such as bulk (Y1) and tapped (Y2) density, Carr's compressibility index (Y3, CCI), Kawakita's compaction fitting parameters a (Y4) and 1/b (Y5)), and b) mini-tablet's properties (such as relative density (Y6), average weight (Y7) and weight variation (Y8)). Results showed better flowing properties for pregelatinized starch and improved packing properties for lactose and DPCD. MLR analysis showed high goodness of fit for the Y1, Y2, Y4, Y6 and Y8 with RMSE values of Y1\u202f=\u202f0.028, Y2\u202f=\u202f0.032, Y4\u202f=\u202f0.019, Y6\u202f=\u202f0.015 and Y8\u202f=\u202f0.130; while for rest responses, high correlation was observed from both standard ANNs and GP. PSO-ANNs fitting was the only regression technique that was able to adequately fit all responses simultaneously (RMSE values of Y1\u202f=\u202f0.026, Y2\u202f=\u202f0.022, Y3\u202f=\u202f0.025, Y4\u202f=\u202f0.010, Y5\u202f=\u202f0.063, Y6\u202f=\u202f0.013, Y7\u202f=\u202f0.064 and Y8\u202f=\u202f0.104).", "Teacher-child relationships have been linked to children's classroom engagement and to academic achievement. However, researchers have paid minimal attention to individual child factors that predict the development of these relationships. In the current study, we examined executive function (EF) prior to school entry as a predictor of teacher-child relationships at kindergarten through second grade. We also examined externalizing behavior problems, verbal intelligence, and academic achievement as mediators of these associations. Data were from the Family Life Project, a prospective, longitudinal sample of N = 1,292 families from predominantly low-socioeconomic status (SES) and rural communities in Pennsylvania and North Carolina. Children were administered a multidimensional battery of EF when they were 48 months old and standardized measures of verbal intelligence and academic achievement at prekindergarten. Parents reported on externalizing behavior problems when children were 60 months old. Kindergarten, first-, and second-grade teachers reported on teacher-child relationships. Growth curve models revealed that EF at 48 months positively predicted closeness and negatively predicted conflict with teachers in kindergarten but not change in closeness or conflict over time. Verbal intelligence mediated the associations between EF and both closeness and conflict. EF continued to significantly predict conflict, but not closeness, with kindergarten teachers when the mediator was included in the model. The results of this study are discussed in the context of the implications of children's self-regulation for classroom engagement in a low-SES sample.

Literature has linked these difficulties with emotional functioning as being an important factor related to the core aetiology ofeating disorders, however limited knowledge exists to how this impacts on professionalability to engage patients within treatment as a result of such dysfunction. Using aqualitative design this paper explores how facets of Emotional intelligence (EI) are related to the experience of an eating disorder. The study sampled a total of 32 participants with either a professional background working with eating disorders (n=27)or participants with personal lived experience (n=5), with a number of the participants (n=13) identified as having dual roles. The findings of the study show that aspects of EIsuch as emotional regulation and lack of an emotional language are considered to beat the core of the onset and maintenance of these disorders. Additional aspects of emotional awareness and expression were found to be related to treatment disengagement and difficulties. Building on previous literature, this paper found suchemotional deficits as a transdiagnostic issue rather than specifically anorexia nervosa. Furthermore, such dysfunction was seen by professionals to have a considerable impact on therapeutic relationships and successful treatment. These findings provide insight into the potential applications that EI may have in addressing aspects of theeating disorder to create better outcomes for treatment and intervention models.", "We adjust the Proof of Work (PoW) consensus mechanism used in Bitcoin and Ethereum so that we can build on its strength while also addressing, in part, some of its perceived weaknesses. Notably, our work is motivated by the high energy consumption for mining PoW, and we want to restrict the use of PoW to a configurable, expected size of nodes, as a function of the local blockchain state. The approach we develop for this rests on three pillars: (i) Proof of Kernel Work (PoKW), a means of dynamically reducing the set of nodes that can participate in the solving of PoW puzzles such that an adversary cannot increase his attack surface because of such a reduction; (ii) Practical Adaptation of Existing Technology, a realization of this PoW reduction through an adaptation of existing blockchain and enterprise technology stacks; and (iii) Machine Learning for Adaptive System Resiliency, the use of techniques from artificial intelligence to make our approach adaptive to system, network and attack dynamics. We develop here, in detail, the first pillar and illustrate the second pillar through a real use case, a pilot project done with Porsche on controlling permissions to vehicle and data log accesses. We also discuss pertinent attack vectors for PoKW\u00a0consensus and their mitigation. Moreover, we sketch how our approach may lead to more democratic PoKW-based blockchain systems for public networks that may inherit the resilience of blockchains based on PoW.", "There is emerging evidence that working memory (WM) can potentially be enhanced via targeted training protocols. However, the differential effects of targeted training of WM vs. training of general attentional processes on distinct neurocognitive mechanisms is not well understood. In the present study, we compared adaptive n-back WM training to an adaptive visual search training task that targeted perceptual discrimination, in the absence of demands on WM. The search task was closely matched to the n-back task on difficulty and participant engagement. The training duration for both protocols was 20 sessions over approximately 4\u202fweeks. Before and after training, young adult participants were tested on a battery of cognitive tasks to examine transfer of training gains to untrained tests of WM, processing speed, cognitive control, and fluid intelligence. Event-related brain potential (ERP) measures obtained during a Letter 3-Back task and a Search task were examined to determine the neural processes that were affected by each training protocol. Both groups improved on measures of cognitive control and fluid intelligence at post- compared to pretest. However, n-back training resulted in more pronounced transfer effects to tasks involving WM compared to search training. With respect to ERPs, both groups exhibited enhancement of P3 amplitude following training, but distinct changes in neural responses were also observed for the two training protocols. The search training group exhibited earlier ERP latencies at post- compared to pretest on the Search task, indicating generalized improvement in processing speed. The n-back group exhibited a pronounced enhancement and earlier latency of the N2 ERP component on the Letter 3-back task, following training. Given the theoretical underpinnings of the N2, this finding was interpreted as an enhancement of conflict monitoring and sequential mismatch identification. The findings provide evidence that n-back training enhances distinct neural processes underlying executive aspects of WM.", "Breast screening with mammography is widely recognized as the most effective method of detecting early breast cancer and has consistently demonstrated a 20-40% decrease in mortality among screened women. Despite this, the sensitivity of mammography ranges between 70 and 90%.

The authors report a case study of an academic medical center that aimed to understand barriers to voice and make improvements in identifying and responding to transgressive or disruptive behaviors.\nThe case study focused on an improvement effort at Johns Hopkins Medicine that sought to improve employee voice using a two-phase approach of diagnosis and intervention. Confidential interviews with 67 individuals (20 senior leaders, 47 frontline personnel) were conducted during 2014 to diagnose causes of employee reluctance to give voice about behavioral concerns. A structured intervention program to encourage voice was implemented, 2014-2016, in response to the findings.\nThe diagnostic interviews identified gaps between espoused policies of encouraging employee voice and what happened in practice. A culture of fear pervaded the organization that, together with widespread perceptions of futility, inhibited personnel from speaking up about concerns. The intervention phase involved four actions: sharing the interview findings; coordinating and formalizing mechanisms for identifying and dealing with disruptive behavior; training leaders in encouraging voice; and building capacity for difficult conversations.\nThe problems of giving voice are widely known across the organizational literature but are difficult to address. This case study offers an approach that includes diagnostic and intervention phases that may be helpful in remaking norms, facilitating employee voice, and improving organizational response. It highlights specific actions that are available for other organizations to adapt and test.", "We examined the association between two types of narcissism, grandiose and vulnerable, and self-reported as well as ability emotional intelligence (EI). Grandiose narcissism is characterized by high self-esteem, interpersonal dominance and a tendency to overestimate one's capabilities, whereas vulnerable narcissism presents defensive, avoidant and hypersensitive attitude in interpersonal relations. In the current study (n = 249) we found that vulnerable narcissism was significantly and negatively associated with trait (self-reported) EI; however, it did not correlate with ability (performance) EI. Grandiose narcissism was significantly positively connected with trait EI. Moreover, when the two EI scores were analyzed together in a single model, they were associated with grandiose narcissism in opposite directions. Specifically, trait EI showed a positive relation with grandiose narcissism, while ability EI negatively predicted this type of narcissism. The latter results are consistent with previous findings showing that individuals with high level of grandiose narcissism tend to overestimate their abilities. Vulnerable narcissism is probably connected with more realistic self-perception of emotional abilities.", "Psychometric intelligence is closely related to working memory capacity. Here we aim to determine the associations of neural activation patterns during the N-back working memory paradigm with psychometric intelligence and working memory performance. We solved the statistical problems of previous studies using (1) a large cohort of 1235 young adults and (2) robust voxel-by-voxel permutation-based statistics at the whole-brain level. Many of the significant correlations were weak, and our findings were not consistent with those of previous studies. We observed that many of the significant correlations involved brain areas in the periphery or boundaries between the task-positive network (TPN) and task-negative network (TNN), suggesting that the expansion of the TPN or TNN is associated with greater cognitive ability. Lower activity in TPN and less task-induced deactivation (TID) in TNN were associated with greater cognitive ability. These findings indicate that subjects with greater cognitive ability have a lower brain response to task demand, consistent with the notion that TID in TNN reflects cognitive demand but partly inconsistent with the prevailing neural efficiency theory. One exception was the pre-supplementary motor area, which plays a key role in cognitive control and sequential processing. In this area, intelligent subjects demonstrated greater activity related to working memory, suggesting that the pre-supplementary motor area plays a unique role in the execution of working memory tasks in intelligent subjects.", "WHAT IS KNOWN ON THE SUBJECT?: Client aggression in forensic psychiatry is associated with burnout symptoms in nursing staff. It is unclear what mechanisms contribute to this relationship. The type and severity of aggression might be of importance in the association between client aggression and burnout symptoms, but also the personality characteristics and emotional intelligence of nursing staff. It is unknown whether wearable devices that measure arousal can be used to detect chronic stress and burnout symptoms. WHAT DOES THIS PAPER ADD TO EXISTING KNOWLEDGE?: Especially, physical aggression as experienced by nursing staff is associated with staff's burnout symptoms (e.g., emotional exhaustion and depersonalization). Further research on the aggression questionnaire is necessary. The stress management skill of nursing staff is an important factor to consider in the association between burnout symptoms and client aggression. The wearable device was not useful for detecting burnout symptoms. WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE?: Nursing staff who experience (physical) aggression should be carefully monitored and should receive social support from their management to aid their well-being. Contrary to intuition, nurses who reported a higher number of stress management skills might have to be monitored more closely if necessary.\nIntroduction Aggressive behaviour of forensic clients is associated with burnout symptoms in nursing staff. The role of staff characteristics as moderators is unclear. Aim We explored the association between type and severity of aggressive behaviour as experienced by nursing staff and staff's burnout symptoms. In addition, the moderating roles of personality characteristics and emotional intelligence (EI) were studied. Moreover, the usefulness of ambulatory skin conductance assessments in detecting arousal related to burnout symptoms was studied. Method A total of 114 forensic nursing staff members filled out questionnaires and wore an ambulatory device. Results Experiencing physical aggression was positively associated with staff's burnout symptoms. Stress management skills, a subscale of EI, but not personality, moderated this relationship. Skin conductance was not associated with burnout symptoms. Remarkably, the association between aggression and burnout symptoms was highest for staff reporting a higher number of stress management skills. Discussion Longitudinal research is necessary to establish causality between client aggression and staff burnout symptoms. In addition, further research is necessary on the validity of the aggression measure used in the current study. Implication for practice Nursing staff who experience physical aggression frequently should receive social support for this, and staff who report high stress management skills should be monitored more carefully after having been confronted with aggression.", "We aimed to study the association of urine fluoride with intelligence quotient (IQ) in children with a careful consideration of up to 30 potential confounding factors as well as possible heterogeneity of the relation between urine fluoride levels and IQ scores across children with different dopamine receptor-2 (DRD2) Taq 1A genotypes (CC, CT, and TT).\nA school-based cross-sectional study design was applied. A total of 323 children (2014-2015, 7-12 years old) were enrolled from four schools in both historical endemic and non-endemic areas of fluorosis in Tianjin of China using a cluster sampling method. Urine fluoride levels and age-specific IQ scores in children were measured at the enrollment. Polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism methods were used to genotype DRD2 Taq 1A polymorphism with genomic DNA isolated from whole blood collected at the enrollment. Multiple linear regression models were applied to evaluate the relationship between urine fluoride levels and IQ scores overall and within the DRD2 Taq 1A SNP = CC/CT and TT subgroups. Model robustness was tested through bootstrap, sensitivity analysis, and cross-validation techniques. A safety threshold of urine fluoride levels for IQ impairment was determined in the subgroup TT.\nIn overall participants, the DRD2 Taq 1A polymorphism itself was not related to IQ scores in children who had a high level of urine fluoride. In the CC/CT subgroup, urine fluoride levels and IQ scores in children were unrelated (adjusted \u03b2 (95% confidence interval (CI)) = - 1.59 (- 4.24, 1.05), p = 0.236). Among the participants carrying the TT genotype, there was a strong and robust negative linear relationship between log-urine fluoride and IQ scores in children (adjusted \u03b2 (95% CI) = - 12.31 (- 18.69, - 5.94), p\u202f<\u202f0.001). Urine fluoride levels had a stronger association with IQ in children carrying the TT genotype (adjusted \u03b2 = - 12.31, bootstrapped standard error (SE) = 1.28), compared to that in overall participants (adjusted \u03b2 = - 2.47, bootstrapped SE = 3.75) (Z = 2.483 and bootstrapped p = 0.007). The safety threshold of urine fluoride levels in the subgroup TT was 1.73\u202fmg/L (95% CI = (1.51, 1.97) (mg/L)).\nThere is heterogeneity in the relation between urine fluoride and IQ across children carrying different DRD2 Taq 1A genotypes. Large-scale epidemiological studies are needed to confirm our findings.", "Children with medulloblastoma (MB) are predisposed for negative cognitive sequela, which has been widely identified in this population. The purpose of the present study was to explore cognitive deficits and psychopathological symptoms and analyse their relation among MB survivors. The Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children and the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI-KID) was administered to 34\u00a0MB survivors to measure cognitive functioning and psychopathological symptoms. The MB survivors had lower global IQ (86.41 [79.70-93.13]) compared with the control population mean. We found impaired functioning in all IQ subscales in the MB survivors group, of which processing speed (84.15 [77.71-90.58]) was the most affected. Higher radiation dose and high-dose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue were significantly associated factors for lowered global IQ, while age at diagnosis, sex and time period from diagnosis were not significantly associated. Compulsive disorder, generalised anxiety, separation anxiety and posttraumatic stress disorder were significantly more prevalent in the MB survivor group than a group of 46 control participants. No correlation was found between the cognitive deficits and the psychopathological symptoms. Our results identify that MB survivors suffer from cognitive and psychopathological impairments, and these could exist independently from each other.", "Maltreatment (MT) during childhood wreaks lasting havoc on the developing central nervous system and is one of the most salient risk factors for numerous psychiatric disorders, including depression.1 Early intervention and prevention strategies to improve outcomes of youth who have experienced MT are sorely needed; advancement in this area will require a deeper understanding of the neurobiological trajectory between the occurrence of MT and the later emergence of illness. One approach is to select neurobiological measures that are known to be impaired in the fully fledged disorder and use them to assess youth with a history of MT who have not yet shown impairment. In depression research, an emerging research area is to study spontaneously generated thoughts that occur while awake but at unstructured times, when thoughts tend to wander. Mind wandering has been linked with intelligence, creative thought generation, and resting-state functional connectivity within the default mode network.2 However, in depression, these wandering thoughts can get stuck on negative content3,4 and could represent a core feature of the illness. Therefore, examination of spontaneously generated thoughts, and their neural correlates, is a promising avenue for research seeking precursors of depression in youth with a history of MT.", "Clinical research has boomed over the past decade, with the development of multiple clinical datasets that are available for retrospective review. However, data remain incomplete based on fragmented reporting, provider change, and loss of follow-up. New technologies are being developed to assist with this limitation, by joining health care systems' medical records, and tracking Medicare claims files. The future of health care will rely more heavily on these systems, and artificial intelligence to quickly pull relevant clinical and genomic data regarding particular diagnoses, as a means to personalize medicine. This article reviews current advances in management of Big Data.", "We investigated the role that childhood and old age cognitive ability play in the association between functional health literacy and mortality.\nProspective cohort study.\nThis study used data from the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936 (LBC1936) study, which recruited participants living in the Lothian region of Scotland when aged 70 years, most of whom had completed an intelligence test at age 11 years.\n795 members of the LBC1936 with scores on tests of functional health literacy and cognitive ability in childhood and older adulthood.\nParticipants were followed up for 8 years to determine mortality. Time to death in days was used as the primary outcome measure.\nUsing Cox regression, higher functional health literacy was associated with lower risk of mortality adjusting for age and sex, using the Shortened Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adults (HR 0.95, 95%\u2009CI 0.92 to 0.98), the Newest Vital Sign (HR 0.88, 95%\u2009CI 0.80 to 0.97) and a functional health literacy composite measure (HR 0.77, 95%\u2009CI 0.65 to 0.92), but not the Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine (HR 0.95, 95%\u2009CI 0.90 to 1.01). Adjusting for childhood intelligence did not change these associations. When additionally adjusting for fluid-type cognitive ability in older age, associations between functional health literacy and mortality were attenuated and non-significant.\nCurrent fluid ability, but not childhood intelligence, attenuated the association between functional health literacy and mortality. Functional health literacy measures may, in part, assess fluid-type cognitive abilities, and this may account for the association between functional health literacy and mortality.", "The importance of building capacity in community interventions is well recognized. There is general agreement about the determinants of capacity and a range of existing capacity frameworks, however there is limited evidence or consistency in practice around assessing capacity in community interventions. The aim of this review was to describe how capacity is assessed in community interventions. A systematic review of the literature across four databases (MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO and Sociological Abstracts) was performed. Studies in English from 2000 to 2017, that explicitly described how capacity building processes were assessed in community interventions in healthy populations, were included. All types of empirical study designs were eligible. From 2596 records, after exclusion criteria were applied, 19 studies were included describing 12 different capacity assessment frameworks or tools. Seventeen studies assessed capacity processes by measuring individual capacity domains in community interventions. The most common capacity domains used to assess capacity were leadership, resources, partnerships and intelligence. The majority (n\u2009=\u200915) of studies used qualitative or mixed methods designs to measure capacity. Nine studies assessed capacity prospectively over time; three before/after and six multiple times during the intervention. Five studies assessed capacity retrospectively. The findings suggest that capacity assessment may need to remain context specific and flexible in order to capture the ever-changing nature of capacity building over time. Future research should explore the utility of theoretical adaptive capacity assessment guidelines that direct researchers and practitioners when describing capacity assessment in community interventions.", "Our aim was to compare the neurocognitive performance and mental health outcome of adults living with HIV on antiretroviral therapy with that of community controls, all of low literacy. Furthermore, we also wanted to explore the relationship of these outcomes with quality of life among adults living with HIV.\nThis was a descriptive cross-sectional study.\nThe study was conducted in Kilifi County, a region located at the Kenyan coast.\nThe participants consisted of a consecutive sample of 84 adults living with HIV and 83 randomly selected community controls all with \u22648 years of schooling. All participants were assessed for non-verbal intelligence, verbal working memory and executive functioning. The Major Depression Inventory and a quality of life measure (RAND SF-36) were also administered.\nUsing analysis of covariance, we found no statistically significant group differences between adults living with HIV and community controls in all the neurocognitive tests except for a marginal difference in the non-verbal intelligence test (F (1, 158)=3.83, p=0.05). However, depressive scores of adults living with HIV were significantly higher than those of controls (F (1, 158)=11.56, p<0.01). Also, quality of life scores of adults living with HIV were significantly lower than those of controls (F (1, 158)=4.62, p=0.03). For the HIV-infected group, results from multivariable linear regression analysis showed that increasing depressive scores were significantly associated with poorer quality of life (\u03b2=-1.17, 95%\u2009CI -1.55 to -0.80; p<0.01).\nOur findings suggest that adults of low-literacy levels living with HIV and on antiretroviral medication at the Kenyan coast do not have significant cognitive deficits compared with their uninfected counterparts. However, their mental health, compared with that of HIV-uninfected adults, remains poorer and their quality of life may deteriorate when HIV and depressive symptoms co-occur.", "Dyslexia is a neurodevelopmental disorder that manifests as a reading disability despite normal intelligence and adequate educational opportunity. Twin and family studies have indicated a genetic component, while genome-wide studies have implicated a number of susceptibility genes, most of which have direct or indirect roles in neuronal migration. Reelin (RELN) has important biological functions facilitating migration of neurons. Polymorphisms in RELN have been implicated in related disorders like autism and schizophrenia but have not been examined in dyslexia. We hypothesized that not only RELN, but its interactors in the neuronal migration pathway may play roles in the etiology of dyslexia. Twenty two functional variants across six RELN signalling genes (RELN, VLDLR, APOER2, DAB1, LIS1 and NDEL1) and two dyslexia candidate genes (DCDC2 and ROBO1) were analyzed for association in twenty six nuclear and three extended families with individuals affected with dyslexia. Univariate association analysis was suggestive of association (puncorrected\u2009=\u20090.01) with rs362746 in RELN which however did not withstand Bonferroni corrections (pcorrected\u2009=\u20090.21). Multimarker tests indicated significant association (p\u2009=\u20090.037), based on which we tested for haplotype associations. Although there were no significant haplotypic associations, we found that a three marker unit with rs3808039 and rs2072403 flanking and independently in linkage disequilibrium with rs362746 was significantly overtransmitted (risk allelic combination - TAT) to dyslexia affected individuals in the sample (p\u2009=\u20090.002). Our results suggest preliminary evidence for a new potential risk variant in the RELN locus for dyslexia.", "Background: Emotional intelligence refers to a process through which an individual is not only capable of understanding his/her/others' emotions, but also is able to manage them. Emotional intelligence can get disturbed due to different neurological diseases. Since cognition and emotion are directly and closely related, the present study aims to evaluate the relationship between emotional intelligence and cognitive disorders in patients with Multiple Sclerosis (MS). Methods: The demographic data of 92 MS patients participating in this study were recorded. The emotional intelligence and cognitive disorders were studied using the Bradberry-Greaves, and MS Neuropsychological Questionnaire (MSNQ) tests, respectively. Results: 16 men and 76 women were considered in this study. The mean age of the participants was 33.4 years, the mean duration of the disease was 6.8 years, the mean of Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) was 1.97, the mean MSNQ was 21.58, and the mean emotional quotient (EQ) of the patients was 74.18. The MSNQ had a significant relationship with the total EQ and its sub-categories (P < 0.05). Conclusion: This study showed that EQ and cognitive disorders are directly relevant to each other; as cognitive disorder increases, the EQ rate decreases. Therefore, cognitive rehabilitation might be effective in enhancing the EQ in these patients.", "General intelligence or g is one of the most thoroughly studied concepts in the behavioral sciences. Measures of intelligence are predictive of a wide range of educational, occupational, and life outcomes, including creative productivity and are systematically related to physical health and successful aging. The nexus of relations suggests 1 or several fundamental biological mechanisms underlie g, health, and aging, among other outcomes. Cell-damaging oxidative stress has been proposed as 1 of many potential mechanisms, but the proposal is underdeveloped and does not capture other important mitochondrial functions. I flesh out this proposal and argue that the overall efficiency of mitochondrial functioning is a core component of g; the most fundamental biological mechanism common to all brain and cognitive processes and that contributes to the relations among intelligence, health, and aging. The proposal integrates research on intelligence with models of the centrality of mitochondria to brain development and functioning, neurological diseases, and health more generally. Moreover, the combination of the maternal inheritance of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), the evolution of compensatory nuclear DNA, and the inability of evolutionary processes to purge deleterious mtDNA in males may contribute to the sex difference in variability in intelligence and in other cognitive domains. The proposal unifies many now disparate literatures and generates testable predictions for future studies.

These CFs are then input to our set of heuristic rules used to reach diagnostic findings and impressions propagated into a sR referred as an AI-driven structured report (AIsR). The diagnostic accuracy of the AIsR for detecting coronary artery disease (CAD) and ischemia was tested in 1,000 patients who had undergone rest/stress SPECT MPI.\nAt the high-specificity (SP) level, in a subset of 100 patients, there were no statistical differences in the agreements between the AIsr, and nine experts' impressions of CAD (P\u00a0=\u00a0.33) or ischemia (P\u00a0=\u00a0.37). This high-SP level also yielded the highest accuracy across global and regional results in the 1,000 patients. These accuracies were statistically significantly better than the other two levels [sensitivity (SN)/SP tradeoff, high SN] across all comparisons.\nThis AI reporting system automatically generates a structured natural language report with a diagnostic performance comparable to those of experts.", "Knowledge on the neurodevelopmental and physical function in children with vertebral defects, anorectal malformations, cardiac defects, tracheo-oesophageal fistula, renal and limb malformations (VACTERL) is scarce. We evaluated Swedish preschool children with VACTERL and identified whether they would need extra support in school.\nFrom 2015 to 2017, we recruited children aged 5-7 with VACTERL association from the paediatric surgical centre at the University Children's Hospital at Uppsala. Neurodevelopmental function was assessed by age-appropriate intelligence and visual and auditory attention tests, and the children's behaviour and attention were observed by an experienced psychologist. Physical function was evaluated through parental interviews and examinations. Data on patient characteristics, including any surgery and anaesthesia, were extracted from medical records.\nOf the 13 eligible families, 10 agreed to participate. Intelligence was within the normal range for all children, but attention difficulties were found in eight of the children, requiring adjustments at school, and two of these were later diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. All children had physical dysfunctions that affected their daily nutrition, bowel or bladder functions.\nAttention difficulties and physical dysfunction were common in Swedish preschool children aged 5-7 with VACTERL and they would need support and adjustments when they started school.", "This study examined the factorial validity of the Slovene version of the cultural intelligence scale (CQS) in a representative sample of 1,000 Slovenian participants (49% were female). The results of confirmatory factor analysis supported the factorial validity of the Slovene CQS and the existence of a general (second-order) cultural intelligence factor. The four scales and the overall (general) CQS scale showed satisfactory internal consistency. The results of multiple-group confirmatory factor analyses supported the hypotheses of partial measurement invariance across gender, and full measurement invariance across type of settlement (urban vs. rural).", "Intelligent analysis of a visual scene requires that important regions be prioritized and attentionally selected for preferential processing. What is the basis for this selection? Here we compared the influence of meaning and image salience on attentional guidance in real-world scenes during two free-viewing scene description tasks. Meaning was represented by meaning maps capturing the spatial distribution of semantic features. Image salience was represented by saliency maps capturing the spatial distribution of image features. Both types of maps were coded in a format that could be directly compared to maps of the spatial distribution of attention derived from viewers' eye fixations in the scene description tasks. The results showed that both meaning and salience predicted the spatial distribution of attention in these tasks, but that when the correlation between meaning and salience was statistically controlled, only meaning accounted for unique variance in attention. The results support theories in which cognitive relevance plays the dominant functional role in controlling human attentional guidance in scenes. The results also have practical implications for current artificial intelligence approaches to labeling real-world images.", "Prejudicial attitudes are widely seen between human groups, with significant consequences. Actions taken in light of prejudice result in discrimination, and can contribute to societal division and hostile behaviours. We define a new class of group, the prejudicial group, with membership based on a common prejudicial attitude towards the out-group. It is assumed that prejudice acts as a phenotypic tag, enabling groups to form and identify themselves on this basis. Using computational simulation, we study the evolution of prejudicial groups, where members interact through indirect reciprocity. We observe how cooperation and prejudice coevolve, with cooperation being directed in-group. We also consider the co-evolution of these variables when out-group interaction and global learning are immutable, emulating the possible pluralism of a society. Diversity through three factors is found to be influential, namely out-group interaction, out-group learning and number of sub-populations. Additionally populations with greater in-group interaction promote both cooperation and prejudice, while global rather than local learning promotes cooperation and reduces prejudice. The results also demonstrate that prejudice is not dependent on sophisticated human cognition and is easily manifested in simple agents with limited intelligence, having potential implications for future autonomous systems and human-machine interaction.", "Cancer imposes a global health burden as it represents one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality while also giving rise to significant economic burden owing to the associated expenditures for its monitoring and treatment. In spite of advancements in cancer therapy, the low success rate and recurrence of tumor has necessitated the ongoing search for new therapeutic agents. Aside from drugs based on small molecules and protein-based biopharmaceuticals, there has been an intense effort geared towards the development of peptide-based therapeutics owing to its favorable and intrinsic properties of being relatively small, highly selective, potent, safe and low in production costs. In spite of these advantages, there are several inherent weaknesses that are in need of attention in the design and development of therapeutic peptides. An abundance of data on bioactive and therapeutic peptides have been accumulated over the years and the burgeoning area of artificial intelligence has set the stage for the lucrative utilization of machine learning to make sense of these large and high-dimensional data. This review summarizes the current state-of-the-art on the application of machine learning for studying the bioactivity of anticancer peptides along with future outlook of the field. Data and R codes used in the analysis herein are available on GitHub at https://github.com/Shoombuatong2527/anticancer-peptides-review.", "Several researchers have proposed a new application for human augmentation, which is to provide human supervision to autonomous artificial intelligence (AI) systems. In this paper, we introduce a framework to implement this proposal, which consists of using Brain\u207bComputer Interfaces (BCI) to influence AI computation via some of their core algorithmic components, such as heuristic search. Our framework is based on a joint analysis of philosophical proposals characterising the behaviour of autonomous AI systems and recent research in cognitive neuroscience that support the design of appropriate BCI. Our framework is defined as a motivational approach, which, on the AI side, influences the shape of the solution produced by heuristic search using a BCI motivational signal reflecting the user's disposition towards the anticipated result. The actual mapping is based on a measure of prefrontal asymmetry, which is translated into a non-admissible variant of the heuristic function. Finally, we discuss results from a proof-of-concept experiment using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to capture prefrontal asymmetry and control the progression of AI computation of traditional heuristic search problems.", "In the future artificial intelligence (AI) will have the potential to improve outcomes diabetes care. With the creation of new sensors for physiological monitoring sensors and the introduction of smart insulin pens, novel data relationships based on personal phenotypic and genotypic information will lead to selections of tailored, effective therapies that will transform health care. However, decision-making processes based exclusively on quantitative metrics that ignore qualitative factors could create a quantitative fallacy. Difficult to quantify inputs into AI-based therapeutic decision-making processes include empathy, compassion, experience, and unconscious bias. Failure to consider these \"softer\" variables could lead to important errors. In other words, that which is not quantified about human health and behavior is still part of the calculus for determining therapeutic interventions.", "Despite the high long-term survival in localized prostate cancer, metastatic prostate cancer remains largely incurable even after intensive multimodal therapy. The lethality of advanced disease is driven by the lack of therapeutic regimens capable of generating durable responses in the setting of extreme tumor heterogeneity on the genetic and cell biological levels. Here, we review available prostate cancer model systems, the prostate cancer genome atlas, cellular and functional heterogeneity in the tumor microenvironment, tumor-intrinsic and tumor-extrinsic mechanisms underlying therapeutic resistance, and technological advances focused on disease detection and management. These advances, along with an improved understanding of the adaptive responses to conventional cancer therapies, anti-androgen therapy, and immunotherapy, are catalyzing development of more effective therapeutic strategies for advanced disease. In particular, knowledge of the heterotypic interactions between and coevolution of cancer and host cells in the tumor microenvironment has illuminated novel therapeutic combinations with a strong potential for more durable therapeutic responses and eventual cures for advanced disease. Improved disease management will also benefit from artificial intelligence-based expert decision support systems for proper standard of care, prognostic determinant biomarkers to minimize overtreatment of localized disease, and new standards of care accelerated by next-generation adaptive clinical trials.", "Intelligence generated by a surveillance system is dependent on the quality of data that are collected. We investigated the knowledge, attitudes and practices of nurses responsible for outbreak early warning surveillance data collection in Solomon Islands to identify factors that influence their ability to perform surveillance-related tasks with rigour.\nWe interviewed 12 purposively selected surveillance nurses and conducted inductive analysis on resulting data.\nInterviewees were knowledgeable and willing to contribute to the surveillance system. Constraining factors included the perception that surveillance was less important than patient care and could be 'deferred' during busy periods and wide variability in the application of case definitions. Motivating factors were frequent in-clinic training, formal recognition for good performance, incentives and designation of a focal point. Nurses held mixed views about the effect of mobile technologies on surveillance practice.\nThis study identified several challenges to consistent and accurate data collection and reporting. Engagement of different parts of the health system, including human resources and health facilities' management, is needed to address these challenges.", "The use of two cusp catastrophe models has been effective for untangling the effects of cognitive workload, fatigue, and other complications on the performance of individuals. This study is the first to use the two models to separate workload and fatigue effects on team performance. In an experiment involving an emergency response simulation, 360 undergraduates were organized into 44 teams. Workload was varied by team size, number of opponents, and time pressure. The cusp models for workload and fatigue were more accurate for describing trends in team performance criteria compared to linear alternatives. Individual differences in elasticity-rigidity were less important than subjective workload and experimental conditions as control variables. Fluid intelligence within the team was an important compensatory ability in the fatigue model. Results further supported the nonlinear paradigm for the assessment of cognitive workload and fatigue and demonstrated its effectiveness for understanding team phenomena.", "Over the last decades, the extralinguistic benefits of bilingualism have been intensively debated. The current study was aimed at clarifying whether bilingualism speeds attentional disengagement. Reflecting faster disengagement, Mishra, Hilchey, Singh, and Klein (2012) observed an earlier onset of inhibition of return (IOR) for high than for low-proficient bilinguals. In contrast, Hernandez, Costa, Fuentes, Vivas, and Sebastian-Galles (2010) failed to find any difference between bilinguals and monolinguals. We investigated the source of this discrepancy, while improving methodology by using a large sample composed of 100 Canadians, objective assessments of second language skills (Nelson-Denny Reading test), and controlling for nonverbal intelligence, age, sex, and video-gaming. Results were analyzed with self-report and objective measures of second language proficiency as well as dichotomous and continuous measures. Compared to less proficient bilinguals, highly proficient bilinguals tended to respond faster overall, hinting at an executive processing advantage. However, contrary to Mishra et al.'s findings, bilingual proficiency did not affect either the onset of IOR or magnitude of IOR. (PsycINFO Database Record", "Violent radicalization and terrorism continue to pose social and security problems. Starting from the theoretical framework offered by the significance quest theory, the purpose of this research was to analyze the different roles that radical intentions play in the relationship between the loss of significance and violent disinhibition in Muslims and non-Muslims. For this reason, we carried out two studies: the first one with 133 Muslims and 126 non-Muslims, and the second with 98 Muslims and 167 non-Muslims. Specifically, we measured how perceived oppression influenced violent disinhibition through radical intentions. Secondly, we also measured the impact of identity and cultural intelligence in these relations. The main finding of the research was that there was an indirect effect of perceived oppression on violent disinhibition through radical intentions in the Muslim sample, whereas, in the non-Muslim sample, the effect of perceived oppression on violent disinhibition was not mediated by radical intentions. These results were replicated in both studies. Additionally, we found that identity and culture were factors that moderated the proposed relations. This work therefore shows that the conjunction of the loss of significance and radical intentions seems to strongly exacerbate the likelihood of a process of violent disinhibition for those who are considered to be in marginal contexts. Overall, different pathways and intervening factors are in the process of radicalizing Muslims and non-Muslims in Western societies.", "The intermethod agreement between automated algorithms for brainstem segmentation is investigated, focusing on the potential involvement of this structure in Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). Inconsistencies highlighted in previous studies on brainstem in the population with ASD may in part be a result of poor agreement in the extraction of structural features between different methods. A sample of 76 children with ASD and 76 age-, gender-, and intelligence-matched controls was considered. Volumetric analyses were performed using common tools for brain structures segmentation, namely FSL-FIRST, FreeSurfer (FS), and Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs). For shape analysis SPHARM-MAT was employed. Intermethod agreement was quantified in terms of Pearson correlations between pairs of volumes obtained by the different methods. The degree of overlap between segmented masks was quantified in terms of the Dice index. Both Pearson correlations and Dice indices, showed poor agreement between FSL-FIRST and the other methods (ANTs and FS), which by contrast, yielded Pearson correlations greater than 0.93 and average Dice indices greater than 0.76 when compared with each other. As with volume, shape analyses exhibited discrepancies between segmentation methods, with particular differences noted between FSL-FIRST and the others (ANT and FS), with under- and over-segmentation in specific brainstem regions. These data suggest that research on brain structure alterations should cross-validate findings across multiple methods. We consistently detected an enlargement of brainstem volume in the whole sample and in the male cohort across multiple segmentation methods, a feature particularly driven by the subgroup of children with idiopathic intellectual disability associated with ASD.", "The reliable and objective assessment of intelligence and personality has been a topic of increasing interest of contemporary neuroscience and psychology. It is known that intelligence can be measured by estimating the mental speed or velocity of information processing. This is usually measured as a reaction time during elementary cognitive task processing, while personality is often assessed by means of questionnaires. On the other hand, human personality affects the way a subject accomplishes elementary cognitive tasks and, therefore, some personality features can define intelligence. It is expected that these features, as well as mental abilities in performing cognitive tasks are associated with the brain's electrical neural activity. Although several studies reported correlation between event-related potentials, mental ability and intelligence, there is a lack of information about time-frequency and spatio-temporal structures of neural activity which characterize this relation. In the present work, we analyzed human electroencephalograms (EEG) recorded during the performance of elementary cognitive tasks using the Schulte test, which is a paper-pencil based instrument for assessing elementary cognitive ability or mental speed. According to particular features found of the EEG structure, we divided the subjects into three groups. For subjects in each group, we applied the Sixteen Personality Factor Questionnaire (16PF) to assess the their personality traits. We demonstrated that each group exhibited a different score on the personality scale, such as warmth, reasoning, emotional stability and dominance. Summing up, we found a link between EEG features, mental abilities and personality traits. The obtained results can be of great interest for testing human personality to create automatized intelligent programs which combine simple tests and EEG measurements for real estimation of human personality traits and mental abilities.", "Mounting evidence of the efficacy of active learning has prompted educators to consider adoption of these practices in college-level classrooms. One tenet of active learning is that most, if not all, students have the ability to learn. Instructors' perspectives on learning, however, may or may not be aligned with this. One belief held by some educators is that intelligence is fixed, that is, some students are more intelligent and have a higher ability to learn than others. Instructors with a fixed mindset may not be convinced that their investment in developing active-learning materials will be as fruitful as the education evidence suggests, because these instructors may not believe that most students can grow in their learning. Here, we explored the relationship between fixed mindsets and the adoption of active-learning strategies. We found that instructors with higher fixed mindsets were less persuaded that active-learning strategies were a good idea and less likely to implement the teaching practices. Our research suggests that development initiatives should explicitly address educators' lay theories of intelligence ( fixed or growth mindset) to support successful implementation of active learning.", "Chest pain accounts for approximately 6% of Emergency Department (ED) attendances and is the most common reason for emergency hospital admission. For many years, our approach to diagnosis has required patients to stay in hospital for at least 6-12\u202fh to undergo serial biomarker testing. As less than one fifth of the patients undergoing investigation actually has an acute coronary syndrome (ACS), there is tremendous potential to reduce unnecessary hospital admissions. Recent advances in diagnostic technology have improved the efficiency of care pathways. Decision aids such as the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) risk score and the History, Electrocardiogram, Age, Risk factors and Troponin (HEART) score enable rapid 'rule out' of ACS within hours of patients arriving in the ED. With high sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTn) assays, approximately one third of patients can have ACS 'ruled out' with a single blood test, and up to two thirds could have an acute myocardial infarction 'ruled out' with a second sample taken after as little as 1\u202fh. Building on those recent advances, this paper presents an overview of the principles behind the development of the Troponin-only Manchester Acute Coronary Syndromes (T-MACS) decision aid. This clinical prediction model could be used to 'rule out' and 'rule in' ACS following a single blood test and to calculate the probability of ACS for every patient. The future potential of this approach is then addressed, including practical applications of artificial intelligence, shared decision making, near-patient testing and personalized medicine.", "This current review article focuses on recent contributions to on-site forensic investigations. Portable and potentially portable methods are presented and critically discussed about (bio)chemical trace analysis and studies performed outside the controlled laboratory environment to rapidly help in crime scene inquiries or forensic intelligence purposes. A wide range of approaches including electrochemical sensors, microchip electrophoresis, ambient ionization on portable mass spectrometers, handheld Raman and NIR instruments as well as and point-of-need devices, like paper-based platforms, for in-field analysis of latent evidences, controlled substances, drug screening, hazards, and others to assist in law enforcements and solving crime more efficiently are highlighted. The covered examples have successfully demonstrated the huge potential of portable devices for on-site applications. Future investigations should consider analytical validation to compete equality and even replace current gold standard methods.", "The genetic analysis of complex traits does not escape the current excitement around artificial intelligence, including a renewed interest in \"deep learning\" (DL) techniques such as Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). However, the performance of DL for genomic prediction of complex human traits has not been comprehensively tested. To provide an evaluation of MLPs and CNNs, we used data from distantly related white Caucasian individuals (n \u223c100k individuals, m \u223c500k SNPs, and k = 1000) of the interim release of the UK Biobank. We analyzed a total of five phenotypes: height, bone heel mineral density, body mass index, systolic blood pressure, and waist-hip ratio, with genomic heritabilities ranging from \u223c0.20 to 0.70. After hyperparameter optimization using a genetic algorithm, we considered several configurations, from shallow to deep learners, and compared the predictive performance of MLPs and CNNs with that of Bayesian linear regressions across sets of SNPs (from 10k to 50k) that were preselected using single-marker regression analyses. For height, a highly heritable phenotype, all methods performed similarly, although CNNs were slightly but consistently worse. For the rest of the phenotypes, the performance of some CNNs was comparable or slightly better than linear methods. Performance of MLPs was highly dependent on SNP set and phenotype. In all, over the range of traits evaluated in this study, CNN performance was competitive to linear models, but we did not find any case where DL outperformed the linear model by a sizable margin. We suggest that more research is needed to adapt CNN methodology, originally motivated by image analysis, to genetic-based problems in order for CNNs to be competitive with linear models.", "Over the past decade, evidence has emerged that children growing up after neonatal critical illness, irrespective of underlying diagnosis, are at risk of memory impairment and academic problems. These difficulties are manifest even when intelligence is within the normal range. In this Review, we propose a common neurodevelopmental pathway following neonatal critical illness by showing that survivors of preterm birth, congenital heart disease, and severe respiratory failure share an increased risk of long-term memory deficits and associated hippocampal alterations. Rather than a consequence of underlying diagnosis, we suggest that this shared vulnerability is probably related to common conditions associated with neonatal critical illness, including hypoxia, neuroinflammation, stress, exposure to anaesthetics, or a complex interplay of these factors at different postconceptional ages. Future work should be aimed at improvement of early identification of patients at risk and evaluation of intervention modalities, such as exercise or cognitive training.", "To test whether Personal Activity Intelligence (PAI), a personalized metric of physical activity (PA) tracking, is associated with all-cause and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality in patients with self-reported CVD and to determine whether these associations change depending on whether contemporary PA recommendations are met.\nA total of 3133 patients with CVD (mean [SD] age, 67.6 [10.3] years; 64% men) were followed from the date of participation in the Nord-Tr\u00f8ndelag Health Study (between January 1, 1984, and February 28, 1986) until the date of death or the end of follow-up (December 31, 2015). The participants' weekly PAI score was calculated and divided into 4 groups (PAI scores of 0, \u226450, 51-99, and \u2265100). We used Cox proportional hazards regression models to estimate hazard ratios for CVD and all-cause mortality rates.\nAfter mean follow-up of 12.5 years (39,157 person-years), there were 2936 deaths (94%), including 1936 CVD deaths. Participants with weekly PAI scores of 100 or greater had 36% (95% CI, 21%-48%) and 24% (95% CI, 10%-35%) lower risk of mortality from CVD and all causes, respectively, compared with the inactive group. Participants had similar risk reductions associated with their weekly PAI scores regardless of following contemporary PA recommendations or not.\nObtaining a weekly PAI score of at least 100 was associated with lower mortality risk from CVD and all causes in individuals with CVD regardless of whether the current PA recommendations were met.", "Over the coming century, the accelerating advance of bioenhancement technologies, robotics, and artificial intelligence (AI) may significantly broaden the qualitative range of sentient and intelligent beings. This article proposes a taxonomy of such beings, ranging from modified animals to bioenhanced humans to advanced forms of robots and AI. It divides these diverse beings into three moral and legal categories-animals, persons, and presumed persons-describing the moral attributes and legal rights of each category. In so doing, the article sets forth a framework for extending the concept of personhood well beyond its current boundaries, assigning moral standing to a variety of biological and nonbiological beings. The author concludes that six of the eight subgroups of such beings deserve to be treated as persons or as if they were persons, with full consideration for their presumed interests, rights, obligations, and capabilities for ethically significant agency and patiency.", "A fundamental challenge of biology is to understand the vast heterogeneity of cells, particularly how cellular composition, structure, and morphology are linked to cellular physiology. Unfortunately, conventional technologies are limited in uncovering these relations. We present a machine-intelligence technology based on a radically different architecture that realizes real-time image-based intelligent cell sorting at an unprecedented rate. This technology, which we refer to as intelligent image-activated cell sorting, integrates high-throughput cell microscopy, focusing, and sorting on a hybrid software-hardware data-management infrastructure, enabling real-time automated operation for data acquisition, data processing, decision-making, and actuation. We use it to demonstrate real-time sorting of microalgal and blood cells based on intracellular protein localization and cell-cell interaction from large heterogeneous populations for studying photosynthesis and atherothrombosis, respectively. The technology is highly versatile and expected to enable machine-based scientific discovery in biological, pharmaceutical, and medical sciences.", "Teaching-learning-based optimization (TLBO) algorithm is a novel heuristic method which simulates the teaching-learning phenomenon of a classroom. However, in the later period of evolution of the TLBO algorithm, the lower exploitation ability and the smaller scope of solutions led to the poor results. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel version of TLBO that is augmented with error correction strategy and Cauchy distribution (ECTLBO) in which Cauchy distribution is utilized to expand the searching space and error correction to avoid detours to achieve more accurate solutions. The experimental results verify that the ECTLBO algorithm has overall better performance than various versions of TLBO and is very competitive with respect to other nine original intelligence optimization algorithms. Finally, the ECTLBO algorithm is also applied to path planning of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), and the promising results show the applicability of the ECTLBO algorithm for problem-solving.", "This study examined associations between 3 distinct parent factors (parent personal distress, parenting stress, and spina bifida (SB)-specific parenting stress) and youth and parent proxy reports of youth health-related quality of life (HRQOL) over time.\nParticipants were recruited as part of a longitudinal study, and data were collected at 3 time points, spaced 2 years apart. Parents and youth completed questionnaires, and youth completed neuropsychological assessment tasks to determine youth intelligence quotient during home visits.\nAnalyses revealed that higher levels of maternal SB-specific parenting stress were related to lower levels of youth-reported HRQOL at time 1. Other parent factors were not associated with youth report of HRQOL at the earlier time points, although higher levels of maternal SB-specific parenting stress and paternal parenting stress were associated with lower levels of youth HRQOL at time 3. For mothers and fathers, increased parent personal distress, parenting stress, and SB-specific parenting stress were associated with decreased proxy report of youth HRQOL. Of these three parent factors, SB-specific parenting stress was consistently the most strongly associated with parent proxy-report of youth HRQOL.\nParenting stress and distress are important targets for interventions, and these interventions may improve youth outcomes, especially as youth age. Future research is needed to identify other factors influencing youth HRQOL over time.", "Many decisions of individuals involve a combination of internal preferences and mental processes related to cognitive ability. As Frederick (2005) argued in this journal, \"there is no good reason for ignoring the possibility that general intelligence or various more specific cognitive abilities are important causal determinants of decision making.\" Since then, a number of empirical studies have focused on the relationship between cognitive ability and decision-making in different contexts. This paper will focus on the relationship between cognitive ability and decision-making under risk and uncertainty. Taken as a whole, this research indicates that cognitive ability is associated with risk-taking behavior in various contexts and life domains, including incentivized choices between lotteries in controlled environments, behavior in nonexperimental settings, and self-reported tendency to take risks. We begin by clarifying some important distinctions between concepts and measurement of risk preference and cognitive ability. In particular, complexity and possible confusions arise because observed measures of risk preference and cognitive ability are used to represent the latent characteristics of these concepts. We discuss the substantial (and somewhat implausible) range of assumptions that need to be satisfied in order to be able to interpret a correlation between measures of risk preference and cognitive ability as a relationship between latent risk preference and latent cognitive ability. Drawing causal inferences from such relationships raises additional challenges. We go on to argue that it is nevertheless important and valuable to study whether cognitive ability is related to measured risk preference (see also Dohmen, Falk, Huffman, and Sunde 2010). Risk preference is typically measured by risky behavior (actual or self-reported). If risky behavior varies systematically with cognitive ability, this may reinforce or counteract the impact of cognitive ability on life outcomes, depending on the nature of the correlation. If there is a relationship, it also becomes important to control for cognitive ability when relating life outcomes to standard revealed preference measures of risk preference. If cognitive ability has a causal impact on measured risk preference, it is important to understand the mechanism, and some intriguing policy implications arise. We then take stock of what is known empirically on the connections between cognitive ability and measured risk preferences, looking at studies using real-world risky behavior, experimental measures of risky choice, and self-reported measures of willingness to take risks. One pattern that emerges frequently in these studies is that cognitive ability tends to be positively correlated with avoidance of harmful risky situations, but it tends to be negatively correlated with risk aversion in advantageous situations. This suggests that the relationship between cognitive ability and risk taking has a reinforcing effect on economic outcomes. There is also intriguing emerging evidence that measured risk preference is particularly strongly related to certain facets of cognitive ability, those that facilitate quantitative problem solving, with implications for understanding mechanisms and possibly for better targeting policy interventions. We conclude by discussing perspectives for future research, in particular the scope for the development of richer sets of elicitation instruments and measurement across a wider range of concepts. We also consider progress in neuroscience, but conclude that at present that field still seems relatively far from allowing definitive conclusions about latent risk preference and cognitive ability. Nevertheless, the existing empirical evidence suggests that interventions to influence cognitive ability, should they be possible, might have spillovers on risky choice.", "Grammar is one of the most fundamental components of language and working memory (WM) is one of the most important cognitive features. These two skills play a vital role in learning, literacy and communication. Children with cochlear implants (CIs) experience delays in both of these skills. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between these two skills in children with CIs.\nThe sample consisted of 20 Farsi-speaking children with CIs. WM was estimated by forward and backward auditory digit spans (FBS and BDS) from the Persian (Farsi) version of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, 4th edition. The comprehension of grammar by participants was evaluated using the Persian Syntax Comprehension Test. Grammar expression was assessed using the Photographic Expressive Persian Grammar Test. Pearson's correlation and simple linear regression were used for data analysis.\nThe results of linear regression and correlation showed a strong correlation between comprehension of grammar and FDS (r\u202f=\u202f0.61; p\u202f=\u202f0.004) was obtained, between BDS and comprehension of grammar (r\u202f=\u202f0.161; p\u202f=\u202f0.080). FDS and expression of grammar (r\u202f=\u202f0.163; p\u202f=\u202f0.222) showed a positive but insignificant correlation.\nThe results indicate that WM decisively effects grammar. Enhancement of the phonological loop can improve grammar, especially comprehension of grammar. The effect of the central executive in grammar requires further research.", "Alphabet Printing (in the forward and backward order) is a brief and highly portable test with promise as a screening measure of processing speed and simple working memory, constructs which are only minimally assessed in many of the most commonly-used cognitive screening instruments. The aim of this project was to examine the construct validity of timed Alphabet Printing in a sample of 254 Veterans with cognitive complaints and a history of possible head injury. Criterion measures included more established tests of processing speed and simple working memory, including the Trail Making Test and the Digit Span subtest from the fourth edition of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scales. Alphabet Printing scores moderately correlated with the criterion measures of attention, working memory, and processing speed, and demonstrated acceptable classification accuracy in discriminating between individuals with and without evidence of cognitive impairment on Trails B. These findings provide additional support for the possible utility of including Alphabet Printing during cognitive screenings or as part of a larger neuropsychological test battery.", "Decision-making is being performed frequently in areas of computation to obtain better performance in a wide variety of current intelligent activities. In practical terms, this decision-making must adapt to dynamic changes in environmental conditions. However, because of limited computational resources, adaptive decision-making is generally difficult to achieve using conventional computers. The ionic decision-maker reported here, which uses electrochemical phenomena, has excellent dynamic adaptabilities, as demonstrated by its ability to solve multiarmed bandit problems (MBPs) in which a gambler given a choice of slot machines must select the appropriate machines to play so as to maximize the total reward in a series of trials. Furthermore, our ionic decision-maker successfully solves dynamic competitive MBPs, which cause serious loss due to the collision of selfish users in communication networks. The technique used in our devices offers a shift toward decision-making using the motion of ions, an approach that could find myriad applications in computer science and technology, including artificial intelligence.", "How are the myriad stimuli arriving at our senses transformed into conscious thought? To address this question, in a series of studies, we asked whether a common mechanism underlies loss of information processing in unconscious states across different conditions, which could shed light on the brain mechanisms of conscious cognition. With a novel approach, we brought together for the first time, data from the same paradigm-a highly engaging auditory-only narrative-in three independent domains: anesthesia-induced unconsciousness, unconsciousness after brain injury, and individual differences in intellectual abilities during conscious cognition. During external stimulation in the unconscious state, the functional differentiation between the auditory and fronto-parietal systems decreased significantly relatively to the conscious state. Conversely, we found that stronger functional differentiation between these systems in response to external stimulation predicted higher intellectual abilities during conscious cognition, in particular higher verbal acuity scores in independent cognitive testing battery. These convergent findings suggest that the responsivity of sensory and higher-order brain systems to external stimulation, especially through the diversification of their functional responses is an essential feature of conscious cognition and verbal intelligence.", "Idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (iPAH) is a rare progressive, life-shortening disease, usually diagnosed at an advanced stage. We hypothesize that patients with iPAH exhibit patterns of health-seeking behavior before diagnosis that will allow the development of earlier identification tools. The Sheffield Pulmonary Hypertension IndeX (SPHInX) project aims to develop a predictive algorithm based on routinely collected healthcare resource utilization (HCRU) data. This report focuses on the initial feasibility of the project, examining whether Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data from the National Health Service in England have sufficient richness to support the development of an early diagnosis algorithm. This is a two-stage study. First, hospital interactions during 2009-2014 captured in HES data identified 127,815 adult patients with pulmonary hypertension (PH) ICD-10 codes, containing a probable iPAH cohort with incidence and demographics similar to the reported literature. HCRU was high in the three years before diagnosis. Second, to examine HCRU in patients with a confirmed iPAH diagnosis, we built the SPHInX dataset incorporating all patients investigated for suspected PH in the Sheffield Pulmonary Vascular Disease Unit during 2008-2016 (n\u2009=\u20096674). For the SPHInX dataset, data could be linked to HES in 98.6% of cases and patients with confirmed iPAH had similar levels of pre-diagnosis HCRU. In conclusion, patients with probable iPAH identified using HES and patients with confirmed iPAH have high levels of HCRU for several years before diagnosis. Artificial intelligence models will now be used to develop the SPHInX algorithm to screen for undiagnosed iPAH in the general population.", "The stressful life events experienced by adolescents with problematic behaviors, should be considered for implementing effective interventions. This study aimed to examine the adjustment of adolescents with problematic behaviors, and to assess the effectiveness of a family-based treatment, namely Scene-Based Psychodramatic Family Therapy (SB-PFT), according to different stress profiles. Ten SB-PFT sessions, over 17 trials were implemented. Stressful life events and adolescent adjustment were evaluated at pretest and posttest, for the SB-PFT participants (n = 104 adolescents) and a control group (n = 106). The adolescents were categorized into three profiles depending on the nature of the stressors: family stress profile, individual and family stress profile, and low stress profile. The individual and family stress group showed worse adjustment. Effectiveness analyses revealed improvements in SB-PFT participants' emotional intelligence, but not in anger and hostility. Furthermore, adolescents with low and family-related stress profiles showed enhancements in parent attachment. In conclusion, interventions involving adolescents with problematic behaviors must be tailored to the stressful life events experienced. Specific treatments should be used alongside SB-PFT, when adolescents are met with individual-related stress. Nevertheless, SB-PFT seemed to promote emotional intelligence and parent attachment, particularly in adolescents with problematic behaviors that experienced only family stressors.", "This study reports neuropsychological outcomes based on preoperative Wada testing in patients with drug-resistant mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (mTLE).\nPatient records were retrospectively reviewed as part of a larger database. Patients with a diagnosis of TLE based on seizure semiology and long-term surface video-electroencephalography (EEG) were identified. These patients underwent preoperative and postoperative testing including advanced imaging (magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]), Wada testing, and neuropsychological assessment. Decrements in neuropsychological function were noted in comparison of pre- and postoperative studies. Patients had regular follow-up in the multidisciplinary epilepsy clinic to assess seizure outcomes. All participants had Engel class I/II outcome following selective amygdalohippocampectomy (AH) via the inferior temporal gyrus (ITG) approach.\nForty-eight patients with electrographic and clinical semiology consistent with unilateral mTLE were identified. Left mTLE was identified in 28 patients (58.3%), whereas 20 patients (41.7%) had right mTLE. Language-dominant hemisphere resections were performed on 23 patients (47.9%) (all left-sided surgery), whereas 25 (52.1%) had language nondominant resection (all right-sided and five left-sided surgery). Twenty-two participants (45.8%) showed no Wada memory asymmetry (No-WMA), whereas 26 (54.2%) exhibited Wada memory asymmetry (WMA). Postoperatively, analysis of variance (ANOVA) found that the No-WMA group exhibited a decline in verbal memory, but average scores on measures of nonverbal reasoning, general intelligence, and mood improved. Alternatively, patients with WMA did not show declines in memory postoperatively, and also exhibited improved nonverbal reasoning and general intelligence. Neither group exhibited reliable decline in verbal fluency or visual confrontation naming.\nWada procedures for predicting surgical outcome from elective temporal surgery have been criticized and remain an area of active debate. However, decades of data across multiple epilepsy centers have demonstrated the value of Wada for reducing unanticipated neuropsychological adverse effects of surgical treatment. These data show that no Wada memory asymmetry increases the risk for neuropsychological decline following ITG approach for selective AH for drug-resistant mTLE.", "Genetic and environmental factors both contribute to cognitive test performance. A substantial increase in average intelligence test results in the second half of the previous century within one generation is unlikely to be explained by genetic changes. One possible explanation for the strong malleability of cognitive performance measure is that environmental factors modify gene expression via epigenetic mechanisms. Epigenetic factors may help to understand the recent observations of an association between dopamine-dependent encoding of reward prediction errors and cognitive capacity, which was modulated by adverse life events. The possible manifestation of malleable biomarkers contributing to variance in cognitive test performance, and thus possibly contributing to the \"missing heritability\" between estimates from twin studies and variance explained by genetic markers, is still unclear. Here we show in 1475 healthy adolescents from the IMaging and GENetics (IMAGEN) sample that general IQ (gIQ) is associated with (1) polygenic scores for intelligence, (2) epigenetic modification of DRD2 gene, (3) gray matter density in striatum, and (4) functional striatal activation elicited by temporarily surprising reward-predicting cues. Comparing the relative importance for the prediction of gIQ in an overlapping subsample, our results demonstrate neurobiological correlates of the malleability of gIQ and point to equal importance of genetic variance, epigenetic modification of DRD2 receptor gene, as well as functional striatal activation, known to influence dopamine neurotransmission. Peripheral epigenetic markers are in need of confirmation in the central nervous system and should be tested in longitudinal settings specifically assessing individual and environmental factors that modify epigenetic structure.", "We discuss a particular case of an artificially deformed skull discovered in Naples in 1892 and published in the Italian Journal of Natural Sciences by the anthropologist Abele De Blasio. To comprehend the observations of the researcher about the \"defects of intelligence\" caused by the artificial deformation of the skull, we will also analyze other articles in which De Blasio presented the deformed skulls of ancient Peruvian mummies.", "Prenatal exposure to persistent organic pollutants (POPs), such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), was found to be associated with poorer neurological development in children. Knowledge about the effects on outcomes until adolescence is limited.\nTo determine whether prenatal exposure to POPs, particularly hydroxylated PCBs (OH-PCBs), is associated with cognitive and motor development in 13- to 15-year-old children.\nThis prospective observational cohort study is part of the Development at Adolescence and Chemical Exposure (DACE)-study, a follow-up of two Dutch birth cohorts. Maternal pregnancy serum levels of PCB-153 and three OH-PCBs were measured, in part of the cohort also nine other PCBs and three OH-PCBs, and in another part five polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), dichloroethene (DDE), pentachlorophenol (PCP) and hexabroomcyclododecane (HBCDD). Of the 188 invited adolescents, 101 (53.7%) participated, 55 were boys. Cognition (intelligence, attention, verbal memory) and motor performance (fine motor, ball skills, balance) were assessed. Scores were classified into 'normal' (IQ\u202f>\u202f85; scores\u202f>\u202fP15) and '(sub)clinical' (IQ\u202f\u2264\u202f85; scores\u202f\u2264\u202fP15). We used linear and logistic regression analyses, and adjusted for maternal education, maternal smoking, maternal alcohol use, breast feeding, and age at examination.\nSeveral OH-PCBs were associated with more optimal sustained attention and balance. PCB-183 was associated with lower total intelligence (OR: 1.29; 95%CI:0.99-1.68; P\u202f=\u202f.060), and HBCDD with lower performance intelligence (OR: 3.62; 95%CI:0.97-13.49; P\u202f=\u202f.056). PCBs, OH-PCBs and PBDEs were negatively associated with verbal memory.\nPrenatal background exposure to several POPs can influence neuropsychological outcomes in 13- to 15-year-old Dutch adolescents, although exposure to most compounds does not have clinically relevant consequences at adolescence.", "The interest in Expert systems has increased in the medical area. Some of them are employed even for diagnosis. With the variability of transcatheter prostheses, the most appropriate choice can be complex. This scenario reveals an enabling environment for the use of an Expert system. The goal of the study was to develop an Expert system based on artificial intelligence for supporting the transcatheter aortic prosthesis selection.\nThe system was developed on Expert SINTA. The rules were created according to anatomical parameters indicated by the manufacturing company. Annular aortic diameter, aortic area, aortic perimeter, ascending aorta diameter and Valsalva sinus diameter were considered. After performing system accuracy tests, it was applied in a retrospective cohort of 22 patients with submitted to the CoreValve prosthesis implantation. Then, the system indications were compared to the real heart team decisions.\nFor 10 (45.4%) of the 22 patients there was no concordance between the Expert system and the heart team. In all cases with discordance, the software was right in the indication. Then, the patients were stratified in two groups (same indication vs. divergent indication). The baseline characteristics did not show any significant difference. Mortality, stroke, acute myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, atrioventricular block, aortic regurgitation and prosthesis leak did not present differences. Therefore, the maximum aortic gradient in the post-procedure period was higher in the Divergent Indication group (23.9 mmHg vs. 11.9 mmHg, P=0.03), and the mean aortic gradient showed a similar trend.\nThe utilization of the Expert system was accurate, showing good potential in the support of medical decision. Patients with divergent indication presented high post-procedure aortic gradients and, even without clinical repercussion, these parameters, when elevated, can lead to early prosthesis dysfunction and the necessity of reoperation.", "Despite the availability of free routine immunizations in low- and middle-income countries, many children are not completely vaccinated, vaccinated late for age, or drop out from the course of the immunization schedule. Without the technology to model and visualize risk of large datasets, vaccinators and policy makers are unable to identify target groups and individuals at high risk of dropping out; thus default rates remain high, preventing universal immunization coverage. Predictive analytics algorithm leverages artificial intelligence and uses statistical modeling, machine learning, and multidimensional data mining to accurately identify children who are most likely to delay or miss their follow-up immunization visits.\nThis study aimed to conduct feasibility testing and validation of a predictive analytics algorithm to identify the children who are likely to default on subsequent immunization visits for any vaccine included in the routine immunization schedule.\nThe algorithm was developed using 47,554 longitudinal immunization records, which were classified into the training and validation cohorts. Four machine learning models (random forest; recursive partitioning; support vector machines, SVMs; and C-forest) were used to generate the algorithm that predicts the likelihood of each child defaulting from the follow-up immunization visit. The following variables were used in the models as predictors of defaulting: gender of the child, language spoken at the child's house, place of residence of the child (town or city), enrollment vaccine, timeliness of vaccination, enrolling staff (vaccinator or others), date of birth (accurate or estimated), and age group of the child. The models were encapsulated in the predictive engine, which identified the most appropriate method to use in a given case. Each of the models was assessed in terms of accuracy, precision (positive predictive value), sensitivity, specificity and negative predictive value, and area under the curve (AUC).\nOut of 11,889 cases in the validation dataset, the random forest model correctly predicted 8994 cases, yielding 94.9% sensitivity and 54.9% specificity. The C-forest model, SVMs, and recursive partitioning models improved prediction by achieving 352, 376, and 389 correctly predicted cases, respectively, above the predictions made by the random forest model. All models had a C-statistic of 0.750 or above, whereas the highest statistic (AUC 0.791, 95% CI 0.784-0.798) was observed in the recursive partitioning algorithm.\nThis feasibility study demonstrates that predictive analytics can accurately identify children who are at a higher risk for defaulting on follow-up immunization visits. Correct identification of potential defaulters opens a window for evidence-based targeted interventions in resource limited settings to achieve optimal immunization coverage and timeliness.", "Importance: A mystery illness striking U.S. and Canadian diplomats to Cuba (and now China) \"has confounded the FBI, the State Department and US intelligence agencies\" (Lederman, Weissenstein, & Lee, 2017). Sonic explanations for the so-called health attacks have long dominated media reports, propelled by peculiar sounds heard and auditory symptoms experienced. Sonic mediation was justly rejected by experts. We assessed whether pulsed radiofrequency/microwave radiation (RF/MW) exposure can accommodate reported facts in diplomats, including unusual ones. Observations: (1) Noises: Many diplomats heard chirping, ringing or grinding noises at night during episodes reportedly triggering health problems. Some reported that noises were localized with laser-like precision or said the sounds seemed to follow them (within the territory in which they were perceived). Pulsed RF/MW engenders just these apparent \"sounds\" via the Frey effect. Perceived \"sounds\" differ by head dimensions and pulse characteristics and can be perceived as located behind in or above the head. Ability to hear the \"sounds\" depends on high-frequency hearing and low ambient noise. (2) Signs/symptoms: Hearing loss and tinnitus are prominent in affected diplomats and in RF/MW-affected individuals. Each of the protean symptoms that diplomats report also affect persons reporting symptoms from RF/MW: sleep problems, headaches, and cognitive problems dominate in both groups. Sensations of pressure or vibration figure in each. Both encompass vision, balance, and speech problems and nosebleeds. Brain injury and brain swelling are reported in both. (3) Mechanisms: Oxidative stress provides a documented mechanism of RF/MW injury compatible with reported signs and symptoms; sequelae of endothelial dysfunction (yielding blood flow compromise), membrane damage, blood-brain barrier disruption, mitochondrial injury, apoptosis, and autoimmune triggering afford downstream mechanisms, of varying persistence, that merit investigation. (4) Of note, microwaving of the U.S. embassy in Moscow is historically documented. Conclusions and relevance: Reported facts appear consistent with pulsed RF/MW as the source of injury in affected diplomats. Nondiplomats citing symptoms from RF/MW, often with an inciting pulsed-RF/MW exposure, report compatible health conditions. Under the RF/MW hypothesis, lessons learned for diplomats and for RF/MW-affected civilians may each aid the other.", "According to the national survey data over the past five years, there are about 50.16 million elderly diabetic patients (\u226560 years old) in China. With the increase in the total number of the elderly, this number will be expected to increase. Among the elderly patients, most of them are newly diagnosed, and are associated with a number of risk factors for cardiovascular diseases at the time of initial diagnosis. Those who were with young-onset have a long-term clinical course, and often complicated with diabetic chronic complications and potential organ dysfunctions. Most of the elderly diabetic patients in China are with poor glycemic control. The diabetes-related complications have become one of the major reasons for the senile death. It is well accepted that early diagnosis and reasonable treatment could reduce the occurrence of diabetic complications, and the disability and fatal cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events. Thus, it is recommended, in the consensus, to conduct a comprehensive assessment of the glycemic control, metabolic cardiovascular risk factors, diabetes complications, multiple organ functions of the elderly patients, as well as their intelligence and physical fitness. Personalized control targets on blood glucose, pressure, lipids, uric acid and body weight would be established based on the assessment of each patient and consideration of the balance between benefits and risks in order to achieve the goal of early detection, early diagnosis, early treatment and early target reaching. Moreover, it is also recommended, in the consensus, to focus on the basic treatments (diets, exercises, self-monitoring and management), initiate suitable hypoglycemic drugs with complementary mechanisms when needed, and take into consideration of management of multiple cardiovascular risk factors and drug usage together with the caution of mutual interactions of multiple drugs.", "The prognosis of convulsive status epilepticus (CSE), a common childhood medical neurological emergency, is not well characterised. We aimed to investigate the long-term outcomes in a cohort of participants who previously had CSE.\nIn this prospective study, we followed up a population-based childhood CSE cohort from north London, UK (the north London convulsive status epilepticus surveillance study cohort; NLSTEPSS). We collected data from structured clinical neurological assessment, neurocognitive assessment (Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence), brain MRI, medical records, and structured interviews with participants and their parents to determine neurological outcomes, with adverse outcome defined as presence of one or more of epilepsy (active or in remission), motor disability, intellectual disability, or statement of special educational needs. We applied multiple imputation to address missing data and performed binary logistic regression analyses on complete-case and imputed datasets to investigate sociodemographic and CSE factors associated with adverse outcomes.\nOf 203 survivors (90% of inception cohort), 134 (66%) were assessed at a median follow-up of 8\u00b79 years (IQR 8\u00b72-9\u00b75). The cumulative incidence of epilepsy was 24\u00b77% (95% CI 16\u00b72-35\u00b76), with most (89%) emerging within 18 months after CSE. The cumulative incidence of epilepsy was lower in patients with prolonged febrile seizures (14\u00b73%, 6\u00b73-29\u00b74) and survivors of acute symptomatic CSE (13\u00b73%, 3\u00b77-37\u00b79) than in those of remote symptomatic CSE (45\u00b75%, 21\u00b73-72\u00b70) and unclassified CSE (50\u00b70%, 25\u00b74-74\u00b76). One participant (2\u00b79%, 0\u00b75-14\u00b75) in the prolonged febrile seizures group developed temporal lobe epilepsy with mesial temporal sclerosis. The absence of fever at CSE was the only predictor of incident epilepsy (odds ratio [OR] 7\u00b75, 95% CI 2\u00b725-25\u00b71). Motor and intellectual disability was seen predominantly in participants who had idiopathic and cryptogenic CSE (seven [36\u00b78%, 95% CI 19\u00b71-59\u00b70] and 16 [84\u00b72%, 62\u00b74-94\u00b75] of 19, respectively) and remote symptomatic CSE (33 [62\u00b73%, 48\u00b78-74\u00b71] and 40 [75\u00b75%, 62\u00b74-85\u00b71] of 53), and most of these participants had pre-existing disabilities. Pre-existing epilepsy was the only predictor of intellectual disability (OR 8\u00b70, 95% CI 1\u00b71-59\u00b76). 51\u00b75% (95% CI 43\u00b71-59\u00b78) of those followed up had a statement of special educational needs.\nChildhood CSE is associated with substantial long-term neurological morbidity, but primarily in those who have epilepsy, neurological abnormalities, or both before the episode of CSE. Survivors without neurological abnormalities before CSE have favourable outcomes.\nBUPA Foundation, The Academy of Medical Sciences, Wellcome Trust, National Institute for Health Research, and Young Epilepsy.", "Our objective was to investigate various psychological and socio-demographic factors in childhood and adulthood that relate to alcohol intake and binge drinking at age 42 years. Data were drawn from the 1970 British Cohort Study (BCS70), a prospective longitudinal study monitoring the development of babies born in 1970, with nine follow-ups. The analytic sample comprised 5190 cohort members with complete data on parental social class at birth, cognitive ability at age 10 years, locus of control at age 16 years, psychological distress at age 30 years, educational qualifications obtained at age 34 years, and current occupation and alcohol consumption at age 42 years. Results showed that sex (male), lower parental social class, adolescent external locus of control, psychological distress, lower scores on childhood intelligence, lower educational qualifications, and less-professional occupations were all significantly and positively associated with binge drinking in adulthood. Hierarchical logistic regression analyses showed that sex (OR\u00a0=\u00a00.52, CI: 0.44-0.60, p\u00a0<\u00a0.001), parental social class (OR\u00a0=\u00a00.67, CI: 0.50-0.92 to OR\u00a0=\u00a00.49, CI: 0.31-0.57, p\u00a0<\u00a0.05 to p\u00a0<\u00a0.01), locus of control beliefs (OR\u00a0=\u00a00.90, CI: 0.84-0.96, p\u00a0<\u00a0.01), adult psychological distress (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.28, CI: 1.04-1.58, p\u00a0<\u00a0.05), educational qualifications (OR\u00a0=\u00a00.70, CI: 0.53-0.92 to OR\u00a0=\u00a00.39, CI: 0.25-0.61, p\u00a0<\u00a0.05 to p\u00a0<\u00a0.001), and occupational prestige (OR\u00a0=\u00a00.59, CI: 0.38-0.95 to OR\u00a0=\u00a00.36, CI: 0.20-0.65, p\u00a0<\u00a0.05 to p\u00a0<\u00a0.01) were all significant and independent predictors of adult binge drinking. Both psychological and socio-demographic factors associated with adult excessive alcohol consumption. Adolescent locus of control beliefs had a significant effect on adult binge drinking 26 years later.", "Primary Care Doctors (PCDs) are the first contact for majority of patients with psychiatric disorders across the world including India. They often provide symptomatic treatment which is naturally inadequate. Absence or inadequate exposure to psychiatric training during undergraduate medical education is one of the prime reasons. Classroom training (CRT), a standard practice to train PCDs is driven by specialist based psychiatric curriculum and inherently lacks clinical translational value.\nThe 'Department of Psychiatry' of 'National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences', Bengaluru, India has recently come up with an innovative digitally driven modules of 'Primary Care Psychiatry Program' (PCPP) for practicing PCDs. Goal of this paper is to provide an overview of all these (five) modules with its various stages of implementation.\nAuthors briefly discuss the current status of primary care psychiatry in India and also narrate the newly designed five modules of PCPP in this paper.\nAn adopted psychiatric curriculum is designed in 'Clinical Schedules for Primary Care Psychiatry' (CSP) which is an integral part of PCPP. This is brief clinical schedules contains culturally appropriate screening questionnaire, transdiagnostic classification of 8 core psychiatric disorders, diagnostic, referral and management guidelines. PCPP contains 5 modules named as orientation module, basic module, advanced module [Tele-psychiatric 'On-Consultation Training' (Tele-OCT)], videoconference based continuing skill development module, and collaborative video consultation modules which covers all essential areas of primary care psychiatry for practicing PCDs. Last three modules are fully designed digital modules in hub and spoke model of Tele Medicine. In this designed program, the CSP and Tele-OCT are two path braking innovations having inbuilt higher clinical translation value. The challenges and opportunities that could be faced during its implementation across India are also discussed.\nInnovative PCPP is pragmatic in nature and has potential for higher clinical translational value. Once validated thoroughly, PCPP has potential for pan-India expansion. There is a need for artificial intelligence-based modules for next phase of PCPP in India considering her population and lesser number of available psychiatrists.", "Pompe disease (PD) is a rare condition caused by mutations in gene encoding for the enzyme alpha-glucosidase, resulting in an abnormal intracellular accumulation of glycogen. The disease clinical spectrum ranges from severe infantile forms to adult-onset forms with minor limitations. Since 2000 enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) is available and disease natural history has changed, with prolonged survival and evidence of myopathic features.\nIn this study, we monitored disease progression up to three years in eight young patients with PD. Based on the literature data and the long term personal experience, we selected validated functional scales for neuromuscular disorders and compared the results to identify a simple and reliable protocol for the follow-up of children with PD. Moreover, we evaluated cognitive functions using developmental/cognitive tests.\nBased on study results, we suggest that motor functions in children with PD could be better assessed by Chop Intend, MFM20 (Motor Function Measure Scale for Neuromuscular Diseases 20) and NSAA (North Star Ambulatory Assessment), according to age and functional level. Evaluation should be completed with ROM (Range Of Motion) measurement, MRC (Medical Research Council) evaluation and 6MWT (6 Minute Walk test) when possible.\nThe proposed protocol seems to be reliable and should be done every six months, because of the progressive natural history of the disease, the rapid changes typical of developmental age and the need to document ERT effects.

In the case of climate change, some people have been found to systematically misinterpret climate data in ways that conflict with the intended message of climate scientists. While prior studies have attempted to reduce motivated reasoning through bipartisan communication networks, these networks have also been found to exacerbate bias. Popular theories hold that bipartisan networks amplify bias by exposing people to opposing beliefs. These theories are in tension with collective intelligence research, which shows that exchanging beliefs in social networks can facilitate social learning, thereby improving individual and group judgments. However, prior experiments in collective intelligence have relied almost exclusively on neutral questions that do not engage motivated reasoning. Using Amazon's Mechanical Turk, we conducted an online experiment to test how bipartisan social networks can influence subjects' interpretation of climate communications from NASA. Here, we show that exposure to opposing beliefs in structured bipartisan social networks substantially improved the accuracy of judgments among both conservatives and liberals, eliminating belief polarization. However, we also find that social learning can be reduced, and belief polarization maintained, as a result of partisan priming. We find that increasing the salience of partisanship during communication, both through exposure to the logos of political parties and through exposure to the political identities of network peers, can significantly reduce social learning.", "Background: Critical thinking skills are one of the most important competencies in successful clinical performance of nursing students. Emotional intelligence is also one of the concepts related to critical thinking and can play an important role in the ability to think. Thus, this study was conducted to investigate the relationship between emotional intelligence and critical thinking in nursing students. Methods: This was a quantitative, descriptive-correlative Study. Participants were nursing students in different levels. To collect data, California Critical Thinking Test (form B) and Bar-On Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire were used. Then, data were analyzed with descriptive and inferential statistics using SPSS 16 software. Results: Pearson correlation test showed no significant correlation between the total score of critical thinking skills and each of its components with the total score of emotional intelligence and its component, except for empathy (p=0.001), in nursing students. Conclusion: The findings revealed a significant relationship between empathy and critical thinking skills in nursing students. Using these elements as teaching techniques for nursing education courses can be very helpful in developing good nurse-patient relationships and improving patient care.", "Although harness racing is of high economic importance to the global equine industry, significant genomic resources have yet to be applied to mapping harness racing success. To identify genomic regions associated with harness racing success, the current study performs genome-wide association analyses with three racing performance traits in the Norwegian-Swedish Coldblooded Trotter using the 670\u00a0K Axiom Equine Genotyping Array.\nFollowing quality control, 613 horses and 359,635 SNPs were retained for further analysis. After strict Bonferroni correction, nine genome-wide significant SNPs were identified for career earnings. No genome-wide significant SNPs were identified for number of gallops or best km time. However, four suggestive genome-wide significant SNPs were identified for number of gallops, while 19 were identified for best km time. Multiple genes related to intelligence, energy metabolism, and immune function were identified as potential candidate genes for harness racing success.\nApart from the physiological requirements needed for a harness racing horse to be successful, the results of the current study also advocate learning ability and memory as important elements for harness racing success. Further exploration into the mental capacity required for a horse to achieve racing success is likely warranted.", "In almost no other field of computer science, the idea of using bio-inspired search paradigms has been so useful as in solving multiobjective optimization problems. The idea of using a population of search agents that collectively approximate the Pareto front resonates well with processes in natural evolution, immune systems, and swarm intelligence. Methods such as NSGA-II, SPEA2, SMS-EMOA, MOPSO, and MOEA/D became standard solvers when it comes to solving multiobjective optimization problems. This tutorial will review some of the most important fundamentals in multiobjective optimization and then introduce representative algorithms, illustrate their working principles, and discuss their application scope. In addition, the tutorial will discuss statistical performance assessment. Finally, it highlights recent important trends and closely related research fields. The tutorial is intended for readers, who want to acquire basic knowledge on the mathematical foundations of multiobjective optimization and state-of-the-art methods in evolutionary multiobjective optimization. The aim is to provide a starting point for researching in this active area, and it should also help the advanced reader to identify open research topics.", "Interactions between proteins and small molecules are critical for biological functions. These interactions often occur in small cavities within protein structures, known as ligand-binding pockets. Understanding the physicochemical qualities of binding pockets is essential to improve not only our basic knowledge of biological systems, but also drug development procedures. In order to quantify similarities among pockets in terms of their geometries and chemical properties, either bound ligands can be compared to one another or binding sites can be matched directly. Both perspectives routinely take advantage of computational methods including various techniques to represent and compare small molecules as well as local protein structures. In this review, we survey 12 tools widely used to match pockets. These methods are divided into five categories based on the algorithm implemented to construct binding-site alignments. In addition to the comprehensive analysis of their algorithms, test sets and the performance of each method are described. We also discuss general pharmacological applications of computational pocket matching in drug repurposing, polypharmacology and side effects. Reflecting on the importance of these techniques in drug discovery, in the end, we elaborate on the development of more accurate meta-predictors, the incorporation of protein flexibility and the integration of powerful artificial intelligence technologies such as deep learning.", "IBM Watson for Oncology (WFO), which can use natural language processing to evaluate data in structured and unstructured formats, has begun to be used in China. It provides physicians with evidence-based treatment options and ranks them in three categories for treatment decision support. This study was designed to examine the concordance between the treatment recommendation proposed by WFO and actual clinical decisions by oncologists in our cancer center, which would reflect the differences of cancer treatment between China and the U.S.\nRetrospective data from 362 patients with cancer were ingested into WFO from April 2017 to October 2017. WFO recommendations were provided in three categories: recommended, for consideration, and not recommended. Concordance was analyzed by comparing the treatment decisions proposed by WFO with those of the multidisciplinary tumor board. Concordance was achieved when the oncologists' treatment decisions were in the recommended or for consideration categories in WFO.\nOvarian cancer showed the highest concordance, which was 96%. Lung cancer and breast cancer obtained a concordance of slightly above 80%. The concordance of rectal cancer was 74%, whereas colon cancer and cervical cancer showed the same concordance of 64%. In particular, the concordance of gastric cancer was very low, only 12%, and 88% of cases were under physicians choice.\nDifferent cancer types showed different concordances, and only gastric cancers were significantly less likely to be concordant. Incidence and pharmaceuticals may be the major cause of discordance. To be comprehensively and rapidly applied in China, WFO needs to accelerate localization.

The dolphins' performance may be particularly good when the cylinders are thinner. The dolphins' performance is also asymmetric, in that the discrimination accuracy is not equal when the target thickness increases and decreases by the same amount. Inspired by this, a finite element model is proposed here to mimic a dolphin actively transmitting sound to discriminate between targets using acoustic echoes. The waveforms and frequency spectra of acoustic echoes from a standard cylinder and comparison cylinders with wall thickness differences of \u00b10.3\u2009mm were compared. The employed model simulations show good agreement with previous experimental measurements by Au and Pawloski [(1992). J. Compar. Physiol. A 170(1), 41-47]. Asymmetric arrival time shifts were found for the echo peaks and troughs with the same sequence numbers when the wall thicknesses were increased and decreased by the same amount. This asymmetry became more significant for echo peaks and troughs with higher sequence numbers. Apart from these asymmetric arrival time shifts of the acoustic echoes, the patterns of echo waveforms, the spatial distributions of sound pressures in the water, and the particle vibratory displacements in the cylinders were also found to vary with cylinder thickness. The physical origin of this asymmetric discrimination by the dolphins was explored using both geometric acoustics and wave acoustics. The asymmetry observed might be caused by the circumferential surface (Lamb) wave in the cylinder wall, which is a wave acoustics phenomenon that cannot be derived from geometric acoustics. The findings in this paper might be valuable not just for understanding the mechanism of the effect described, but also for helping the development of biomimetic intelligence for robust signal processing in underwater target discrimination.", "Naming assessment is a core component of neuropsychological evaluation, particularly in the surgical work up for patients with pharmacologically refractory epilepsy. Specifically, naming deficits are typically associated with left, but not right hemisphere epilepsy, thereby assisting with lateralization of seizure onset. We sought to determine whether bilingual (English as second language, ESL) and monolingual epilepsy patients with comparable education, intelligence, and objective vocabulary performance would perform similarly on standard naming measures, and whether ESL patients would demonstrate laterality effects in naming, similar to that observed in monolingual patients.\nParticipants were 242 adults with epilepsy (186 native, 56 ESL) who underwent neuropsychological evaluation and obtained normal range or higher scores on the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (R/III/IV) Vocabulary subtest (scaled score\u22658). Groups were compared on demographic factors and language performances (i.e., Boston Naming Test, Auditory & Visual Naming Test, word reading, fluency).\nGroups did not differ with respect to age, education, FSIQ, vocabulary, reading, or verbal fluency. However, ESL speakers earned poorer scores than native English speakers on all naming measures. Moreover, among ESL participants with unilateral epilepsy, a significant proportion of right hemisphere patients scored below cutoff for impairment. This contrasted with the more typical finding among native English speakers, whereby a significant proportion of left patients demonstrated naming impairment.\nThese results underscore the complexity of verbal assessment in bilinguals, suggesting that naming performances by ESL individuals, even those considered proficient, with strong performances on other English verbal measures, cannot be interpreted by the same standards applied for native speakers. (JINS, 2018, 24, 1057-1063).", "Emotions affect our mental health: they influence our perception, alter our physical strength, and interfere with our reason. Emotions modulate our face, voice, and movements. When emotions are expressed through the voice or face, they are difficult to measure because cameras and microphones are not often used in real life in the same laboratory conditions where emotion detection algorithms perform well. With the increasing use of smartphones, the fact that we touch our phones, on average, thousands of times a day, and that emotions modulate our movements, we have an opportunity to explore emotional patterns in passive expressive touches and detect emotions, enabling us to empower smartphone apps with emotional intelligence.\nIn this study, we asked 2 questions. (1) As emotions modulate our finger movements, will humans be able to recognize emotions by only looking at passive expressive touches? (2) Can we teach machines how to accurately recognize emotions from passive expressive touches?\nWe were interested in 8 emotions: anger, awe, desire, fear, hate, grief, laughter, love (and no emotion). We conducted 2 experiments with 2 groups of participants: good imagers and emotionally aware participants formed group A, with the remainder forming group B. In the first experiment, we video recorded, for a few seconds, the expressive touches of group A, and we asked group B to guess the emotion of every expressive touch. In the second experiment, we trained group A to express every emotion on a force-sensitive smartphone. We then collected hundreds of thousands of their touches, and applied feature selection and machine learning techniques to detect emotions from the coordinates of participant' finger touches, amount of force, and skin area, all as functions of time.\nWe recruited 117 volunteers: 15 were good imagers and emotionally aware (group A); the other 102 participants formed group B. In the first experiment, group B was able to successfully recognize all emotions (and no emotion) with a high 83.8% (769/918) accuracy: 49.0% (50/102) of them were 100% (450/450) correct and 25.5% (26/102) were 77.8% (182/234) correct. In the second experiment, we achieved a high 91.11% (2110/2316) classification accuracy in detecting all emotions (and no emotion) from 9 spatiotemporal features of group A touches.\nEmotions modulate our touches on force-sensitive screens, and humans have a natural ability to recognize other people's emotions by watching prerecorded videos of their expressive touches. Machines can learn the same emotion recognition ability and do better than humans if they are allowed to continue learning on new data. It is possible to enable force-sensitive screens to recognize users' emotions and share this emotional insight with users, increasing users' emotional awareness and allowing researchers to design better technologies for well-being.", "The current study explored the moderating role of cognitive reserve on the relationship between disability and depression in a sample of individuals in which brain pathology is thought to contribute to depression (multiple sclerosis; MS).\nFifty-four individuals with MS were examined. Depression was measured using the Beck Depression Inventory-Fast Screen (BDI-FS). In addition to collecting demographic (education) and disease burden (Expanded Disability Status Scale; EDSS) related variables, participants completed a neuropsychological test battery and psychosocial questionnaires. Cognitive reserve (CR) was conceptualized in two ways: Fixed CR and Malleable CR. Fixed CR was measured using years of education and crystallized intelligence (Shipley Vocabulary). Malleable CR was operationalized as a composite of measures from the Cognitive Heath Questionnaire (CHQ). Two regressions on depression (BDI-FS) examining either type of cognitive reserve, EDSS, and their interactions were explored. Results: The interaction between EDSS and both conceptualizations of cognitive reserve were significant, t(50) = -2.60, p = .013, PRE = .12 (Fixed CR); t(47) = -2.02, p = .049, PRE = .08 (Malleable CR). Simple effects testing revealed the same pattern regardless of the type of cognitive reserve examined; EDSS predicted depression only in those with low cognitive reserve.\nCognitive reserve moderates the relationship between disability and depression in MS; disability does not appear to influence depression in those with high cognitive reserve.", "This article was migrated. The article was marked as recommended. Introduction: There is both patient and provider dissatisfaction with the climate of healthcare delivery. Upon review, this is found to be at least in part attributable to the mechanization of health care, which often involves more computer interaction than hands-on care. Despite rising costs, the physical exam is replaced by lab tests and radiologic studies, generating more cost. The time-honored respect for a carefully obtained history from the patient is replaced by a computer check-box template. The humanity of both physician and patient are marginalized, with increased potential for both diagnostic and therapeutic compromise. Though access to medical information about disease is possible with bioinformatics, artificial intelligence cannot substitute for analysis by an informed, attentive, and properly educated physician. The process of healing must begin with the first patient visit - and the presence of an informed, compassionate, and fully attentive physician. Objective: To describe the history of medical educators' grappling with this problem through 3 landmark articles over a 100-year period. To illustrate the challenges of the climate of medical education. To offer some educational strategies (with examples of successful programs) to teach physicians using the Humanities. To illustrate that the art and science of medicine are synergistic, not dichotomous. Methods: Two educational theories ripe for use: Chickering and the Discovery Model, and Osler's recommended bedside reading list, exemplary programs that are being used currently (and over the last 25-plus years) to emphasize the importance of both the science and the practice of medicine in an effort to optimize the medical climate. Conclusion: The problem of physician burnout and patient dissatisfaction is being addressed in the medical literature, by regulatory societies devoted to physician wellness and by medical educators. This is nevertheless a challenge given the current electronic climate (with bioinformatics and artificial intelligence) and revenue-focused agendas of practice management business people. Results: With an awareness of the need for emphasis on the humanities coupled with an historical perspective over the last 100 years, a spirit of hope can be provided to both physician and patient from the lineage of the medical profession, which also is a legacy for our medical students.", "Schizophrenia presents with a broad range of negative, positive, and cognitive symptoms, and comprehensive treatment is still a challenge. Sodium nitroprusside (SNP) has been reported to rapidly reduce psychotic symptoms and improve cognitive functions in patients with schizophrenia, providing a new possible direction for treatment. In this study, we tested whether SNP can improve psychotic symptoms and cognitive function in schizophrenia patients with longer disease history. This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted between May 2016 and April 2017. Forty-two schizophrenia patients aged 18-45 years were recruited from Henan Province Mental Hospital. Baseline psychiatric symptoms were measured using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), and baseline cognitive functions were measured using the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale. Patients received two SNP or placebo infusions (0.5 \u03bcg/kg per min for 4\u202fh) at a one-week interval. We reassessed psychiatric symptoms and cognitive functions using the same tests shortly after the first and second infusions and 4 weeks after the second infusion. We did not find any significant effect of SNP over placebo on psychotic symptoms or cognitive functions, although SNP was relatively well tolerated with a good safety profile.", "The purpose of this study was to assess the level of mental disorders and challenging behaviour in individuals with intellectual disability (ID) supported by specialized services, but without a prior psychiatric diagnosis, and to compare the levels of different disorders depending on the severity of ID.\nThis is a cross-sectional study (N = 142) of population with ID. Inclusion criteria were the following: adult patients with ID and with no previous psychiatric diagnosis prior to this survey. The Wechsler Adults Intelligence Scale-II, the Psychiatric Assessment Schedule for Adults with Developmental Disability checklist and clinical interview, the Diagnostic Assessment for the Severely Handicapped scale and the Inventory for Client and Agency Planning were the assessment tools.\nA previously undiagnosed mental disorder was found in 29.6% of the sample. The most prevalent mental disorders were major depressive and anxiety disorders. An association between psychiatric comorbidity and challenging behaviour was found only for mild/moderate ID, especially for affective disorders.\nThe presence of a psychiatric as well as a medical comorbidity is associated with severe ID, unlike challenging behaviour. Clinical limitations of the study have been discussed.", "Large aneurysms seen in renal angiomyolipoma are usually more common in patients with tuberous sclerosis in comparison with sporadic cases and they are more prone to hemorrhage ranging from renal hematoma to life-threatening perirenal hemorrhages. We present a case of 13-year female patient who was referred to Civil Hospital, Karachi, with bilateral flank pain, cutaneous nodule and low intelligence. Her color doppler ultrasound revealed pseudoaneurysm in left kidney on the background of bilateral renal angiomyolipomas. Contrast enhanced CT scan confirmed various radiological manifestations of tuberous sclerosis including subependymal tubers, bilateral angiomyolipomas, and pseudoaneurysm associated with perinephric hemorrhage in left kidney.", "Emotional intelligence can help managers to effectively deal with conflicts in the workplace. However, the correlation between conflict management styles and emotional intelligence has not been fully conceptualized.\nTo examine the impact of demographic variables and emotional intelligence on conflict management styles among nurse managers from Jordan.\nA descriptive correlational design was used. A sample of 248 nurse managers completed the study.\nThe integrating style was the most commonly used style among Jordanian nursing managers, while the least frequently used style was the dominating style. Conflict management styles significantly differed according to hospital type and years of experience. There were significant relationships between emotional intelligence and conflict management styles, but the direction of this relationship is not fully consistent with previous literature.\nEducating nursing managers about emotional intelligence may improve their abilities to manage conflicts in the workplace. However, cultural factors might have a role in determining the conflict management style used by managers.\nAn analysis of the relationship between emotional intelligence and conflict management styles can assist management in initiating a tailor-training program to improve abilities to manage conflict.", "In recent years, the detrimental effects of high iodine on intelligence are gaining tons of attention, but the relationship between high iodine and neurotoxicity is controversial. This study aimed to explore whether high iodine intake may impair intelligence and the roles of apoptosis and autophagy in high iodine-induced neurotoxicity. The results showed that high iodine exposure reduced brain coefficient and intelligence of rats, and caused histopathological abnormalities in hippocampus. Moreover, high iodine increased hippocampal apoptosis, as confirmed by elevation of apoptotic proteins and TUNEL-positive incidence. Further study showed that high iodine impaired mitochondrial ultrastructure and caused elevation of Bax, cytochrome c and decline of Bcl2, indicating the participation of mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. Simultaneously, high iodine also increased the number of autophagosomes. Intriguingly, the expression of autophagosomes formation protein Atg7, Beclin1 and autophagic substrate p62 were elevated, suggesting that the accumulated autophagosomes is not only due to the enhancement of formation but also the decline of clearance. These, together with the numerous damaged organelles observed in hippocampal ultrastructure, reveal the crucial role of disordered autophagy flux in high iodine-elicited neurotoxicity. Collectively, these findings suggest that excessive apoptosis and disordered autophagy flux contribute to high iodine-elicited neurotoxicity.", "An important construct to consider within diabetes management and the changing landscape of diabetes therapies is self-efficacy. Self-efficacy research holds the potential to inform and assist the diabetes team as well as patients with type 1 diabetes.\nIn this descriptive-correlation study, 200 adolescents with type 1 diabetes were enrolled. To measure spiritual intelligence, the 24-question Spiritual Intelligence Self-Report Inventory questionnaire and to measure self-efficacy of diabetes, the Self-efficacy Questionnaire (8 questions) were used. Data collection was conducted by simple sampling. Data were analyzed using Pearson analysis, mean, and standard deviation analysis tests.\nNearly 66% of the participants were female, the mean age of the samples was 17.10 \u00b1 1.85 years, the mean duration of diabetes was 5.98 \u00b1 3.79 years, and 62.5% had a history of diabetes in first-degree relatives. Almost 42% of the participants were the first children of the family and 29.5% were studying at the university. The mean score of spiritual intelligence was 60.42 \u00b1 12.9. The mean self-efficacy score was 5.41 \u00b1 1.87. The mean scores in the critical thinking, personal meaning production, transcendental awareness, conscious state expansion were 18.31 \u00b1 4.33, 13.17 \u00b1 3.36, 11.26 \u00b1 3.36, 46.14 \u00b1 1.04, 11.33 \u00b1 1.04, and 11.89 \u00b1 3.9, respectively. Cronbach's alpha level on the level of spiritual intelligence and self-efficacy was 0.903 and 0.082, respectively, at 95% confidence level. There was a significant relationship between spiritual intelligence and self-efficacy (P = 0.026). There was no significant relationship between self-efficacy with spiritual intelligence subscales.\nThis study showed that spiritual intelligence correlates with self-efficacy and has a decisive role in improving the health of adolescents with diabetes.", "Digital pathology is the science of performing traditional pathological assessment in a digital environment. A digital transition is long overdue since histochemical analysis such as hematoxylin and eosin staining has remained unchanged in over 100 years. Importantly, the digitization of whole slide images further lends itself to advances in computational pathology and artificial intelligence to transform qualitative assessment into quantitative assessment. The impact of this transition from a computational infrastructure perspective is reminiscent of a similar transition in the field of genomics. In this article, I describe some of the similarities between genomics and digital pathology as well as highlight some key lessons learned to prevent the same mistakes and delays that slowed the genomics revolution.", "Diagnostic errors are the most common, costly and dangerous of medical mistakes. In part 1 of this series, we described how general and dermatology-specific cognitive and perceptual biases underlie most of our correct diagnoses, as well as being a source of diagnostic medical errors. In this second part of the series, we describe some tactics to combat diagnostic error. Metacognition, or thinking about how we think, is the central approach advocated to avoid errors of 'uncritical' diagnostic thinking. Current individual and medical cultural attitudes need to be modified in order to incorporate improvements in diagnosis. Algorithms, artificial intelligence and system changes are being developed to address error and improve diagnostic accuracy.", "With the rise of increasingly complex artificial intelligence (AI), there is a need to design new methods to monitor AI in a transparent, human-aware manner. Decades of research have demonstrated that people, who are not aware of the exact performance levels of automated algorithms, often experience a mismatch in expectations. Consequently, they will often provide either too little or too much trust in an algorithm. Detecting such a mismatch in expectations, or trust calibration, remains a fundamental challenge in research investigating the use of automation. Due to the context-dependent nature of trust, universal measures of trust have not been established. Trust is a difficult construct to investigate because even the act of reflecting on how much a person trusts a certain agent can change the perception of that agent. We hypothesized that electroencephalograms (EEGs) would be able to provide such a universal index of trust without the need of self-report. In this work, EEGs were recorded for 21 participants (mean age = 22.1; 13 females) while they observed a series of algorithms perform a modified version of a flanker task. Each algorithm's degree of credibility and reliability were manipulated. We hypothesized that neural markers of action monitoring, such as the observational error-related negativity (oERN) and observational error positivity (oPe), are potential candidates for monitoring computer algorithm performance. Our findings demonstrate that (1) it is possible to reliably elicit both the oERN and oPe while participants monitored these computer algorithms, (2) the oPe, as opposed to the oERN, significantly distinguished between high and low reliability algorithms, and (3) the oPe significantly correlated with subjective measures of trust. This work provides the first evidence for the utility of neural correlates of error monitoring for examining trust in computer algorithms.", "Purpose In low- to middle-income countries (LMICs), most breast cancers present as palpable lumps; however, most palpable lumps are benign. We have developed artificial intelligence-based computer-assisted diagnosis (CADx) for an existing low-cost portable ultrasound system to triage which lumps need further evaluation and which are clearly benign. This pilot study was conducted to demonstrate that this approach can be successfully used by minimally trained health care workers in an LMIC country. Patients and Methods We recruited and trained three nonradiologist health care workers to participate in an institutional review board-approved, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act-compliant pilot study in Jalisco, Mexico, to determine whether they could use portable ultrasound (GE Vscan Dual Probe) to acquire images of palpable breast lumps of adequate quality for accurate computer analysis. Images from 32 women with 32 breast masses were then analyzed with a triage-CADx system, generating an output of benign or suspicious (biopsy recommended). Triage-CADx outputs were compared with radiologist readings. Results The nonradiologists were able to acquire adequate images. Triage by the CADx software was as accurate as assessment by specialist radiologists, with two (100%) of two cancers considered suspicious and 30 (100%) of 30 benign lesions classified as benign. Conclusion A portable ultrasound system with CADx software can be successfully used by first-level health care workers to triage palpable breast lumps. These results open up the possibility of implementing practical, cost-effective triage of palpable breast lumps, ensuring that scarce resources can be dedicated to suspicious lesions requiring further workup.", "To examine the relationship between carotid atherosclerosis and cerebral cortical thickness and investigate whether cortical thickness mediates the association between carotid atheroma and relative cognitive decline.\nWe assessed 554 community-dwelling subjects (male/female: 296/258) from the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936 who underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging and carotid Doppler ultrasound studies at age 73 years. The relationship between carotid atherosclerosis markers (internal carotid artery stenosis, intima-media thickness, velocity, pulsatility, and resistivity indexes) and vertex-wide cerebral cortical thickness was examined cross-sectionally, controlling for gender, extensive vascular risk factors (VRFs), and intelligence quotient at age 11 (IQ-11). We also determined the association between carotid stenosis and a composite measure of fluid intelligence at age 73 years. A mediation model was applied to examine whether cortical thickness mediated the relationship between carotid stenosis and cognitive function.\nA widespread negative association was identified between carotid stenosis (median\u2009=\u200915%) and cerebral cortical thickness at age 73 years, independent of the side of carotid stenosis, other carotid measures, VRFs, and IQ-11. This association increased in an almost dose-response relationship from mild to severe degrees of carotid stenosis, across the anterior and posterior circulation territories. A negative association was also noted between carotid stenosis and fluid intelligence (standardized beta coefficient\u2009=\u2009-0.151, p\u2009=\u20090.001), which appeared partly (approximately 22%) mediated by carotid stenosis-related thinning of the cerebral cortex.\nThe findings suggest that carotid stenosis represents a marker of processes that accelerate aging of the cerebral cortex and cognition that is in part independent of measurable VRFs. Cortical thinning within the anterior and posterior circulation territories partially mediated the relationship between carotid atheroma and fluid intelligence. Ann Neurol 2018;84:576-587.", "Personalized, precision, P4, or stratified medicine is understood as a medical approach in which patients are stratified based on their disease subtype, risk, prognosis, or treatment response using specialized diagnostic tests. The key idea is to base medical decisions on individual patient characteristics, including molecular and behavioral biomarkers, rather than on population averages. Personalized medicine is deeply connected to and dependent on data science, specifically machine learning (often named Artificial Intelligence in the mainstream media). While during recent years there has been a lot of enthusiasm about the potential of 'big data' and machine learning-based solutions, there exist only few examples that impact current clinical practice. The lack of impact on clinical practice can largely be attributed to insufficient performance of predictive models, difficulties to interpret complex model predictions, and lack of validation via prospective clinical trials that demonstrate a clear benefit compared to the standard of care. In this paper, we review the potential of state-of-the-art data science approaches for personalized medicine, discuss open challenges, and highlight directions that may help to overcome them in the future.\nThere is a need for an interdisciplinary effort, including data scientists, physicians, patient advocates, regulatory agencies, and health insurance organizations. Partially unrealistic expectations and concerns about data science-based solutions need to be better managed. In parallel, computational methods must advance more to provide direct benefit to clinical practice.", "Sleep spindle activity in infants supports their formation of generalized memories during sleep, indicating that specific sleep processes affect the consolidation of memories early in life. Characteristics of sleep spindles depend on the infant's developmental state and are known to be associated with trait-like factors such as intelligence. It is, however, largely unknown which state-like factors affect sleep spindles in infancy. By varying infants' wake experience in a within-subject design, here we provide evidence for a learning- and memory-dependent modulation of infant spindle activity. In a lexical-semantic learning session before a nap, 14- to 16-month-old infants were exposed to unknown words as labels for exemplars of unknown object categories. In a memory test on the next day, generalization to novel category exemplars was tested. In a nonlearning control session preceding a nap on another day, the same infants heard known words as labels for exemplars of already known categories. Central-parietal fast sleep spindles increased after the encoding of unknown object-word pairings compared to known pairings, evidencing that an infant's spindle activity varies depending on its prior knowledge for newly encoded information. Correlations suggest that enhanced spindle activity was particularly triggered, when similar unknown pairings were not generalized immediately during encoding. The spindle increase triggered by previously not generalized object-word pairings, moreover, boosted the formation of generalized memories for these pairings. Overall, the results provide first evidence for a fine-tuned regulation of infant sleep quality according to current consolidation requirements, which improves the infant long-term memory for new experiences.", "This study aimed to compare the participant's perceptions about their peers' dento-facial condition with different incisal appearances (intact, discoloured, fractured, and avulsed incisors).\nA cross-sectional study was conducted among schoolchildren of both primary (8-11 years) and secondary (12-14 years) levels. Each participant was asked to judge photographs with one intact and three digitally modified central incisors giving the appearance of a traumatised tooth. Data on perceptions were collected for each condition using 12 attributes (8 positive and 4 negative; scored on a 4 point Likert scale). The positive, negative and total attribute scores were analysed separately by unpaired Student's t-test. Repeated Measures ANOVA and Bonferroni post hoc analysis was also used.\nA group of 587 children participated in the study. The perception for intact and traumatised incisors about demographic factors is well appreciated. Among the gender delineation, girls showed a significant difference in judgment between discoloured and fractured incisors. In comparison to intact incisors, positive and total attributable scores were found to be significantly higher (P < 0.001), whereas negative attribute scores were significantly lower (P < 0.001) for traumatised incisors. Pairwise comparison showed high significance (p <0.001) between the intact and traumatised incisor conditions.\nThe results demonstrated that visible dental trauma influenced the psychosocial judgment given by children towards their peers. This judgment would, in turn, affect their level of acceptance towards such appearances. Therefore, these conditions ought to be redressed as swiftly as possible.CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The primary purpose of this study was to highlight the psychosocial perceptions of children in judging their peers, regarding not only attractiveness but also intelligence, friendliness, confidence, outgoing nature, etc.", "Cognitive style is thought to be a stable marker of one's way to approach mental operations. While of wide interest over the last decades, its operationalization remains a challenge. The literature indicates that cognitive styles assessed via i) questionnaires are predicted by personality and ii) performance tests (e.g., Group Embedded Figures Test; GEFT) are related to general intelligence. In the first study, we tested the psychometric relationship between the Cognitive Style Index questionnaire (CSI) and personality inventories (NEO Five Factor Inventory; NEO-FFI, HEXACO Personality Inventory Revised; HEXACO-PI-R). In the second study, we assessed the CSI, NEO-FFI, GEFT and a general intelligence test (Raven's Standard Progressive Matrices Test; RSMT). We found that CSI scores were largely predicted by personality and that CSI was uncorrelated with GEFT performance. Instead, better performance on the GEFT was associated with better performance on the RSMT. We conclude that i) cognitive style questionnaires overlap with personality inventories, ii) cognitive style performance tests do not measure cognitive styles and should not be used as such and iii) the cognitive style concept needs to be assessed with alternative measurement types. We discuss possible future directions.", "Other people's words can have a powerful influence on how we interpret our environment, what we expect and experience, what we value, how we feel, what we choose, and how we behave. Placebo (and nocebo) effects are a dramatic example of this. The way in which healthcare professionals discuss, describe, and inform patients about the characteristic effects of a given disease and it prevention, diagnosis and treatment influence patients' feelings and expectations which in turn affects their psychobiological responses to, and subjective experiences and outcomes of the disease and its treatment effects. The effect of clinicians' words on patients' responses to treatments and procedures, both active and inert or sham is nothing less than incredible. The way in which information about treatment effects is delivered to patients can even reverse the clinically proven effects of an active treatment, or increase the adverse effects of it. In this chapter, we begin by presenting the data on the impact of message framing on affect and expectations of health care in experimental situations followed by the evidence that indicates how various patient, disease and clinician related factors modify framing effects in the clinic. Finally we discuss how framing effects affect clinical practice. They can be leveraged to enhance placebo effects and minimize nocebo effects. They can provide strategies to assist shared-decision making in the face of complex uncertainty. Going forward, automation of health care and artificial intelligence may change the delivery of health care but patients will continue to be humans seeking health gains while avoiding health losses and how the information is presented will always be susceptible to framing effects.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a major frontier in computer science research. Although AI has broad application across many medical fields, it will have particular utility in ophthalmology and will dramatically change the diagnostic and treatment pathways for many eye conditions such as corneal ectasias, glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy. However, given that AI has primarily been driven as a computer science, its concepts and terminology are unfamiliar to many medical professionals. Important key terms such as machine learning and deep learning are often misunderstood and incorrectly used interchangeably. This article presents an overview of AI and new developments relevant to ophthalmology.", "Technology driven interventions provide us with an increasing amount of fine-grained data about the patient. This data includes regular ecological momentary assessments (EMA) but also response times to EMA questions by a user. When observing this data, we see a huge variation between the patterns exhibited by different patients. Some are more stable while others vary a lot over time. This poses a challenging problem for the domain of artificial intelligence and makes on wondering whether it is possible to predict the future mental state of a patient using the data that is available. In the end, these predictions could potentially contribute to interventions that tailor the feedback to the user on a daily basis, for example by warning a user that a fall-back might be expected during the next days, or by applying a strategy to prevent the fall-back from occurring in the first place. In this work, we focus on short term mood prediction by considering the adherence and usage data as an additional predictor. We apply recurrent neural networks to handle the temporal aspects best and try to explore whether individual, group level, or one single predictive model provides the highest predictive performance (measured using the root mean squared error (RMSE)). We use data collected from patients from five countries who used the ICT4Depression/MoodBuster platform in the context of the EU E-COMPARED project. In total, we used the data from 143 patients (with between 9 and 425\u00a0days of EMA data) who were diagnosed with a major depressive disorder according to DSM-IV. Results show that we can make predictions of short term mood change quite accurate (ranging between 0.065 and 0.11). The past EMA mood ratings proved to be the most influential while adherence and usage data did not improve prediction accuracy. In general, group level predictions proved to be the most promising, however differences were not significant. Short term mood prediction remains a difficult task, but from this research we can conclude that sophisticated machine learning algorithms/setups can result in accurate performance. For future work, we want to use more data from the mobile phone to improve predictive performance of short term mood.", "Hierarchical predictive processing (PP) has recently emerged as a candidate theoretical paradigm for neurobehavioral research. To date, PP has found support through its success in offering compelling explanations for a number of perceptual, cognitive, and psychiatric phenomena, as well as from accumulating neurophysiological evidence. However, its implications for understanding intelligence and its neural basis have received relatively little attention. The present review outlines the key tenets and evidence for PP, and assesses its implications for intelligence research. It is argued that PP suggests indeterminacy as a unifying principle from which to investigate the cognitive hierarchy and brain-ability correlations. The resulting framework not only accommodates prominent psychometric models of intelligence, but also incorporates key findings from neuroanatomical and functional activation research, and motivates new predictions via the mechanisms of prediction-error minimization. Because PP also suggests unique neural signatures of experience-dependent activity, it may also help clarify environmental contributions to intellectual development. It is concluded that PP represents a plausible, integrative framework that could enhance progress in the neuroscience of intelligence.", "The brain has been described as very resistant to change. However, why it does this has not been fully explained. In this paper, I propose that resilience to the disruption of consolidated memory is at the heart of the brain's resistance to change, and this resilience is a consequence of its energy efficiency evolutionary adaptations. I discussed the implications of this energy efficiency adaptation on dogmatism, close-mindedness, and artificial intelligence.", "(1) To develop the norm of Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST), (2) to investigate the pathway of the indices for WCST performances and (3) the association between WCST, intelligence quotient (IQ), and parent-report measures of children's development in typically developing five-year-olds in the community.\nFifty-three children were recruited from community health centers. The WCST, Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence-Revised (WPPSI-R), and Taiwan Birth Cohort Study- Developmental Instrument (TBCS-DI) was used to measure children's executive function, IQ and parent report of children's development respectively.\nMean categories achieved (CA) was 2.02 (standard deviation [SD] = 1.41), and percent conceptual level response (PCLR) was 29.85(SD = 18.36) in five year-olds. The WCST indices showed a pathway relationship of PCLR being negatively associated with perseverative error (PE), and PE and non- perseverative error being negatively associated with CA. Association among the PCLR index of the WCST, cognitive domain of the TBCS-DI, and performance IQ and verbal IQ of the WPPSI-R was found.\nRegular improvement with age was found compared to the norm of six-year-olds in a previous study of children from the same region. The number sorting criteria was more difficult thus they continued to perform persistent errors of color or form when sorting. Association was found among the professional administered IQ, computerized WCST, and a parent report developmental instrument. Showing parent report is an accurate reflection of children's cognitive development at this age.", "Humans seamlessly infer the expanse of personality traits from others' facial appearance. These facial impressions are highly intercorrelated within a structure known as \"face trait space.\" Research has extensively documented the facial features that underlie face impressions, thus outlining a bottom-up fixed architecture of face impressions, which cannot account for important ways impressions vary across perceivers. Classic theory in impression formation emphasized that perceivers use their lay conceptual beliefs about how personality traits correlate to form initial trait impressions, for instance, where trustworthiness of a target may inform impressions of their intelligence to the extent one believes the two traits are related. This considered, we explore the possibility that this lay \"conceptual trait space\"-how perceivers believe personality traits correlate in others-plays a role in face impressions, tethering face impressions to one another, thus shaping face trait space. In study 1, we found that conceptual and face trait space explain considerable variance in each other. In study 2, we found that participants with stronger conceptual associations between two traits judged those traits more similarly in faces. Importantly, using a face image classification task, we found in study 3 that participants with stronger conceptual associations between two traits used more similar facial features to make those two face trait impressions. Together, these findings suggest lay beliefs of how personality traits correlate may underlie trait impressions, and thus face trait space. This implies face impressions are not only derived bottom up from facial features, but also shaped by our conceptual beliefs.", "Children born small for gestational age (SGA) with a poor adult height (AH) expectation benefit from treatment with GH and additional gonadotropin-releasing hormone analog (GnRHa). Because both SGA birth and GnRHa treatment might negatively influence cognition, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and psychosocial functioning, we assessed these outcomes at AH.\nA randomized, dose-response GH study until AH involving 99 adolescents born SGA, of whom 61 children received 2 additional years of GnRHa treatment. At AH, the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale and TNO-AZL Adults Quality of Life questionnaire were administered to the study group. Additionally, the study group and 67 adolescents born SGA (19 GnRHa) from a second study group completed the Self-Perception Profile of Adolescents and Child/Adolescent Behavior Checklist at AH. Scores in GH-treated young adults with GnRHa treatment (GH/GnRHa group) were compared with GH-treated adolescents without GnRHa treatment (GH group) and a reference population.\nMean age (SD) at AH was 17.5 (1.2) and 17.4 (1.4) years in the GH/GnRHa and GH group, respectively. Intelligence quotient scores were similar in GH/GnRHa and GH groups (96.33 vs 92.47). HRQoL was similar between both groups and also when compared with the reference population, but the GH/GnRHa group had a significantly lower perception of cognitive functioning. Self-perception and problem behavior were similar in the GH/GnRHa and GH groups. AH did not correlate with HRQoL, self-perception, or problem behavior.\nCombined GH/GnRHa treatment has no long-term negative effects on cognition, HRQoL, self-perception, and behavior in early adulthood, compared with GH treatment only.", "Behavioral weight loss (WL) trials show that, on average, participants regain lost weight unless provided long-term, intensive-and thus costly-intervention. Optimization solutions have shown mixed success. The artificial intelligence principle of \"reinforcement learning\" (RL) offers a new and more sophisticated form of optimization in which the intensity of each individual's intervention is continuously adjusted depending on patterns of response. In this pilot, we evaluated the feasibility and acceptability of a RL-based WL intervention, and whether optimization would achieve equivalent benefit at a reduced cost compared to a non-optimized intensive intervention. Participants (n\u2009=\u200952) completed a 1-month, group-based in-person behavioral WL intervention and then (in Phase II) were randomly assigned to receive 3\u00a0months of twice-weekly remote interventions that were non-optimized (NO; 10-min phone calls) or optimized (a combination of phone calls, text exchanges, and automated messages selected by an algorithm). The Individually-Optimized (IO) and Group-Optimized (GO) algorithms selected interventions based on past performance of each intervention for each participant, and for each group member that fit into a fixed amount of time (e.g., 1\u00a0h), respectively. Results indicated that the system was feasible to deploy and acceptable to participants and coaches. As hypothesized, we were able to achieve equivalent Phase II weight losses (NO\u2009=\u20094.42%, IO\u2009=\u20094.56%, GO\u2009=\u20094.39%) at roughly one-third the cost (1.73 and 1.77 coaching hours/participant for IO and GO, versus 4.38 for NO), indicating strong promise for a RL system approach to weight loss and maintenance.", "A substantial proportion of young adults with childhood-onset epilepsy may require ongoing long-term epilepsy care as adults.\nThe objective of the study was to assess the extent to which epilepsy transition discussions occurred in adolescents with childhood-onset epilepsy prior to the age of attaining majority (prior to their 18th birthday) in a community-based cohort of individuals with childhood-onset epilepsy followed longitudinally.\nThe Connecticut Study of Epilepsy is a prospective, community-based study of newly diagnosed childhood-onset epilepsy with 613 children (onset\u202f<\u202f16\u202fyears old; year recruited: 1993-97). During the final exit interview, 308 young adults \u226518\u202fyears old (or parent-proxies) were asked, \"Before you turned 18 years old, did your doctors or other epilepsy care providers talk with you about how your epilepsy care needs might change as you get older?\" ('transition discussion'). We examined whether or not sociodemographic and clinical characteristics were associated with epilepsy transition discussions.\nFor young adults with childhood-onset epilepsy (N\u202f=\u202f308; mean age: 24\u202fyears, SD\u202f=\u202f4.0; mean age of epilepsy onset: 5.4\u202fyears, SD\u202f=\u202f3.7), only 15% responded \"Yes\" to having had a \"transition discussion\". Of those with \"active epilepsy\" (N\u202f=\u202f130; seizure-free\u202f<\u202f5\u202fyears or on an antiseizure medication within 2\u202fyears of their 18th birthday) upon attaining the age of majority (18\u202fyears), 40/130 (~31%) young adults had \"transition\" discussions, compared with 7/178 (4%) of those with \"inactive epilepsy\" (p\u202f<\u202f0.0001). Self- (N\u202f=\u202f95 active epilepsy) and proxy-reports (N\u202f=\u202f35 active epilepsy) of \"transition\" discussions were comparable (31%). Having a transition discussion was associated with neurodevelopmental comorbidity and type of epilepsy care provider at time of last contact (p\u202f<\u202f0.05). Having a \"transition\" discussion was not associated with gender, race/ethnicity, high school graduation, parent insurance, epilepsy syndrome, psychiatric disorder, or intellectual disability (intelligence quotient [IQ]\u202f<\u202f70) for those with \"active epilepsy\". In assessing transfer of care, we found that only 50% of cases (who had active epilepsy at transition) were being seen by an adult or general neurologist at the time of the exit interview.\nOnly one-third of young adults with active epilepsy at transition in this community-based study reported having epilepsy care transition discussions with healthcare providers before the age of 18\u202fyears. Identifying barriers to successful delivery of effective epilepsy transition care is critical to remediating treatment care gaps and building effective future care models.", "Nanomaterials have the potential to improve how patients are clinically treated and diagnosed. While there are a number of nanomaterials that can be used toward improved drug delivery and imaging, how these nanomaterials confer an advantage over other nanomaterials, as well as current clinical approaches is often application or disease specific. How the unique properties of carbon nanomaterials, such as nanodiamonds, carbon nanotubes, carbon nanofibers, graphene, and graphene oxides, make them promising nanomaterials for a wide range of clinical applications are discussed herein, including treating chemoresistant cancer, enhancing magnetic resonance imaging, and improving tissue regeneration and stem cell banking, among others. Additionally, the strategies for further improving drug delivery and imaging by carbon nanomaterials are reviewed, such as inducing endothelial leakiness as well as applying artificial intelligence toward designing optimal nanoparticle-based drug combination delivery. While the clinical application of carbon nanomaterials is still an emerging field of research, there is substantial preclinical evidence of the translational potential of carbon nanomaterials. Early clinically trial studies are highlighted, further supporting the use of carbon nanomaterials in clinical applications for both drug delivery and imaging.", "To use Twitter to characterize public perspectives regarding artificial intelligence (AI) and radiology.\nTwitter was searched for all tweets containing the terms \"artificial intelligence\" and \"radiology\" from November 2016 to October 2017. Users posting the tweets, tweet content, and linked websites were categorized.\nSix hundred and five tweets were identified. These were from 407 unique users (most commonly industry-related individuals [22.6%]; radiologists only 9.3%) and linked to 216 unique websites. 42.5% of users were from the United States. The tweets mentioned machine/deep learning in 17.2%, industry in 14.0%, a medical society/conference in 13.4%, and a university in 9.8%. 6.3% mentioned a specific clinical application, most commonly oncology and lung/tuberculosis. 24.6% of tweets had a favorable stance regarding the impact of AI on radiology, 75.4% neutral, and none were unfavorable. 88.0% of linked websites leaned toward AI being positive for the field of radiology; none leaned toward AI being negative for the field. 51.9% of linked websites specifically mentioned improved efficiency for radiology with AI. 35.2% of websites described challenges for implementing AI in radiology. Of the 47.2% of websites that mentioned the issue of AI replacing radiologists, 77.5% leaned against AI replacing radiologists, 13.7% had a neutral view, and 8.8% leaned toward AI replacing radiologists.\nThese observations provide an overview of the social media discussions regarding AI in radiology. While noting challenges, the discussions were overwhelmingly positive toward the transformative impact of AI on radiology and leaned against AI replacing radiologists. Greater radiologist engagement in this online social media dialog is encouraged.", "Testimony from the intelligence community in the United States connecting genome editing with national security threats was a noted departure from past assessments of the implications of modern enabling biotechnologies. Rarely are individual biotechnologies included on lists of potential security threats. When they are, a broad range of advances are usually considered collectively - in terms of both risks and benefits. Given the classified nature of the rationale as to why gene editing tools were singled out, we are unlikely to fully understand for several decades what prompted this statement. This paper considers three ways in which these tools might impact national security: i) enabling the development of advanced biological weapons; ii) facilitating the development of new bioweapons based on ecological applications of genome editing, and iii) enhancing future generations of people in ways which could have an indirect impact on security, for example by improving a nation's cognitive ability and/or the physical endurance of its soldiers. Their implications are different and so are the possible policy and regulatory responses.\nUne r\u00e9cente d\u00e9claration de la communaut\u00e9 du renseignement des \u00c9tats-Unis d\u2019Am\u00e9rique, associant l\u2019\u00e9dition du g\u00e9nome \u00e0 des menaces \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 nationale, a marqu\u00e9 une prise de distance par rapport aux \u00e9valuations ant\u00e9rieures concernant les effets des biotechnologies modernes d\u2019appui.

Discussion about EI whether based on measures or theory has given little distinction as to behavioral EI (i.e., how does EI appear in a person's actions). This results in spurious conflicts about the validity of the different theories or measures which likely limit predicting managerial and leadership effectiveness, engagement, innovation and organizational citizenship. By adding a behavioral level, the concept of EI could relate to work and life outcomes beyond general mental ability and personality traits, avoid some of the criticisms while providing a more holistic theory of EI. As such, EI exists within personality as a performance trait or ability, and a self-schema self-image and trait, and a set of behaviors (i.e., competencies). The main contribution of this establishing the behavioral EI with a multi-level theory, while explaining how to assess it, the benefits of such a concept and its psychometric validity and challenges. The history and assortment of validation studies will illustrate that measures can rigorously and effectively assess the behavioral level of EI.", "Obesity has become an increasingly widespread endemic with social implications; however, the relationship between higher body mass index (BMI) and psychological functioning is still not fully understood. This study examined the differences in affect-related psychological variables among BMI classes. A total of 134 adults seeking treatment for obesity and 124 controls completed a set of questionnaires to assess: trait emotional intelligence, emotion regulation strategies, anxiety, depression, binge eating behaviors and happiness. Correlations and multivariate analysis of variance were run per each study variable controlling for BMI class (normal weight, overweight, or obesity class I, II, III). Individuals with obesity class III were characterized by reduced trait emotional intelligence and happiness, and a higher tendency to use emotion suppression compared to normal weight individuals. All individuals with obesity also showed higher levels of depression and binge eating behaviors compared to both normal weight and overweight adults. Depression and emotion suppression were the most relevant discriminant factors across BMI classes, while trait emotional intelligence resulted as an important psychological factor clustering individual differences between obese and non-obese individuals. These results suggest that more attention to the affective domain of psychological functioning is needed for proper and comprehensive treatment of obesity.", "Stretchable and conformable synapse memristors that can emulate the behaviour of the biological neural system and well adhere onto the curved surfaces simultaneously are desirable for the development of imperceptible wearable and implantable neuromorphic computing systems. Previous synapse memristors have been mainly limited to rigid substrates. Herein, a stretchable and conformable memristor with fundamental synaptic functions including potentiation/depression characteristics, long/short-term plasticity (STP and LTP), \"learning-forgetting-relearning\" behaviour, and spike-rate-dependent and spike-amplitude-dependent plasticity is demonstrated based on highly elastic Ag nanoparticle-doped thermoplastic polyurethanes (TPU\u2009:\u2009Ag NPs) and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). The memristor can be well operated even at 60% strain and can be well conformed onto the curved surfaces. The formed conductive filament (CF) obtained from the movement of Ag nanoparticle clusters under the locally enhanced electric field gives rise to resistance switching of our memristor. These results indicate a feasible strategy to realize stretchable and conformable synaptic devices for the development of new-generation artificial intelligence computers.", "To introduce and summarize current research in the field of Public Health and Epidemiology Informatics.\nThe 2017 literature concerning public health and epidemiology informatics was searched in PubMed and Web of Science, and the returned references were reviewed by the two section editors to select 14 candidate best papers. These papers were then peer-reviewed by external reviewers to provide the editorial team with an enlightened vision to select the best papers.\nAmong the 843 references retrieved from PubMed and Web of Science, two were finally selected as best papers. The first one analyzes the relationship between the disease, social/mass media, and public emotions to understand public overreaction (leading to a noticeable reduction of social and economic activities) in the context of a nation-wide outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in Korea in 2015. The second paper concerns a new methodology to de-identify patient notes in electronic health records based on artificial neural networks that outperformed existing methods.\nSurveillance is still a productive topic in public health informatics but other very important topics in Public Health are appearing. For example, the use of artificial intelligence approaches is increasing.", "To learn how cognition is implemented in the brain, we must build computational models that can perform cognitive tasks, and test such models with brain and behavioral experiments. Cognitive science has developed computational models that decompose cognition into functional components. Computational neuroscience has modeled how interacting neurons can implement elementary components of cognition. It is time to assemble the pieces of the puzzle of brain computation and to better integrate these separate disciplines. Modern technologies enable us to measure and manipulate brain activity in unprecedentedly rich ways in animals and humans. However, experiments will yield theoretical insight only when employed to test brain-computational models. Here we review recent work in the intersection of cognitive science, computational neuroscience and artificial intelligence. Computational models that mimic brain information processing during perceptual, cognitive and control tasks are beginning to be developed and tested with brain and behavioral data.", "Burnout in nursing staff is a major cause for turnover and absenteeism. Identifying risk and protective factors may be helpful in decreasing burnout symptoms. Moreover, research indicates that ambulatory assessments of the autonomic nervous system might be helpful in detecting long-term stress and burnout symptoms. One hundred and ten forensic nursing staff members completed questionnaires measuring experiences with aggressive behaviour, emotional intelligence, personality, and job stress during four waves of data collection across a 2-year period. Multilevel analyses were used to test the predicted associations and moderation effects with (the development of) burnout symptoms. Burnout was predicted by a combination of emotional intelligence, job stress, aggression, personality factors, and skin conductance, but no moderation effects over time were found. Over a period of 2\u00a0years, the model approximately predicts a change in one burnout category on the Maslach Burnout Inventory. The amount of burnout symptoms in nurses might be used as an indicator to predict turnover and absenteeism considering the increase in symptoms over time. Nursing staff who experience severe aggression and who have relatively low levels of emotional intelligence and altruism and high levels of neuroticism and job stress should be monitored and supported to decrease the risk of burnout. Staff members can be trained to increase their emotional intelligence and relieve stress to decrease their burnout symptoms and turnover and absenteeism on the long term. Ambulatory assessment might be helpful as a nonintrusive way to detect increasing levels of burnout.", "Human behavior is one of the most challenging aspects in the understanding of building physics. The need to evaluate it requires controlled environments and facilities in which researchers can test their methods. In this paper, we present the commissioning of the Controlled and Automatized Testing Facility for Human Behavior (CASITA). This is a controlled space emulation of an office or flat, with more than 20 environmental sensors, 5 electrical meters, and 10 actuators. Our contribution shown in this paper is the development of an infrastructure-Artificial Intelligence (AI) model pair that is perfectly integrated for the study of a variety of human energy use aspects. This facility will help to perform studies about human behavior in a controlled space. To verify this, we have tested this emulation for 60 days, in which equipment was turned on and off, the settings of the conditioning system were modified remotely, and lighting operation was similar to that in real behaviors. This period of commissioning generated 74.4 GB of raw data including high-frequency measurements. This work has shown that CASITA performs beyond expectations and that sensors and actuators could enable research on a variety of disciplines related to building physics and human behavior. Also, we have tested the PROPHET software, which was previously used in other disciplines and found that it could be an excellent complement to CASITA for experiments that require the prediction of several pertinent variables in a given study. Our contribution has also been to proof that this package is an ideal \"soft\" addition to the infrastructure. A case study forecasting energy consumption has been performed, concluding that the facility and the software PROPHET have a great potential for research and an outstanding accuracy.", "To study characteristics of sleep structure based on polysomnography (PSG) data of intellectually gifted schoolchildren.\nForty-four 8-9 grade schoolchildren of the boarding school were examined. In the first stage, the level of intellectual development was assessed with Raven's Progressive Matrices. An analysis of medical history and clinical examination were performed as well. Based on the result of testing, the adolescents were divided into medium intelligence group (n=15) and high intelligence group (n=29). The second stage included PSG examination.\nThere was a trend towards an increase in sleep latency with a significant decrease of deep sleep, a significant decrease in REM-sleep latency and an increase in the number of REM-sleep episodes in the high intelligence group. No significant differences in waking after sleep onset, number of arousals (EEG activations) and respiratory events, and oxygen saturation levels were identified. The characteristics of PSG in intellectually gifted schoolchildren should be considered as a compensatory and adaptive reaction in response to constant increased intellectual loads and stressful situations as risk factors for psychosomatic disorders.\n\u0426\u0435\u043b\u044c \u0438\u0441\u0441\u043b\u0435\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f. \u0418\u0437\u0443\u0447\u0438\u0442\u044c \u043e\u0441\u043e\u0431\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u0441\u0442\u0440\u0443\u043a\u0442\u0443\u0440\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u043e\u0440\u0433\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0437\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0438 \u043d\u043e\u0447\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0441\u043d\u0430 \u043f\u043e \u0434\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044b\u043c \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0441\u043e\u043c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0444\u0438\u0438 (\u041f\u0421\u0413) \u0443 \u0432\u044b\u0441\u043e\u043a\u043e\u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u043b\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0442\u0443\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0448\u043a\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0432. \u041c\u0430\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0430\u043b \u0438 \u043c\u0435\u0442\u043e\u0434\u044b. \u041e\u0431\u0441\u043b\u0435\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u044b 44 \u0443\u0447\u0430\u0449\u0438\u0445\u0441\u044f 8-\u0433\u043e \u0438 9-\u0433\u043e \u043a\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0441\u043e\u0432 \u043b\u0438\u0446\u0435\u044f-\u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u043d\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0432 \u0432\u043e\u0437\u0440\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0435 14-15 \u043b\u0435\u0442. \u041d\u0430 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0432\u043e\u043c \u044d\u0442\u0430\u043f\u0435 \u0432\u0441\u0435\u043c \u0448\u043a\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0430\u043c \u043e\u0441\u0443\u0449\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043b\u044f\u043b\u043e\u0441\u044c \u0442\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0441 \u0438\u0441\u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435\u043c \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0432\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u043c\u0430\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0446 \u0420\u0430\u0432\u0435\u043d\u0430, \u043f\u043e\u0437\u0432\u043e\u043b\u044f\u044e\u0449\u0435\u0435 \u043e\u0446\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0443\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043d\u044c \u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u043b\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0442\u0443\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0438\u044f, \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043b\u0441\u044f \u0430\u043d\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0437 \u043c\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0446\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0434\u043e\u043a\u0443\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0438 \u0438 \u043e\u0431\u0449\u0438\u0439 \u043a\u043b\u0438\u043d\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043e\u0441\u043c\u043e\u0442\u0440. \u041f\u043e \u0440\u0435\u0437\u0443\u043b\u044c\u0442\u0430\u0442\u0430\u043c \u0442\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0431\u044b\u043b\u0438 \u0441\u0444\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u044b \u0434\u0432\u0435 \u0433\u0440\u0443\u043f\u043f\u044b: \u0432 \u043e\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043d\u0443\u044e \u0433\u0440\u0443\u043f\u043f\u0443 \u0432\u043e\u0448\u043b\u0438 29 \u0448\u043a\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0432 \u0441 \u0432\u044b\u0441\u043e\u043a\u0438\u043c \u0443\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043d\u0435\u043c \u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u043b\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0442\u0430, \u0432 \u043a\u043e\u043d\u0442\u0440\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0443\u044e -

The interplay of these elements leads to the emergence of biological intelligence. Inspired by such intricate natural phenomena, Evolved Plastic Artificial Neural Networks (EPANNs) employ simulated evolution in-silico to breed plastic neural networks with the aim to autonomously design and create learning systems. EPANN experiments evolve networks that include both innate properties and the ability to change and learn in response to experiences in different environments and problem domains. EPANNs' aims include autonomously creating learning systems, bootstrapping learning from scratch, recovering performance in unseen conditions, testing the computational advantages of particular neural components, and deriving hypotheses on the emergence of biological learning. Thus, EPANNs may include a large variety of different neuron types and dynamics, network architectures, plasticity rules, and other factors. While EPANNs have seen considerable progress over the last two decades, current scientific and technological advances in artificial neural networks are setting the conditions for radically new approaches and results. Exploiting the increased availability of computational resources and of simulation environments, the often challenging task of hand-designing learning neural networks could be replaced by more autonomous and creative processes. This paper brings together a variety of inspiring ideas that define the field of EPANNs. The main methods and results are reviewed. Finally, new opportunities and possible developments are presented.", "In the last decade, technology has revolutionised the way we deliver healthcare. Smartphones, tablets, personal computers and bespoke devices have provided patients with the means to access health information, manage their healthcare and communicate with health professionals remotely. Advances in technology have the potential to change how acute and long-term conditions are diagnosed and managed and how illness is prevented using technological advances in artificial intelligence, virtual and augmented reality, robotics, 3D printing, new materials, biosensor technologies and data analytics. In the future, predictive analytics will help with earlier disease diagnosis in at-risk populations.Historically, development of child health innovation and technology has taken place in a relatively emergent manner with little formal coordination. The aim is to move away from the traditional approach of repurposing adult technologies to provide a large-scale and coordinated approach for the development of bespoke health technology for children that is anatomically, physiologically and developmentally appropriate, versatile and that has been designed with children and young people. The challenge for the National Health Service alongside healthcare systems across the world is to deliver increasingly complex healthcare at lower cost and with better quality of life and greater efficiency.", "During dynamic terrestrial locomotion, animals use complex multifunctional feet to extract friction from the environment. However, whether roboticists assume sufficient surface friction for locomotion or actively compensate for slipping, they use relatively simple point-contact feet. We seek to understand and extract the morphological adaptations of animal feet that contribute to enhancing friction on diverse surfaces, such as the desert locust (Schistocerca gregaria) [Bennet-Clark HC (1975) J Exp Biol 63:53-83], which has both wet adhesive pads and spines. A buckling region in their knee to accommodate slipping [Bayley TG, Sutton GP, Burrows M (2012) J Exp Biol 215:1151-1161], slow nerve conduction velocity (0.5-3 m/s) [Pearson KG, Stein RB, Malhotra SK (1970) J Exp Biol 53:299-316], and an ecological pressure to enhance jumping performance for survival [Hawlena D, Kress H, Dufresne ER, Schmitz OJ (2011) Funct Ecol 25:279-288] further suggest that the locust operates near the limits of its surface friction, but without sufficient time to actively control its feet. Therefore, all surface adaptation must be through passive mechanics (morphological intelligence), which are unknown. Here, we report the slipping behavior, dynamic attachment, passive mechanics, and interplay between the spines and adhesive pads, studied through both biological and robotic experiments, which contribute to the locust's ability to jump robustly from diverse surfaces. We found slipping to be surface-dependent and common (e.g., wood 1.32 \u00b1 1.19 slips per jump), yet the morphological intelligence of the feet produces a significant chance to reengage the surface (e.g., wood 1.10 \u00b1 1.13 reengagements per jump). Additionally, a discovered noncontact-type jump, further studied robotically, broadens the applicability of the morphological adaptations to both static and dynamic attachment.", "Background: Multiple sclerosis has an extremely variable natural course. In most patients, disease starts with a relapsing-remitting (RR) phase, which proceeds to a secondary progressive (SP) form. The duration of the RR phase is hard to predict, and to date predictions on the rate of disease progression remain suboptimal. This limits the opportunity to tailor therapy on an individual patient's prognosis, in spite of the choice of several therapeutic options. Approaches to improve clinical decisions, such as collective intelligence of human groups and machine learning algorithms are widely investigated. Methods: Medical students and a machine learning algorithm predicted the course of disease on the basis of randomly chosen clinical records of patients that attended at the Multiple Sclerosis service of Sant'Andrea hospital in Rome. Results: A significant improvement of predictive ability was obtained when predictions were combined with a weight that depends on the consistence of human (or algorithm) forecasts on a given clinical record. Conclusions: In this work we present proof-of-principle that human-machine hybrid predictions yield better prognoses than machine learning algorithms or groups of humans alone. To strengthen and generalize this preliminary result, we propose a crowdsourcing initiative to collect prognoses by physicians on an expanded set of patients.", "Cognitive flexibility is a critical component of executive function and is strongly influenced by genetic factors. We conducted a genome-wide association study of cognitive flexibility (as measured by perseverative errors on the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test) in two sets of African American (AA) and European American (EA) subjects (Yale-Penn-1: 1,411 AAs/949 EAs; Yale-Penn-2: 1,178 AAs/1,335 EAs). We examined the association of cognitive flexibility with genotyped or imputed SNPs across the genome. In AAs, two correlated common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (rs7165213/rs35633795) in the downstream region of the noncoding gene LOC101927286 on chromosome 15 showed genome-wide significant (GWS) associations with cognitive flexibility (Yale-Penn-1: p\u2009=\u20096.0 \u00d7 10-9 /1.3 \u00d7 10-8 ; Yale-Penn-2: p\u2009=\u2009.029/.010; meta-analysis: p\u2009=\u20094.2 \u00d7 10-7 /1.0 \u00d7 10-7 ) in the same effect direction. In EAs, no GWS associations were observed. Enriched gene sets identified by Data-driven Expression-Prioritized Integration for Complex Traits (DEPICT) analysis of the top SNPs (pmeta-analysis \u2009<\u200910-5 ) included the signalosome and ubiquitin-specific peptidase 9, X-linked (USP9X) subnetwork in AAs, and abnormal frontal and occipital bone morphology in EAs. We also performed polygenic risk score (PRS) analysis to examine the genetic correlation of cognition-proxy phenotypes (general cognitive function, education attainment, childhood intelligence, and infant head circumference) and cognitive flexibility in EAs. The PRS derived from general cognitive function-associated SNPs was significantly associated with cognitive flexibility. Nongenetic factors (age, education, sex, and tobacco recency) also exerted significant effects on cognitive flexibility. Our study demonstrates that both genetic and nongenetic factors impact cognitive flexibility, and variants in genes involved in protein degradation and brain development may contribute to population variation in cognitive function.", "The 2017 Lancet Commission on Pollution and Health identified soil as an important, daily route of public exposure to a variety of pollutants. Lead and arsenic are two potential soil contaminants associated with serious health effects including reductions in intelligence, behavioral effects and aggressive or violent behavior (lead), as well as skin changes, cancer of the skin, bladder, liver and lungs and developmental delays (arsenic). In this study soil samples were collected, using US EPA methods, from gardens in four Johannesburg neighborhoods, and analyzed for lead and arsenic content using a portable X-ray fluorescence spectrometer. The results showed widely varied concentrations of arsenic and lead in soil collected across the four neighborhoods. Concentrations of lead (range: 0.1-2141.0\u202fmg/kg; mean: 241.7\u202fmg/kg (SD 282.8); median 158.1\u202fmg/kg) exceeding local and international reference levels were found in an inner city suburb, while raised arsenic concentrations (range: 0.1-65.3\u202fmg/kg; mean: 18.3\u202fmg/kg (SD 11.7); median: 19.1) were found in the gardens of a suburb located very close to a mine tailings facility. This study confirms the potential for high levels of exposure to toxic metals in residential gardens in an urban African setting. There is a pressing need for scaled up attention to the public health implications of exposure to soil pollution in developing countries.", "Considerable evidence now shows that making a reference to the self in a task modulates attention, perception, memory, and decision-making. Furthermore, the self-reference effect (SRE) cannot be reduced to domain-general factors (e.g., reward value) and is supported by distinct neural circuitry. However, it remains unknown whether self-associations modulate response execution as well. This was tested in the present study. Participants carried out a perceptual-matching task, and movement time (MT) was measured separately from reaction-time (RT; drawing on methodology from the literature on intelligence). A response box recorded 'home'-button-releases (measuring RT from stimulus onset); and a target-key positioned 14\u202fcm from the response box recorded MT (from 'home'-button-release to target-key depression). MTs of responses to self- as compared with other-person-associated stimuli were faster (with a higher proportion correct for self-related responses). We present a novel demonstration that the SRE can modulate the execution of rapid-aiming arm-movement responses. Implications of the findings are discussed, along with suggestions to guide and inspire future work in investigating how the SRE influences action.", "Text mining is an important research direction, which involves several fields, such as information retrieval, information extraction, and text categorization. In this paper, we propose an efficient multiple classifier approach to text categorization based on swarm-optimized topic modelling. The Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) can overcome the high dimensionality problem of vector space model, but identifying appropriate parameter values is critical to performance of LDA. Swarm-optimized approach estimates the parameters of LDA, including the number of topics and all the other parameters involved in LDA. The hybrid ensemble pruning approach based on combined diversity measures and clustering aims to obtain a multiple classifier system with high predictive performance and better diversity. In this scheme, four different diversity measures (namely, disagreement measure, Q-statistics, the correlation coefficient, and the double fault measure) among classifiers of the ensemble are combined. Based on the combined diversity matrix, a swarm intelligence based clustering algorithm is employed to partition the classifiers into a number of disjoint groups and one classifier (with the highest predictive performance) from each cluster is selected to build the final multiple classifier system. The experimental results based on five biomedical text benchmarks have been conducted. In the swarm-optimized LDA, different metaheuristic algorithms (such as genetic algorithms, particle swarm optimization, firefly algorithm, cuckoo search algorithm, and bat algorithm) are considered. In the ensemble pruning, five metaheuristic clustering algorithms are evaluated. The experimental results on biomedical text benchmarks indicate that swarm-optimized LDA yields better predictive performance compared to the conventional LDA. In addition, the proposed multiple classifier system outperforms the conventional classification algorithms, ensemble learning, and ensemble pruning methods.", "Increasing numbers of preterm-born children survive nowadays, and improving long-term health and neurodevelopment is becoming more important. Early-life growth has been linked to neurodevelopmental outcomes. We aimed to study whether this association has changed with time.\nWe studied two cohorts of preterm-born children (gestational age \u226432 weeks and/or birth weight \u22641500\u2009g) from 1983 (n\u2009=\u2009708) and 2003-2006 (n\u2009=\u2009138),\u00a0respectively. We distinguished four early-life growth patterns at 3 months corrected age: appropriate for gestational age (AGA) with or without growth restriction (AGA GR+/AGA GR-), and small for gestational age (SGA) with or without catch-up growth (SGA CUG+/SGA CUG-). Intelligence quotient (IQ), neuromotor function, and behavior were assessed at ages 19 and 8 years, respectively, for the cohorts.\nIn the 2003-2006 cohort, less children had early-life GR. In both cohorts, SGA CUG- subjects had unfavorable growth trajectories and neurodevelopmental outcomes (IQ \u03b2 -6.5, 95% confidence interval (CI) -9.8; -3.2, P\u2009<\u20090.001; neuromotor score \u03b2 -1.9%, 95% CI -3.2; -0.6, P\u2009=\u20090.005), while SGA CUG+ subjects were comparable to adequately grown subjects.\nAlthough the incidence of adverse growth patterns decreased between the cohorts, possibly indicating improvements in care over time, the impact of these growth patterns on neurodevelopmental outcomes was not significantly different. Achieving adequate early-life growth may be crucial for improving neurodevelopmental outcomes, especially for preterms born SGA.", "Behavioral, cognitive and functional particularities in autism differ according to autism subgroups and might be associated with domain-specific cognitive strengths. It is unknown whether structural changes support this specialization. We investigated the link between cortical folding, its maturation and cognitive strengths in autism subgroups presenting verbal or visuo-spatial peaks of abilities.\nWe measured gyrification, a structural index related to function, in 55 autistic participants with (AS-SOD, N\u202f=\u202f27) or without (AS-NoSOD, N\u202f=\u202f28) a speech onset delay (SOD) with similar symptom severity but respectively perceptual and verbal cognitive strengths, and 37 typical adolescents and young adults matched for intelligence and age. We calculated the local Gyrification Index (lGI) throughout an occipito-temporal region of interest and independently modeled age and peak of ability effects for each group.\nUnique gyrification features in both autistic groups were detected in localized clusters. When comparing the three groups, gyrification was found lower in AS-SOD in a fusiform visual area, whereas it was higher in AS-NoSOD in a temporal language-related region. These particular areas presented age-related gyrification differences reflecting contrasting local maturation pathways in AS. As expected, peaks of ability were found in a verbal subtest for the AS-NoSOD group and in the Block Design IQ subtest for the AS-SOD group.\nIrrespective of their direction, regional gyrification differences in visual and language processing areas respectively reflect AS-SOD perceptual and AS-NoSOD language-oriented peaks. Unique regional maturation trajectories in the autistic brain may underline specific cognitive strengths, which are key variables for understanding heterogeneity in autism.", "With the recent advances in DNA sequencing technologies, the study of the genetic composition of living organisms has become more accessible for researchers. Several advances have been achieved because of it, especially in the health sciences. However, many challenges which emerge from the complexity of sequencing projects remain unsolved. Among them is the task of assembling DNA fragments from previously unsequenced organisms, which is classified as an NP-hard (nondeterministic polynomial time hard) problem, for which no efficient computational solution with reasonable execution time exists. However, several tools that produce approximate solutions have been used with results that have facilitated scientific discoveries, although there is ample room for improvement. As with other NP-hard problems, machine learning algorithms have been one of the approaches used in recent years in an attempt to find better solutions to the DNA fragment assembly problem, although still at a low scale.\nThis paper presents a broad review of pioneering literature comprising artificial intelligence-based DNA assemblers-particularly the ones that use machine learning-to provide an overview of state-of-the-art approaches and to serve as a starting point for further study in this field.", "Pharmacovigilance (PV) is a relatively new discipline in the pharmaceutical industry. Having undergone rapid growth over the past 2 decades, PV now touches many other disciplines in the research and development enterprise. With its growth has come a heightened awareness and interest in the medical community about the roles that PV plays. This article provides insights into the background and inner workings of PV.\nThis narrative review covers the core PV activities and other major areas of the pharmaceutical enterprise in which PV makes significant contributions.\nDrug safety monitoring activities were organized by the US Food and Drug Administration and academic medical centers in the early 1950s in response to growing concern over the occurrence of aplastic anemia and other blood dyscrasias associated with the use of chloramphenicol. This experience was codified in the 1962 Kefauver-Harris Amendments to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act as adverse event evaluation and reporting requirements. The ensuing decades have seen the development of core PV functions for pharmaceutical companies: case management, signal management, and benefit-risk management. A broader scope of PV has developed to include the following major activities: support of patient safety during the conduct of clinical trials through assuring proper use of informed consent and institutional review boards (ethics committees); selection of the first safe dose for use in humans, based on pharmacologic data obtained in animal studies; development of the safety profile for proper use of a new molecular entity and appropriate communication of that information to the range of relevant stakeholders; attendance to surveillance activities through a set of signal management processes; monitoring the manufactured product itself through collaborative activities with manufacturing professionals; management of benefit-risk to assure appropriate use in medical care after marketing; and maintenance of inspection readiness as a corporate cultural process.\nThe extent and pace of change promise to accelerate with the integration of biomedical informatics, analytics, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. This progress has implications for the development of the next generation of PV professionals who will need to be trained in entirely new skill sets to lead continued improvements in the safe use of pharmaceuticals.", "The General Aggression Model (GAM) offers an integrative explanation of the aggressive behavior based on three stages: 1) inputs: personal and situational factors; 2) routes or individual internal states: affect, cognition, and arousal; and 3) outcomes: decision processes with a (non) aggressive result. Researchers are interested in looking for protective factors within the GAM to diminish aggression. Previous studies have found two relevant variables acting independently as risk and protective factors: emotional intelligence (EI) and negative affect (NA). The aim of the present study is to analyze a moderated mediation model including these variables as an explanation of aggressive behavior and integrate it within the GAM. Four hundred and six participants were assessed on EI, NA, and aggression. The moderated mediation analysis showed a significant negative indirect effect of the perceiving EI branch on total aggression mediated through NA levels, which, in turn, was moderated by the managing EI branch. Moreover, this relationship was also observed for the physical, anger, and hostility sub-scales of aggression. Our study demonstrates the importance of having a high ability to perceive emotions as a protective factor in the first stage of the GAM. These individuals will present lower NA in the second stage of the model, resulting in a reduction in aggression. Moreover, having a high ability to perceive emotions is particularly relevant for individuals that are less able to manage emotions, given that those participants with higher scores on the managing EI branch can reduce their aggressive behavior by mitigating the effect of NA on aggression in the third stage of the GAM.", "Scientists want to comprehend and control complex systems. Their success depends on the ability to face also the challenges of the corresponding computational complexity. A promising research line is artificial intelligence (AI). In AI, fuzzy logic plays a significant role because it is a suitable model of the human capability to compute with words, which is relevant when we make decisions in complex situations. The concept of fuzzy set pervades the natural information systems (NISs), such as living cells, the immune and the nervous systems. This paper describes the fuzziness of the NISs, in particular of the human nervous system. Moreover, it traces three pathways to process fuzzy logic by molecules and their assemblies. The fuzziness of the molecular world is useful for the development of the chemical artificial intelligence (CAI). CAI will help to face the challenges that regard both the natural and the computational complexity.", "The quality of decision and assessment of risk are key determinants of successful sport performance. Athletes differ fundamentally in their decision-making ability according to their athletic expertise level. Moreover, given the influence of emotions on decision-making, it is likely that a trait reflecting emotional functioning, trait emotional intelligence, may also influence decision-making. Therefore, the aim of this research was to investigate the respective contribution of athletic expertise and trait emotional intelligence to non-athletic decision-making. In total, 269 participants aged between 18 and 26 years with a range of athletic experience i.e. none (n\u2009=\u200971), novice (n\u2009=\u200954), amateur (n\u2009=\u200955), elite (n\u2009=\u200945) and super-elite (n\u2009=\u200944), completed the Emotional Intelligence Scale and the Cambridge Gambling Task. Regression modelling indicated a significant positive relationship of athletic expertise and trait emotional intelligence with the quality of decision-making, and a negative relationship with deliberation time and risk-taking. Cognitive skills transfer may explain the higher decision-making scores associated with higher athletic expertise, while individuals with higher trait emotional intelligence may anticipate better the emotional consequences linked with a gambling task, which may help individuals make better decisions and take less risks.", "The profit of greenhouse production is influenced by management activities (e.g., environmental control and plantation scheduling) as well as social conditions (e.g., price fluctuation). In China, the prevailing horticultural facility is the traditional solar greenhouse. The key existing problem is the lack of knowledge of growers, which in turn leads to inefficient management, low production, or unsalable products. To secure effective greenhouse management, the production planning system must account for the crop growing environment, grower's activities, and the market. This paper presents an agricultural cyber-physical-social system (CPSS) serving agricultural production management, with a case study on the solar greenhouse. The system inputs are derived from social and physical sensors, with the former collecting the price of agricultural products in a wholesale market, and the latter collecting the necessary environmental data in the solar greenhouse. Decision support for the cropping plan is provided by the artificial system, computational experiment, and parallel execution-based method, with description intelligence for estimating the crop development and harvest time, prediction intelligence for optimizing the planting time and area according to the expected targets (stable production or maximum gross profit), and prescription intelligence for online system training. The presented system fits the current technical and economic situation of horticulture in China. The application of agricultural CPSS could decrease waste in labor or fertilizer and support sustainable agricultural production.", "The prognosis of esophageal cancer is relatively poor. Patients are usually diagnosed at an advanced stage when it is often too late for effective treatment. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) using deep learning has made remarkable progress in medicine. However, there are no reports on its application for diagnosing esophageal cancer. Here, we demonstrate the diagnostic ability of AI to detect esophageal cancer including squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma.\nWe retrospectively collected 8428 training images of esophageal cancer from 384 patients at the Cancer Institute Hospital, Japan. Using these, we developed deep learning through convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We also prepared 1118 test images for 47 patients with 49 esophageal cancers and 50 patients without esophageal cancer to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy.\nThe CNN took 27 seconds to analyze 1118 test images and correctly detected esophageal cancer cases with a sensitivity of 98%. CNN could detect all 7 small cancer lesions less than 10\u00a0mm in size. Although the positive predictive value for each image was 40%, misdiagnosing shadows and normal structures led to a negative predictive value of 95%. The CNN could distinguish superficial esophageal cancer from advanced cancer with an accuracy of 98%.\nThe constructed CNN system for detecting esophageal cancer can analyze stored endoscopic images in a short time with high sensitivity. However, more training would lead to higher diagnostic accuracy. This system can facilitate early detection in practice, leading to a better prognosis in the near future.", "Depression, which is common following acquired brain injury (ABI), has been shown to predict cognitive impairment, rehabilitation outcome, and quality of life. Whilst many studies have examined links between depression and cognitive-affective processing in the non-ABI population, their applicability to this important clinical group, where cognitive difficulties can be marked, remains unknown. Here, we investigated biases in prospective cognition, which is known to be disrupted in (non-ABI) depression yet important for well-being.\nCross-sectional design with three groups (depressed ABI, non-depressed ABI, and non-ABI control participants). Continuous data were additionally analysed in correlation analyses.\nIndividuals with ABI varying in extent of self-reported depression and matched non-ABI control participants completed assessments of mood and prospective cognition (anticipating and imagining future events), alongside background tests of executive function and fluid intelligence.\nRelative to non-depressed ABI and control participants, depressed ABI individuals demonstrated a reduced positive bias in prospective cognition: whereas non-depressed ABI and control participants generated more examples of likely or possible positive versus negative future events, there was no evidence for such a positive bias in depressed ABI participants. Non-depressed ABI and control participants also reported more vivid mental imagery for positive versus negative future scenarios, whereas such a pattern was not evident in depressed ABI participants. This pattern emerged despite background impairments in fluid intelligence and executive function associated with ABI.\nThese findings (1) elucidate depression-linked cognitive-affective processes following ABI, where cognitive difficulties are common, and (2) highlight psychological processes associated with depression that are common to ABI and non-ABI populations.\nClinical implications A relative negative bias in future-directed cognition is associated with depressed mood in individuals with chronic ABI. Such processes may contribute to the onset and maintenance of depression following ABI. These findings suggest it may be important to consider a role for prospective cognition in psychological interventions for depression following ABI. Limitations of the study The extent to which depressed mood following ABI is associated with biases in other cognitive domains remains unclear. Whether similar patterns would be observed in acute patients with more profound cognitive difficulties requires further investigation. Despite large effect sizes, our sample size is modest; these effects thus require replication in larger groups.", "We have recently seen many successful applications of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) on electronic medical records (EMRs), which contain histories of patients' diagnoses, medications, and other various events, in order to predict the current and future states of patients. Despite the strong performance of RNNs, it is often challenging for users to understand why the model makes a particular prediction. Such black-box nature of RNNs can impede its wide adoption in clinical practice. Furthermore, we have no established methods to interactively leverage users' domain expertise and prior knowledge as inputs for steering the model. Therefore, our design study aims to provide a visual analytics solution to increase interpretability and interactivity of RNNs via a joint effort of medical experts, artificial intelligence scientists, and visual analytics researchers. Following the iterative design process between the experts, we design, implement, and evaluate a visual analytics tool called RetainVis, which couples a newly improved, interpretable, and interactive RNN-based model called RetainEX and visualizations for users' exploration of EMR data in the context of prediction tasks. Our study shows the effective use of RetainVis for gaining insights into how individual medical codes contribute to making risk predictions, using EMRs of patients with heart failure and cataract symptoms. Our study also demonstrates how we made substantial changes to the state-of-the-art RNN model called RETAIN in order to make use of temporal information and increase interactivity. This study will provide a useful guideline for researchers that aim to design an interpretable and interactive visual analytics tool for RNNs.", "Drug discovery, which is the process of discovering new candidate medications, is very important for pharmaceutical industries. At its current stage, discovering new drugs is still a very expensive and time-consuming process, requiring Phases I, II and III for clinical trials. Recently, machine learning techniques in Artificial Intelligence (AI), especially the deep learning techniques which allow a computational model to generate multiple layers, have been widely applied and achieved state-of-the-art performance in different fields, such as speech recognition, image classification, bioinformatics, etc. One very important application of these AI techniques is in the field of drug discovery.\nWe did a large-scale literature search on existing scientific websites (e.g, ScienceDirect, Arxiv) and startup companies to understand current status of machine learning techniques in drug discovery.\nOur experiments demonstrated that there are different patterns in machine learning fields and drug discovery fields. For example, keywords like prediction, brain, discovery, and treatment are usually in drug discovery fields. Also, the total number of papers published in drug discovery fields with machine learning techniques is increasing every year.\nThe main focus of this survey is to understand the current status of machine learning techniques in the drug discovery field within both academic and industrial settings, and discuss its potential future applications. Several interesting patterns for machine learning techniques in drug discovery fields are discussed in this survey.", "This case-control study examined the long-term consequences of surgical correction for ventricular septal defect (VSD; the most common congenital heart defect) in infancy. It assessed children who had undergone VSD surgery and the factors related to maternal conditions, surgery, and hospital stay.\nThirty-nine children (23 females, 16 males; age range 6y 1mo-9y 7mo [mean 7y 4mo, SD 1y]) with repaired isolated, non-syndromic, non-genetic VSD were compared with 39 typically developing children (22 females, 17 males; age range 6y-9y 2mo [mean 7y 3mo, SD 10mo]). The children completed behavioural tests of neurodevelopment and a quality of life (QoL) questionnaire. Mothers rated children's emotional/behavioural symptoms and QoL. Measures of maternal parenting behaviour and psychopathology were treated as moderators.\nAffected children showed reduced language skills (p=0.002) unless mothers reported high parenting behaviour subscale scores (p=0.04). Children's anxiety symptoms were elevated when mothers had anxiety symptoms (p=0.01). Longer hospital stay was associated with lower intelligence (p=0.003) and psychomotor scores (p=0.006). Longer scars predicted elevated child anxiety (p=0.008), and age at surgery and QoL were inversely related (p=0.01).\nImpairments could be mitigated if VSD repair was performed early in life with a relatively small scar and uncomplicated hospital stay. This outcome depends on maternal parenting behaviour and anxiety symptoms.\nChildren's cognitive and psychomotor development after surgical ventricular septal defect repair was unimpaired. Children showed no mental health restrictions when their mothers reported few anxiety symptoms themselves. Language impairments might be preventable by pro-active parenting. The outcome also depends on variables related to surgery and hospital stay.", "HIV status disclosure is associated with increased sorcial support and protective behaviors against HIV transmission. Yet disclosure poses significant challenges in the face of persistent societal stigma. Few interventions focus on decision-making self-efficacy, and communication skills to support disclosing HIV status to an intimate partner. Virtual reality (VR) and artifcial intelligence (AI) technologies offer poweful tools to address this gap. Informed by Social Cognitive Theory, we created the Tough Talks VR program for HIV-positive young men who have sex with men (YMSM) to practice status disclosure safely and confidentially. Fifty-eight YMSM (ages 18 - 30, 88% HIV-positive) contributed 132 disclosure dialogues to develop the prototype through focus groups, usability testing, and a technical pilot. The prototype includes three disclosure scenarios (neutral, sympathetic, and negative response) and a database of 125 virtual character utterances. Participants select a VR scenario and realistic virtual character with whom to practice. In a pilot test of the fully automated neutral response scenario, the AI system responded appropriately to 71% of participant utterances. Most pilot study participants agreed Tough Talks was easy to use (9/11) and that they would like to use the system frequently (9/11). Tough Talks demonstrates that VR can be used to practice HIV status disclosure and lessons learned from program development offer insights for the use of AI systems for other areas of health and education.", "Off-label prescription is a common practice in psychiatry, raising health and economic concerns. Collegial consultation could allow a framed prescription of treatments that are not authorized in specific indications. Attention Deficit Hyperactivity in adult populations (ADHD) is a striking example of a pathology where off-label prescription is frequent. First considered to be a childhood disorder, the awareness of this condition in adults is increasing, leading to the development of new clinical practices and treatments. However, the adult ADHD diagnosis and its management are still emerging in France despite a high prevalence. Treatment of adult ADHD relies on methylphenidate prescription, but the initiation of this drug is not authorized in adult populations. Methylphenidate is a central nervous system stimulant that is structurally close to amphetamine and acts as a norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake inhibitor. Due to these pharmacological properties, neuropsychiatric and cardiovascular side-effects could occur. Furthermore, its addictive potential has led France to classify it as a psychoactive drug, dispensed via secured prescription. The first prescription and the one-year follow-up are restricted to neurologists, paediatrics, psychiatrists and sleep disorders specialists at hospital. The objective of this article is to propose a multidisciplinary framework for the off-label prescription of methylphenidate in adult ADHD.\nThe Multidisciplinary Advice Consultation for Exceptional Addiction Treatments (Consultation d'Avis Multidisciplinaire de Traitements d'Exception en Addictologie CAMTEA) was first set up in Lille for the prescription of baclofen in alcohol dependence and was then extended to topiramate in binge eating disorder. This procedure has been adapted to the particularities of ADHD in adult populations, the differential diagnosis (bipolar disorder, depressive disorder, anxious disorder, personality disorder, substance use disorder) and the co-morbidities requiring a full psychiatric and neuropsychological assessment. Moreover, a particular attention has been paid to the monitoring of neuropsychiatric, cardiovascular and misuse risk because of the potential side-effects of methylphenidate.\nThe proposed prescription framework is structured into several specialized consultations. A first psychiatric evaluation aims to diagnose adult ADHD, using the French version of the Diagnostisch Interview Voor ADHD 2.0\u00a0questionnaire (DIVA 2.0), and to assess the quality of life impact with the Weiss Functional Inventory Rating Scale (WIFRS). It also searches for the presence of differential diagnosis or co-morbidities. The second appointment consists of a pharmacological evaluation that aims to search for contraindications and potential drug interaction. A neuropsychological evaluation based on standardized tests (Weschler Adulte Intelligence Scale [WAIS IV], Conner's Continuous Performance Test 3 [CPT] and the Minnesota Multiphasic Personnality Inventory [MMPI]) is also required to evaluate neurocognitive disabilities and personality features. Once the parameters of the different assessments have been collected, the synthesis is presented during a multidisciplinary meeting in order to assess the risk-benefit ratio for each patient. Several specialties are involved in this multidisciplinary meeting: psychiatry, addictology, general medicine, addictovigilance, pharmacovigilance and neuropsychology. One strategy among three possibilities can be decided: (1) contraindication to treatment with methylphenidate, (2) attention deficit disorder that does not require medication management, and (3) indication of treatment with methylphenidate with the choice of the pharmacological form (immediate or prolonged release). A biological check-up and an electrocardiogram are carried out systematically before any treatment. If the decision is made to initiate treatment, it is started at the lowest dosage and followed by a titration phase. A weekly follow-up is carried out during the titration phase in order to assess treatment efficacy and safety. After treatment stabilization, the general practitioner can carry out the renewal, and the patient will be reassessed within the framework of the multidisciplinary consultation every 3\u00a0months.\nWhen an off-label prescription is being considered, it must comply with the basic rules of good clinical practice, and the benefit/risk ratio should be constantly reassessed. The proposed multidisciplinary framework, adapted to the characteristics of adult ADHD and the pharmacological properties of methylphenidate, appears to be an interesting strategy to meet the requirements of the good clinical practice. The complementary assessments carried out and the collegial framework allow enhancing the patient's follow-up and minimize the drug risk, particularly in the psychiatric, addictive and cardiovascular adverse events. Finally, this framework could also help the monitoring of other off-label treatments for ADHD, such as atomoxetine or guanfacine.", "Social-emotional expertise (SEE) represents a synthesis of specific cognitive abilities related to social interactions, and emphasizes the timing and synchrony of behaviors that contribute to overall social-emotional ability. As a step toward SEE construct validation, we conducted three experiments to develop a self-report measure that captured key elements of our conceptualization of SEE. In Experiment 1, we generated and tested 76 items for a measure of SEE. The resultant 25-item scale is reliable, test-retest: r(80) = .82, p < .001, and internally consistent (Cronbach's \u03b1 = .90). Experiments 2 and 3 examined the relationships between the SEE Scale and related constructs. Convergent constructs, such as emotional intelligence, r(885) = .62, p < .01, and social anxiety, r(885) = -.59, p < .01, and discriminant constructs, such as social desirability, r(885) = .19, p < .01, and self-monitoring, r(885) = .28, p < .01, were found to be related in the expected directions. Additionally, two factors were statistically identified: Adaptability and Expressivity. The items contributing to each factor describe the ability to successfully navigate social environments and the ability to successfully convey affect and ideas to other people, respectively. These factors correlate with related constructs in distinct and theoretically relevant ways.", "The objective of this study was to examine 1) whether teens' glycemic control and adherence to type 1 diabetes treatment regimen worsen during the transition from late adolescence to emerging adulthood, and 2) whether teens' executive function (EF), as measured by performance and self-reported problems with EF, is predictive of these changes (after controlling for general intelligence).\nHigh school seniors with type 1 diabetes (N = 236; mean age 17.74 years) were assessed at three yearly time points. At baseline, during the senior year of high school, participants completed a self-report measure of problems with EF and performance-based measures of EF and general intelligence (IQ). Glycemic control was determined on the basis of results collected from HbA1c assay kits, and teens reported their adherence at all three time points.\nHbA1c increased significantly across the three time points and adherence declined. EF performance was not associated with adherence or HbA1c at baseline, nor with changes in adherence over time. However, better EF performance predicted slower increases in HbA1c over time (i.e., slope) while controlling for IQ. Teens' self-reported problems with EF were associated with worse glycemic control and poorer adherence at baseline (i.e., intercept), but they did not predict changes in either HbA1c or adherence over time (i.e., slope).\nAbilities involved in performance on EF tests may be one resource for maintaining better glycemic control during the transition to emerging adulthood. Assessment of such EF abilities may allow for the identification of individuals who are most at risk for deterioration of glycemic control during this transition.", "Worldwide interest in artificial intelligence (AI) applications is growing rapidly. In medicine, devices based on machine/deep learning have proliferated, especially for image analysis, presaging new significant challenges for the utility of AI in healthcare. This inevitably raises numerous legal and ethical questions. In this paper we analyse the state of AI regulation in the context of medical device development, and strategies to make AI applications safe and useful in the future. We analyse the legal framework regulating medical devices and data protection in Europe and in the United States, assessing developments that are currently taking place. The European Union (EU) is reforming these fields with new legislation (General Data Protection Regulation [GDPR], Cybersecurity Directive, Medical Devices Regulation, In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Device Regulation). This reform is gradual, but it has now made its first impact, with the GDPR and the Cybersecurity Directive having taken effect in May, 2018. As regards the United States (U.S.), the regulatory scene is predominantly controlled by the Food and Drug Administration. This paper considers issues of accountability, both legal and ethical. The processes of medical device decision-making are largely unpredictable, therefore holding the creators accountable for it clearly raises concerns. There is a lot that can be done in order to regulate AI applications. If this is done properly and timely, the potentiality of AI based technology, in radiology as well as in other fields, will be invaluable. TEACHING POINTS: \u2022 AI applications are medical devices supporting detection/diagnosis, work-flow, cost-effectiveness. \u2022 Regulations for safety, privacy protection, and ethical use of sensitive information are needed. \u2022 EU and U.S. have different approaches for approving and regulating new medical devices. \u2022 EU laws consider cyberattacks, incidents (notification and minimisation), and service continuity. \u2022 U.S. laws ask for opt-in data processing and use as well as for clear consumer consent.", "Corporations are increasingly being targeted by activist groups seeking to influence their business decisions. Activists target companies for a variety of reasons. Some feel companies have too much power over their lives; some feel companies put profits over people; and others feel the companies' actions exploit people, animals and/or the environment. Some companies are targeted simply because they have a business relationship with a targeted company. While most activists use peaceful protests as a way of voicing their opinions, others resort to criminal activity to influence corporate decisions. Radical extremists use tactics of intimidation, threats and criminal activity to achieve their goal. Activist campaigns typically follow leaderless resistance models in which a number of organisations or individuals move against a targeted industry or company. These groups operate autonomously but share ideas, information and research. Preparation and planning is the difference between companies that endure an activist campaign and those that are unable to recover fully. The preparation process should include the following steps: (1) evaluate risk and exposure, (2) conduct a vulnerability assessment, (3) do advanced planning, and (4) engage in intelligence monitoring.", "One case of family chromosomal karyotype with complex chromosomal translocation and male infertility was reported. This case is a male, 30 years old, Han nationality, who did not receive contraception for 3 years after marriage. The phenotype and intelligence of the patients were normal, and there were no abnormalities in the external genitalia. No abnormalities were found in the prostate and spermatic vein. There was no history of parotitis or testicular trauma, no history of smoking, drinking history, denial of harmful substances and history of radioactive contact. There were no similar patients in the family, and the secondary sex was normal. The routine semen examination suggested that the active sperm was seldom seen. There were no obvious abnormalities in the serum endocrine examination of the patient. Cytogenetic examination: the patient's karyotype 46XY, t (10; 18; 21) (q22; p11.2; q11.2). There was no deletion in locus sY84, sY86, sY127, sY134, sY143, sY254 and sY255. His wife's examination showed no obvious abnormality, and her karyotype was normal. The parents of the patients were not close relatives. Their father's chromosome karyotype analysis was 46, XY, and Y chromosome microdeletion was normal. The chromosome karyotype of the parent was 46XX, t (10; 18; 21), and the parents of the patient also had a daughter, whose phenotype and intellectual development were normal, chromosome karyotype 46XX, t (10; 18; 21). In this case, the patient's balance translocation should be inherited by the mother. Because of the normal phenotype of the patient, there was no loss of genetic material, but the abnormal chromosomes might be passed to the offspring, and the proportion of the unbalanced gametes was very high. Through systematic review and review of the cases, it was concluded that the balanced translocation carriers only changed the relative position of the translocation segments on the chromosomes, retained the total number of the original genes, only changed the relative position of the genes on the chromosomes, and had no serious effect on the role of the gene and the development of the individual. The phenotype was normal. The patients were given symptomatic treatment to improve semen quality. It is recommended that pre-implantation genetic screening/diagnosis(PGS/PGD) be performed if necessary. It is to guide married men and women to choose the appropriate childbearing age, avoid unhealthy environmental contacts, and strengthen genetic screening before and after pregnancy, so as to achieve the goal of eugenics.", "The so-called Thompson-score (TS) for newborns with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) was developed before the introduction of controlled hypothermia as clinical routine. Information on the predictive value of TS in newborns undergoing therapeutic hypothermia to estimate long-term outcome is limited.\nTo determine the predictive value of TS to estimate long-term cognitive and neurological outcome in newborns with perinatal asphyxia treated with controlled hypothermia.\nThirty-six term newborns with HIE undergoing controlled hypothermia were followed using Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of intelligence III test and standardized neurological examination. The primary outcome was survival without cognitive impairment, defined as an IQ \u226585. Secondary outcomes were motor outcomes, survival without relevant neurological impairment, death and epilepsy.\nFollow-up was done in 33 out of 36 (91.6%) infants at 53 \u00b1 12\u00a0months (mean \u00b1 SD). For all investigated parameters, a statistically significant relationship with peak TS was demonstrated. A one-point increase in peak TS indicated an OR (95% CI) of 1.5 (1.1-2.0, p = 0.006) for death or cognitive impairment, an OR (95% CI) of 2.2 (1.3-3.8, p = 0.004) for death or relevant neurologic impairment, an OR (95% CI) of 2.1 (1.3-3.5, p = 0.005) for death or epilepsy and an OR (95% CI) of 1.5 (1.1-2.1, p = 0.02) for death. Although the TS for newborns with adverse outcome (death or cognitive impairment) compared to normal outcome tended to be higher (13 [4-16] vs. 9 [0-13], d1; 15 [5-19] vs. 9 [1-14], d2; 14 [5-21] vs. 8 [2-15], d3; median [range]), there was a considerable overlap during the first 3 days of life between both groups.\nThe TS seems to be a prognostic tool for predicting the long-term outcome in asphyxiated term newborns undergoing controlled hypothermia after the third day of life. A higher score appears to be significantly associated with an adverse outcome.", "Seed viability monitoring is very important in ex situ germplasm preservation to detect germplasm deterioration. This requires seed-, time- and labor- saving methods with high precision to assess seed germination as viability. Although the current non-invasive, rapid, sensing methods (NRSs) are time- and labor-saving, they lack the precision and simplicity which are the virtues of traditional germination. Moreover, they consume a considerable amount of seeds to adjust sensed signals to germination percentage, which disregards the seed-saving objective. This becomes particularly severe for rare or endangered species whose seeds are already scarce. Here we propose a new method that is precise, low-invasive, simple, and quick, which involves analyzing the pattern of dehiscence (seed coat rupture), followed by embryonic protrusion.\nDehiscence proved simple to identify. After the trial of 20 treatments from 3 rice varieties, we recognized that dehiscence percentage at the 48th hour of germination (D(48)) correlates significantly with germination rate for tested seed lots. In addition, we found that the final germination percentage corresponded to D(48) plus 5. More than 70% of the seeds survived post-dehiscence desiccation for storage. Hydrogen peroxide (1\u00a0mM) as the solution for imbibition could further improve the survival. The method also worked quicker than tetrazolium which is honored as a fast, traditional method, in detecting less vigorous but viable seeds.\nWe demonstrated the comprehensive virtues of dehiscence method in assessing rice seed: it is more precise and easier to use than NRSs and is faster and more seed-saving than traditional methods. We anticipate modifications including artificial intelligence to extend our method to increasingly diverse circumstances and species.", "The primary aim of this study was to develop a survey addressing an individual's non-cognitive traits, such as emotional intelligence, interpersonal skills, social intelligence, psychological flexibility, and grit. Such a tool would provide beneficial information for the continued development of admissions standards and would help better capture the full breadth of experience and capabilities of applicants applying to doctor of physical therapy (DPT) programs.\nThis was a cross-sectional survey study involving learners in DPT programs at 3 academic institutions in the United States. A survey was developed based on established non-proprietary, non-cognitive measures affiliated with success and resilience. The survey was assessed for face validity, and exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was used to identify subgroups of factors based on responses to the items.\nA total of 298 participants (90.3%) completed all elements of the survey. EFA yielded 39 items for dimensional assessment with regression coefficients < 0.4. Within the 39 items, 3 latent constructs were identified: adaptability (16 items), intuitiveness (12 items), and engagement (11 items).\nThis preliminary non-cognitive assessment survey will be able to play a valuable role in DPT admissions decisions following further examination and refinement.", "Patients' postoperative facial swelling following third molars extraction may have both biological impacts and social impacts. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of artificial neural networks in the prediction of the postoperative facial swelling following the impacted mandibular third molars extraction. The improved conjugate grads BP algorithm combining with adaptive BP algorithm and conjugate gradient BP algorithm together was used. In this neural networks model, the functional projective relationship was established among patient's personal factors, anatomy factors of third molars and factors of surgical procedure to facial swelling following impacted mandibular third molars extraction. This neural networks model was trained and tested based on the data from 400 patients, in which 300 patients were made as the training samples, and another100 patients were assigned as the test samples. The improved conjugate grads BP algorithm was able to not only avoid the problem of local minimum effectively, but also improve the networks training speed greatly. 5-fold cross-validation was used to get a better sense of the predictive accuracy of the neural network and early stopping was used to improve generalization. The accuracy of this model was 98.00% for the prediction of facial swelling following impacted mandibular third molars extraction. This artificial intelligence model is approved as an accurate method for prediction of the facial swelling following impacted mandibular third molars extraction.", "To compare the anterior temporal lobectomy (ATL) with transsylvian selective amygdalohippocampectomy (SeAH) in 72 patients with medial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) regarding the seizure control and neuropsychological outcomes.\u2029 Methods: Clinical data and follow-up data were collected and retrospectively analyzed. SeAH and ATL were used in 39 and 33 patients, respectively. All eligible patients were followed up at least one year. Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised and the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised were used to test the patients' neuropsychology before and after the surgery for one year.\u2029 Results: Fifty-nine patients (81.9%) achieved satisfactory seizure control (62.5% Engel Class I and 19.4% Class II). ATL obtained 84.8% satisfactory seizure control (28 patients), and the success rate was 79.5% (31 patients) for SeAH. There was no significant difference in seizure control between SeAH and ATL (P=0.760). The postoperative verbal IQ of SeAH group increased significantly in both side surgery (P<0.05), while the increase was not significant in the group of ATL of both side surgery (P>0.05). Regarding left-side surgery, postoperative verbal memory and total memory were increased significantly in the group of SeAH (P<0.05), while the increases were not significant in the group of ATL (P>0.05). In the right-side surgery, postoperative verbal memory and total memory were increased significantly in the two surgery strategy groups (P<0.05), while no significant increases were seen in non-verbal memory of the two surgery strategy groups (P>0.05).\u2029 Conclusion: Microsurgery for the treatment of refractory MTLE is successful and safe, and should be encouraged. The seizure outcome is not different between ATL and SeAH, while regarding as verbal IQ and verbal memory outcomes, SeAH may be superior to ATL in dominant hemisphere surgery.\n\u76ee\u7684\uff1a\u6bd4\u8f83\u524d\u989e\u53f6\u5207\u9664\u672f(anterior temporal lobectomy\uff0cATL)\u4e0e\u7ecf\u4fa7\u88c2\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u674f\u4ec1\u6838\u6d77\u9a6c\u5207\u9664\u672f(selective amygdalohippocampectomy\uff0cSeAH)\u6cbb\u7597\u989e\u53f6\u5185\u4fa7\u766b\u75eb(medial temporal lobe epilepsy\uff0cMTLE)\u5728\u63a7\u5236\u766b\u75eb\u53d1\u4f5c\u548c\u6539\u5584\u795e\u7ecf\u5fc3\u7406\u5b66\u7ed3\u679c\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u7597\u6548\u3002\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u56de\u987e\u6027\u5206\u6790SeAH(39\u4f8b)\u548cATL(33\u4f8b)\u6cbb\u7597\u768472\u4f8bMTLE\u60a3\u8005\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u8d44\u6599\u548c\u968f\u8bbf\u8d44\u6599\u3002\u4e34\u5e8a\u5fc3\u7406\u8bc4\u4f30\u91c7\u7528Wechsler\u6210\u4eba\u667a\u529b\u91cf\u8868\u548cWechsler\u8bb0\u5fc6\u91cf\u8868\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\uff1a72\u4f8b\u60a3\u8005\u4e2d59\u4f8b(81.9%)\u83b7\u5f97\u6ee1\u610f\u7684\u766b\u75eb\u63a7\u5236(62.5% Class I\u548c19.4% Class II)\u3002ATL\u7ec4\u766b\u75eb\u63a7\u5236\u6ee1\u610f28\u4f8b(84.8%)\uff0cSeAH\u7ec4\u6ee1\u610f31\u4f8b(79.5%)\uff0c\u4e24\u8005\u4e4b\u95f4\u5dee\u5f02\u65e0\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u610f\u4e49(P=0.76)\u3002SeAH\u7ec4\u5de6\u4fa7\u548c\u53f3\u4fa7\u624b\u672f\u672f\u540e\u8bed\u8a00IQ\u8bc4\u5206\u5747\u660e\u663e\u589e\u52a0(P<0.05)\uff0c\u800cATL\u7ec4\u5de6\u4fa7\u548c\u53f3\u4fa7\u624b\u672f\u540e\u8bed\u8a00IQ\u8bc4\u5206\u589e\u52a0\u65e0\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u610f\u4e49(P>0.05)\uff1b\u5de6\u4fa7SeAH\u624b\u672f\u540e\u8bed\u8a00\u8bb0\u5fc6\u548c\u603b\u8bb0\u5fc6\u8bc4\u5206\u663e\u8457\u589e\u52a0(P<0.05)\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u5de6\u4fa7ATL\u624b\u672f\u540e\u8bed\u8a00\u8bb0\u5fc6\u3001\u975e\u8bed\u8a00\u8bb0\u5fc6\u3001\u603b\u8bb0\u5fc6\u8bc4\u5206\u589e\u52a0\u65e0\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u610f\u4e49(P>0.05)\uff1b\u53f3\u4fa7\u624b\u672f\u4e24\u79cd\u672f\u5f0f\u7684\u624b\u672f\u540e\u8bed\u8a00\u8bb0\u5fc6\u548c\u603b\u8bb0\u5fc6\u8bc4\u5206\u663e\u8457\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u975e\u8bed\u8a00\u8bb0\u5fc6\u8bc4\u5206\u589e\u52a0\u65e0\u7edf\u8ba1\u610f\u4e49(P>0.05)\u3002\u7ed3\u8bba\uff1aATL\u4e0eSeAH\u662f\u6cbb\u7597MTLE\u7684\u6709\u6548\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0cATL\u4e0eSeAH\u4e24\u79cd\u672f\u5f0f\u5bf9\u766b\u75eb\u63a7\u5236\u65e0\u660e\u663e\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u672f\u540e\u8bed\u8a00\u667a\u5546\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u8bb0\u5fc6\u800c\u8a00\uff0c\u5728\u4f18\u52bf\u534a\u7403\u4fa7\u624b\u672f\u65f6SeAH\u4f18\u4e8eATL\u3002.", "The ability to detect covert markers of incipient cognitive decline among older adults before cognitive decline becomes overtly evident on traditional cognitive tests represents an important topic of research. Exaggerated reactions to novelty, reflected in novelty-induced increases in action planning latencies (\"novelty effect\"; NE) and low openness to experience (openness), have been previously associated with incipient cognitive decline among older adults who appeared cognitively normal at baseline. The purposes of the present study were to extend prior research on the utility of these markers by examining whether (a) NE and openness each predict cognitive change uniquely, and (b) whether these indices predict cognitive change above and beyond measures of memory, executive functions, processing speed/efficiency, premorbid IQ, and depressive symptoms.\nSixty-one cognitively normal community-dwelling older adults were administered a battery of tests assessing the relevant constructs at baseline and one-year follow up. Changes in cognitive status were assessed using the Demetia Rating Scale, 2nd Edition, NE was assessed using the Push-Turn-Taptap task (an electronic motor sequence learning task), and openness using the NEO Personality Inventory-Revised. The Test of Premorbid Functioning, and subtests from Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status, Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System, and Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, 4th Edition, were used for additional assessment of baseline cognition. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Geriatric Depression Scale.\nResults confirmed our hypothesis that both NE and openness contribute to prediction of cognitive change beyond baseline cognition and depressive symptoms, but none of the covariates (i.e., depression, executive functions, processing efficiency, or memory) themselves contributed to the model. NE and openness each contributed unique variance and were independent of each other.\nOpenness and NE have the potential to provide evidence-based methods for estimating risk of future cognitive change in persons with currently normal standardized test scores.", "Rural healthcare resource limitations can affect the choices people make and their quality of life during its end stages. In rural regions of Australia, district nurses (DNs) working in generalist community roles provide access to care by visiting people in their homes. They may be well positioned to improve the quality of the end-of-life experience by advocating for choice and person-centred end-of-life goals; however, knowledge about care in this context is limited. Initial findings from an exploratory qualitative study describing how rural DNs are able to successfully advocate for the end-of-life choices and goals of people living at home need to be confirmed and further developed to inform clinical practice. This survey aimed to test and complement the findings from a narrative exploration of how DNs advocate successfully for the end-of-life goals of rural Australians.\nA sequential mixed methods study based on a pragmatic design was used to explore how DNs advocate successfully for the end-of-life goals of rural Australians. In the first phase of the study two stages of reflection on experience by rural DNs from the state of Victoria (N=7) provided written and in-depth narrative understandings of how advocacy is enabled and actioned in the practice context. The data were analysed with interpretive description, resulting in findings that could be used to inform a survey for the second phase. The survey, reported here, was designed as an online questionnaire to be distributed by email across inner and outer regional Australia. It was trialled by rural health professionals (N=13) and modified according to the advice received. The participation criteria for the survey specified registered nurses working in generalist community nursing roles with experience in providing successful end-of-life advocacy for people at home. Scales were used to test and complement the phase 1 findings and analysed using Cronbach's alpha and descriptive statistics, with a 95% confidence interval calculated. Open-ended questions added to complement the understanding of how successful advocacy is enabled and actioned in this context were analysed with descriptive interpretation.\nA self-selecting sample of nurses (N=91) responded to the survey between March and July 2015. The response came from most Australian states and territories, and confirmed the findings that willing nursing involvement in end-of-life experiences, specialised rural relational knowledge, and feeling supported, together enable nurses to advocate successfully for person-centred goals. Actions based on advocacy that were highly rated for success include holistic assessment, effective end-of-life communication and the organisation of empowering and supportive care, confirming the phase 1 findings. High levels of emotional intelligence, understandings of 'going beyond duty', the types of support used and the need for advocacy for resources were reported.\nThe results provide both confirmatory and new knowledge that can be used with confidence to inform practice with a model for rural end-of-life nursing advocacy in the home setting.", "Chronic pain (CP) is linked to changes in cognitive function. However, little is known about its influence on number sense, despite the fact that intact numerical-spatial processing is a prerequisite for valid scale-based pain assessments. This study aimed to elucidate whether number sense is changed in CP, to determine if changes have an impact on pain assessments using pain rating scales and what patient factors might contribute. N = 42 CP patients and n = 42 matched controls were analyzed (age range: 33-68 years). Numerical-spatial abilities were investigated by using number line tasks, where participants either estimated the position of a given number (position marking) or the value of a predefined mark (number naming). Pain intensity was assessed using numerical rating (NRS), verbal rating (VRS), and visual analog (VAS) scales. Additional measures included attention and working memory, verbal intelligence, medication and depression. Results revealed that in number naming, patients deviated more from expected (correct) responses than controls, and that VAS scores were significantly higher than both NRS and VRS and correlated with deviations in position making. Changes in number naming were predicted by pain intensity, sex and IQ but not by attention, memory or opioid medication. This article presents new insight on which cognitive mechanisms are influenced by CP with the focus on numerical spatial abilities. It could therefore provide useful knowledge in developing new pain assessment tools specifically for patients suffering from CP.", "In recent decades, artificial intelligence and machine learning have played a significant role in increasing the efficiency of processes across a wide spectrum of industries. When it comes to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors, numerous tools enabled by advancement of computer science have been developed and are now routinely utilized. However, there are many aspects of the drug discovery process, which can further benefit from refinement of computational methods and tools, as well as improvement of accessibility of these new technologies. In this review, examples of recent developments in machine learning application are described, which have the potential to impact different parts of the drug discovery and development flow scheme. Notably, new deep learning-based approaches across compound design and synthesis, prediction of binding, activity and ADMET properties, as well as applications of genetic algorithms are highlighted.", "Toxicity prediction is very important to public health. Among its many applications, toxicity prediction is essential to reduce the cost and labor of a drug's preclinical and clinical trials, because a lot of drug evaluations (cellular, animal, and clinical) can be spared due to the predicted toxicity. In the era of Big Data and artificial intelligence, toxicity prediction can benefit from machine learning, which has been widely used in many fields such as natural language processing, speech recognition, image recognition, computational chemistry, and bioinformatics, with excellent performance. In this article, we review machine learning methods that have been applied to toxicity prediction, including deep learning, random forests, k-nearest neighbors, and support vector machines. We also discuss the input parameter to the machine learning algorithm, especially its shift from chemical structural description only to that combined with human transcriptome data analysis, which can greatly enhance prediction accuracy.", "It is believed that genetic factors play a large role in the development of many cognitive and neurological processes; however, epidemiological evidence for the genetic basis of childhood neurodevelopment is very limited. Identification of the genetic polymorphisms associated with early-stage neurodevelopment will help elucidate biological mechanisms involved in neuro-behavior and provide a better understanding of the developing brain. To search for such variants, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for infant mental and motor ability at two years of age with mothers and children recruited from cohorts in Bangladesh and Mexico. Infant ability was assessed using mental and motor composite scores calculated with country-specific versions of the Bayley Scales of Infant Development. A missense variant (rs1055153) located in the gene WWTR1 reached genome-wide significance in association with mental composite score (meta-analysis effect size of minor allele \u03b2meta\u2009=\u2009-6.04; 95% CI: -8.13 to -3.94; P\u2009=\u20091.56\u00d710-8). Infants carrying the minor allele reported substantially lower cognitive scores in both cohorts, and this variant is predicted to be in the top 0.3% of most deleterious substitutions in the human genome. Fine mapping and region-based association testing provided additional suggestive evidence that both WWTR1 and a second gene, LRP1B, were associated with infant cognitive ability. Comparisons with recently conducted GWAS in intelligence and educational attainment indicate that our phenotypes do not possess a high genetic correlation with either adolescent or adult cognitive traits, suggesting that infant neurological assessments should be treated as an independent outcome of interest. Additional functional studies and replication efforts in other cohorts may help uncover new biological pathways and genetic architectures that are crucial to the developing brain.", "Pathogenic disruptions to the activity-dependent neuroprotector homeobox (ADNP) gene are among the most common heterozygous genetic mutations associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). Individuals with ADNP disruptions share a constellation of medical and psychiatric features, including ASD, intellectual disability (ID), dysmorphic features, and hypotonia. However, the profile of ASD symptoms associated with ADNP may differ from that of individuals with another ASD-associated single gene disruption or with ASD without a known genetic cause. The current study examined the ASD phenotype in a sample of representative youth with ADNP disruptions. Participants (N = 116, ages 4-22 years) included a cohort with ADNP mutations (n = 11) and three comparison groups with either a mutation to CHD8 (n = 11), a mutation to another ASD-associated gene (other mutation; n = 53), or ASD with no known genetic etiology (idiopathic ASD; n = 41). As expected, individuals with ADNP disruptions had higher rates of ID but less severe social affect symptoms compared to the CHD8 and Idiopathic ASD groups. In addition, verbal intelligence explained more variance in social impairment in the ADNP group compared to CHD8, other mutation, and idiopathic ASD comparison groups. Restricted and repetitive behaviors in the ADNP group were characterized by high levels of stereotyped motor behaviors, whereas the idiopathic ASD group showed high levels of restricted interests. Taken together, these results underscore the role of ADNP in cognitive functioning and suggest that social impairments in ADNP syndrome are consistent with severity of verbal deficits. Autism Res 2018, 11: 1300-1310. \u00a9 2018 International Society for Autism Research, Wiley Periodicals, Inc. LAY SUMMARY: Disruptions to the ADNP gene (i.e., ADNP syndrome) have been associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). This article describes intellectual disability, mild social difficulties, and severe repetitive motor movements in a group of 11 youth with ADNP Syndrome. We found lower rates of ASD than previously reported. Verbal skills explained individual variability in social impairment. This pattern suggests that the ADNP gene is primarily associated with learning and memory, and level of social difficulties is consistent with level of verbal impairment.", "Over the last few years, the uses of artificial intelligence techniques (AI) for modeling daily reference evapotranspiration (ET0) have become more popular and a considerable amount of models were successfully applied to the problem. Therefore, in the present paper, we propose a new evolving connectionist (ECoS) approaches for modeling daily reference evapotranspiration (ET0) in the Mediterranean region of Algeria. Three ECoS models, namely, (i) the off-line dynamic evolving neural-fuzzy inference system called DEFNIS_OF, (ii) the on-line dynamic evolving neural-fuzzy inference system called DEFNIS_ON, and (iii) the evolving fuzzy neural network called (EFuNN), were statistically compared using the root mean square error (RMSE), the mean absolute error (MAE), the coefficient of correlation (R), and the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) indexes. The proposed approaches were applied for modeling daily ET0 using climatic variables from two weather stations: Algiers and Skikda, Algeria. Five well-known climatic variables were selected as inputs: daily maximum and minimum air temperatures (Tmax and Tmin), daily wind speed (WS), daily relative humidity (RH), and daily sunshine hours (SH). The effect of combining several climatic variables as inputs was evaluated, and at least six scenarios were developed and compared. The proposed ECoS models were compared against the reference Penman-Monteith model referred as \"FAO-56 PM\". According to the results obtained, the DEFNIS_OF1 model having Tmax, Tmin, WS, RH, and SH as inputs, is the best model, followed by the DEFNIS_ON1, and the EFuNN1 is the worst model. The R and NSE value calculated for the testing dataset for the Algiers and Skikda stations were (0.954, 0.910) and (0.954, 0.905), respectively. While both DEFNIS_OF1 and DEFNIS_ON1 showed good accuracy and high performances, the EFuNN1 was less accurate.", "Novel developments in bioinformation, bioinformatics and biostatistics, including artificial intelligence (AI), play a timely and critical role in translational care. Case in point, the extent to which viral immune surveillance is regulated by immune cells and soluble factors, and by non-immune factors informs the administration of health care. The events by which health is regained following viral infection is an allostatic process, which can be modeled using Hilbert's and Volterra's mathematical biology criteria, and biostatistical methodologies such as linear multiple regression. Health regained following viral infection can be given as Y being the sum-total of the positive factors and events (\u220f) that inherently push allostasis forward (i.e., the orderly process of immune activation and maturation) and the negative (N) factors and events that, allostatically speaking, interfere with regaining health. Any gaps in knowledge are filled by AI-aided immune tweening. Proof of concept can be tested with the fast-gaining infection using tick-borne Bunyavirus that cause severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS).", "Recent advances of neuroimaging methodology and artificial intelligence have resulted in renewed interest in board games like chess and Baduk (called Go game in the West) and have provided clues as to the mechanisms behind the games. However, an interesting question that remains to be answered is whether the board game expertise as one of cognitive skills goes beyond just being good at the trained game and how it maps on networks associated with cognitive abilities that are not directly trained. To address this issue, we examined functional activity and connectivity in Baduk experts, compared to novices, while performing a visual n-back working memory (WM) task. We found that experts, compared to novices, had greater activation in superior parietal cortex during face WM, though there were no group differences in behavioral performances. Using a data-driven, whole-brain multivariate approach, we also found significant group differences in the multivariate pattern of connectivity in frontal pole and inferior parietal cortex, further showing greater connectivity between frontal and parietal regions and between frontal and temporal regions in experts. Our findings suggest that long-term trained Baduk experts have the reorganization of functional interactions between brain regions even for untrained cognitive ability.", "Interest in research involving health-medical information analysis based on artificial intelligence, especially for deep learning techniques, has recently been increasing. Most of the research in this field has been focused on searching for new knowledge for predicting and diagnosing disease by revealing the relation between disease and various information features of data. These features are extracted by analyzing various clinical pathology data, such as EHR (electronic health records), and academic literature using the techniques of data analysis, natural language processing, etc. However, still needed are more research and interest in applying the latest advanced artificial intelligence-based data analysis technique to bio-signal data, which are continuous physiological records, such as EEG (electroencephalography) and ECG (electrocardiogram). Unlike the other types of data, applying deep learning to bio-signal data, which is in the form of time series of real numbers, has many issues that need to be resolved in preprocessing, learning, and analysis. Such issues include leaving feature selection, learning parts that are black boxes, difficulties in recognizing and identifying effective features, high computational complexities, etc. In this paper, to solve these issues, we provide an encoding-based Wave2vec time series classifier model, which combines signal-processing and deep learning-based natural language processing techniques. To demonstrate its advantages, we provide the results of three experiments conducted with EEG data of the University of California Irvine, which are a real-world benchmark bio-signal dataset. After converting the bio-signals (in the form of waves), which are a real number time series, into a sequence of symbols or a sequence of wavelet patterns that are converted into symbols, through encoding, the proposed model vectorizes the symbols by learning the sequence using deep learning-based natural language processing. The models of each class can be constructed through learning from the vectorized wavelet patterns and training data. The implemented models can be used for prediction and diagnosis of diseases by classifying the new data. The proposed method enhanced data readability and intuition of feature selection and learning processes by converting the time series of real number data into sequences of symbols. In addition, it facilitates intuitive and easy recognition, and identification of influential patterns. Furthermore, real-time large-capacity data analysis is facilitated, which is essential in the development of real-time analysis diagnosis systems, by drastically reducing the complexity of calculation without deterioration of analysis performance by data simplification through the encoding process.", "Can dreams reveal insight into our cognitive abilities and aptitudes (i.e., \"human intelligence\")? The relationship between dream production and trait-like cognitive abilities is the foundation of several long-standing theories on the neurocognitive and cognitive-psychological basis of dreaming. However, direct experimental evidence is sparse and remains contentious. On the other hand, recent research has provided compelling evidence demonstrating a link between dream content and new learning, suggesting that dreams reflect memory processing during sleep. It remains to be investigated whether the extent of learning-related dream incorporation (i.e., the semantic similarity between waking experiences and dream content) is related to inter-individual differences in cognitive abilities. The relationship between pre-post sleep memory performance improvements and learning-related dream incorporation was investigated (N = 24) to determine if this relationship could be explained by inter-individual differences in intellectual abilities (e.g., reasoning, short term memory (STM), and verbal abilities). The extent of dream incorporation using a novel and objective method of dream content analysis, employed a computational linguistic approach to measure the semantic relatedness between verbal reports describing the experience on a spatial (e.g., maze navigation) or a motor memory task (e.g., tennis simulator) with subsequent hypnagogic reverie dream reports and waking \"daydream\" reports, obtained during a daytime nap opportunity. Consistent with previous studies, the extent to which something new was learned was related (r = 0.47) to how richly these novel experiences were incorporated into the content of dreams. This was significant for early (the first 4 dream reports) but not late dreams (the last 4 dream reports). Notably, here, we show for the first time that the extent of this incorporation for early dreams was related (r = 0.41) to inter-individual differences in reasoning abilities. On the other hand, late dream incorporation was related (r = 0.46) to inter-individual differences in verbal abilities. There was no relationship between performance improvements and intellectual abilities, and thus, inter-individual differences in cognitive abilities did not mediate the relationship between performance improvements and dream incorporation; suggesting a direct relationship between reasoning abilities and dream incorporation. This study provides the first evidence that learning-related dream production is related to inter-individual differences in cognitive abilities.", "Numerous studies reported a positive relationship between speed of information processing (SIP) and the g factor of intelligence. Only very few studies, however, examined SI P's relationship to speed-, capacity-, and memory-related aspects of psychometric intelligence. In order to further elucidate this relationship, a Hick reaction time task and the Berlin Intelligence Structure (BIS) test were administered to 240 participants. From the BIS test, indicators of BIS -Capacity, BIS -Speed, and BIS -Memory were determined. By means of fixed-links modeling, we subdivided variance in reaction time from the Hick task into a component representing individual differences in speed directly related to the systematically increased number of possible responses and another component representing individual differences in speed associated with residual sources unrelated to the experimental variation of response alternatives. While the former speed component was primarily related to BIS -Capacity and, to a lesser extent, to BIS -Speed, the latter one was only weakly related to BIS -Speed but unrelated to BIS -Capacity. None of the two speed components from the Hick task showed an association with BIS -Memory. Our findings indicate that individual differences in SI P caused by experimentally increasing the number of possible responses were more strongly associated with capacity- than with speed-related aspects of psychometric intelligence. In addition, individual differences in SI P not associated with the experimental manipulation of response alternatives showed rather weak relationships to each of the three BIS operations and could be considered equally strong.", "In the Republic of Korea, one of the most widely discussed subjects related to future logistics technology is the drone-based delivery (transportation) system. Much (around 75%) of Korea's territory consists of mountainous areas; however, the costs of installing internet facilities for drone landing sites are very high compared to other countries. Therefore, this paper proposes the power-line communication (PLC) system introduced in the author's previous study as an alternative solution. For the system design, a number of lightning rods are used together with a monitoring system. The system algorithm performs substantial data analysis. Also, as the author found that instantaneous high-voltage currents were a major cause of fire incidents, a three-phase three-wire connection was used for the installation of the lightning rods (Bipolar Conventional Air Terminal). Thus, based on the PLC technology, an artificial intelligence (AI) which avoids lightning strikes at the drone landing site by interworking with a closed-circuit television (CCTV) monitoring system when a drone flies over the mountain regions is proposed in this paper. The algorithm was implemented with C++ and Unity/C#, whereas the application for the part concerning the integrated sensing was developed with Java Android.", "The manufacture of humanoid robots with embedded artificial intelligence and for sexual purposes\u00a0has generated some debates within bioethics, in which diverse competing views have been presented. Themes such as sexuality and its deviations, the objectification of women, the relational problems of contemporary life, loneliness, and even the reproductive future of the species constitute the arguments which have emerged in relation to this subject. Based on these themes, this article presents the current state of the use of female sex robots, the bioethical problems that arise, and how bioethics could serve as a medium for both thinking about and resolving some of these challenges.", "Evidence indicates that diet, nutrition, lifestyle, the environment, the microbiome, and other exogenous factors have pathogenic roles and also influence the genome, epigenome, transcriptome, proteome, and metabolome of tumor and nonneoplastic cells, including immune cells. With the need for big-data research, pathology must transform to integrate data science fields, including epidemiology, biostatistics, and bioinformatics. The research framework of molecular pathological epidemiology (MPE) demonstrates the strengths of such an interdisciplinary integration, having been used to study breast, lung, prostate, and colorectal cancers. The MPE research paradigm not only can provide novel insights into interactions among environment, tumor, and host but also opens new research frontiers. New developments-such as computational digital pathology, systems biology, artificial intelligence, and in vivo pathology technologies-will further transform pathology and MPE. Although it is necessary to address the rarity of transdisciplinary education and training programs, MPE provides an exemplary model of integrative scientific approaches and contributes to advancements in precision medicine, therapy, and prevention.", "The genetic and environmental influences on prefrontal function in childhood are underinvestigated due to the difficulty of measuring prefrontal function in young subjects, for which near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a suitable functional neuroimaging technique that facilitates the easy and noninvasive measurement of blood oxygenation in the superficial cerebral cortices.\nUsing a two-channel NIRS arrangement, we measured changes in bilateral prefrontal blood oxygenation during a category version of the verbal fluency task (VFT) in 27 monozygotic twin pairs and 12 same-sex dizygotic twin pairs ages 5-17\u00a0years. We also assessed the participant's full-scale intelligence quotient (FIQ) and retrieved parental socioeconomic status (SES). Classical structured equation modeling was used to estimate the heritability.\nThe heritability of VFT-related brain activation was estimated to be 44% and 37% in the right and left prefrontal regions, respectively. We also identified a significant genetic contribution (74%) to FIQ, but did not to VFT task performance. Parental SES was not correlated with FIQ, task performance, or task-related prefrontal activation.\nThis finding provides further evidence that variance in prefrontal function has a genetic component since childhood and highlights brain function, as measured by NIRS, as a promising candidate for endophenotyping neurodevelopmental disorders.", "Intelligence analysis is a necessary operation for organizations engaged in adversarial decision making in military, criminal justice, and civil spheres. In particular, we focus on studying the sentiment of actors in a military-relevant decision-making task and how information pertaining to these actors is presented.\nTwo intelligence analysis systems were created to represent sentiment data.\nThese systems and another with the raw information (i.e., the control condition) were presented to experimental participants in separate trials with the pretext that they act as intelligence analysts and compare two social media actors in U.S.-occupied territory on given subject matters.\nResults demonstrated that cognitive processing of the information improved and was preferred for the prototype that presented information in scatterplot form rather than a line graph, though side-by-side comparisons also were preferred from the disfavored system.\nWe conclude with suggestions for designing intelligence analysis software that conforms to best practice in human factors with a focus on cognitive processing.\nWe hope these recommendations will improve intelligence analysis of sentiment information via a new system.", "This study investigated the role of intelligence and its development across childhood in decision-making in adolescence (age 11\u00a0years). The sample was 12,514 children from the UK's Millennium Cohort Study, followed at ages 3, 5, 7, and 11\u00a0years. Decision-making (risk-taking, quality of decision-making, risk adjustment, deliberation time, and delay aversion) was measured with the Cambridge Gambling Task. Even after adjustment for confounding, intelligence was positively associated with risk adjustment and quality of decision-making in both boys and girls. Furthermore, in girls risk adjustment was related positively to IQ gains. Our findings suggest that there are important, substantively, associations between intelligence and adapting behaviour to risk at the cusp of adolescence, the period when the response to risk can shape life trajectories. Statement of Contribution What is already known on this subject In children, intelligence and decision-making, measured with gambling tasks, are inconsistently linked. This could be due to gambling tasks not separating risk-taking from contingency-learning. What the present study adds This study measured 11-year-olds' decision-making using a gambling task in which probabilities of different outcomes are presented explicitly. IQ was positively associated with risk adjustment and quality of decision-making. Also significant were IQ gains (for risk adjustment, only in girls). There are links between intelligence and adapting behaviour to statistical risk in children.", "Benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (BECTS), also known as rolandic epilepsy, has recently been reported to be associated with variable degrees of cognitive dysfunction. Many studies reported poor language ability in children with BECTS compared with healthy control children. To elucidate the harmful effects of BECTS on language cognition, we studied the magnetoencephalographic activity elicited by an auditory language comprehension task.\nThe participants (N\u202f=\u202f20) included 10 children diagnosed with BECTS (aged 10.8\u202f\u00b1\u202f2.8\u202fyears) and 10 age-matched healthy children (control) (aged 10.6\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.6\u202fyears). Cognitive function was assessed using general intellectual function and language ability. In patients with BECTS, we reviewed the clinical course and electroencephalogram (EEG) findings. We recorded the cortical responses elicited by an auditory language comprehension task using magnetoencephalography (MEG). We compared those results between groups and analyzed the correlation with cognitive scores and frequency of spikes.\nThe full-scale intelligence quotient (FSIQ) by the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-4th edition was significantly reduced in the group with BECTS (96.4\u202f\u00b1\u202f12.3) compared with the control group (110.0\u202f\u00b1\u202f7.4). In half of the group with BECTS, the auditory comprehension score fell below the age-standard level. In the group with BECTS, the cortical activation during the task showed reduced intensity in language-associated areas such as the bilateral primary auditory cortex, left superior and mid-temporal areas, and inferior frontal area compared with those in the control group. In addition, the cortical activation in the left superior temporal area was negatively correlated with spike frequency and positively correlated with FSIQ in the group with BECTS. Conversely, the right inferior frontal and mid-temporal areas had increased the activations in the group with BECTS. From the time frequency analysis, low gamma band event-related desynchronization was reduced in the group with BECTS.\nEpileptic spikes negatively influenced responsiveness to the auditory language comprehension task in the language-associated cortices. These findings suggest that epileptic spikes could have a negative impact on the functional activity in rolandic areas and become a reason to change the functional development of the language network.", "Individual people differ in their ability to reason, solve problems, think abstractly, plan and learn. A reliable measure of this general ability, also known as intelligence, can be derived from scores across a diverse set of cognitive tasks. There is great interest in understanding the neural underpinnings of individual differences in intelligence, because it is the single best predictor of long-term life success. The most replicated neural correlate of human intelligence to date is total brain volume; however, this coarse morphometric correlate says little about function. Here, we ask whether measurements of the activity of the resting brain (resting-state fMRI) might also carry information about intelligence. We used the final release of the Young Adult Human Connectome Project (N = 884 subjects after exclusions), providing a full hour of resting-state fMRI per subject; controlled for gender, age and brain volume; and derived a reliable estimate of general intelligence from scores on multiple cognitive tasks. Using a cross-validated predictive framework, we predicted 20% of the variance in general intelligence in the sampled population from their resting-state connectivity matrices. Interestingly, no single anatomical structure or network was responsible or necessary for this prediction, which instead relied on redundant information distributed across the brain.This article is part of the theme issue 'Causes and consequences of individual differences in cognitive abilities'.", "Disruption of the cholinergic neurotransmitter pathway which is important for cognition, memory and learning abilities has been reported in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) patients. The receptors involved include the Cholinergic Receptors Muscarinic (CHRM). CHRM2 gene has been associated with intelligence, personality traits, substance dependence and depression. CHRM3 has been found to heterodimerize with CHRM2.\nDNA samples from 240 AD patients with SNPs rs6962027 of CHRM2 gene and rs7511970 of CHRM3 gene were amplified using PCR and genotyped using Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP). Chi-squared test was done to check if the genes are in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.\nAlthough the results did not show significant associations, these data denote plausible interaction between TT in SNP rs6962027 in CHRM2 gene and TT in SNP rs7511970 in CHRM3 gene affecting AD risk. SNP rs7511970 of CHRM3 gene may also exert an influence on late-onset AD.", "There are clear benefits from genomics and health data sharing in research and in therapy for individuals across societies. At the same time, citizens have different expectations and fears about that data sharing. International legislation in relation with research ethics and practice and, particularly, data protection create a particular environment that, as is seen in the articles in part two of this special issue, are crying out for harmonisation both at a procedural but at fundamental conceptual levels. The law of data sharing is pulling in different directions. This paper poses the question, 'harmonisation, an impossible dream?' and the answer is a qualified 'no'. The paper reflects on what can be seen in the papers in part two of the special issue. It then identifies three major areas of conceptual uncertainty in the new EU General Data Protection Regulation (not because it has superiority over other jurisdictions, but because it is a recent revision of data protection law that leaves universal conceptual questions unclear). Thereafter, the potential for Artificial Intelligence to meet some of the shortcomings is discussed. The paper ends with a consideration of the conditions under which data sharing harmonisation might be achieved: an understanding of a human rights approach and citizen sensitivities in considering the 'public interest'; social liberalism as a basis of solidarity; and the profession of 'researcher'.", "Incremental implicit theories are associated with a belief regarding it is possible to improve one's intelligence or ability through efforts. Previous studies have demonstrated that incremental implicit theories contributed to better academic achievement and positive youth development. Our study aimed to examine whether incremental implicit theories of morality significantly influenced change in students' engagement in voluntary service activities. In our study, 54 Korean college students for Study 1 and 180 Korean 8th graders for Study 2 were recruited to conduct two two-wave studies. We surveyed participants' implicit theories of morality and participation in voluntary service activities. The effect of implicit theories of morality on change in service engagement was analyzed through regression analysis. In Study 1, the moral growth mindset significantly moderated longitudinal change in service engagement. In Study 2, the moral growth mindset significantly influenced engagement in art-related activities, while it significantly moderated change in engagement in youth-related activities.", "Intestinal parasites are a cause of morbidity and mortality throughout the world particularly in developing countries and they are common health problems of children. This study determined the prevalence of intestinal parasites among primary school children, assessed risk factors predisposing to infection and the nutritional status with cognitive function of the pupils.\nIt was a cross sectional study and 384 pupils from six public primary schools in Ile-Ife were enrolled. Anthropometric measurements were obtained using standard procedures. The intelligence quotients of the pupils were assessed using the Draw-a-person- test. Stool samples were collected and examined. Data was processed using SPSS Inc USA version 17. Statistical analysis was done using frequency, percentages, tables and Pearson's chi-square was used to determine the association between intestinal parasites, nutritional status and cognitive function.\nThe prevalence of intestinal parasites in the study population was 24% with double infection occurring in 3.2%. Ascaris lumbricoides most prevalent 22.1%, Hookworm 3.4%, Hymenolepis nana 0.3%. Intestinal parasites were present in those that use bush and refuse dump for defeacation. The nutritional status of the pupils showed 95.8% normal weight, 3.6% underweight and 0.5% overweight. In terms of cognition, 65.4% mentally deficient, 14.3% mentally dull and 20.3% average.\nIntestinal parasites were prevalent among primary school children and use of bush or refuse dump for defeacation was a risk factor. There was no association between intestinal parasites, nutritional status and cognition.", "It has recently been suggested that the other race effect (ORE), whereby own race faces are recognised better than those of other races, can be abolished by bilingualism.Bilingualism, however, is not a categorical variable but can vary dramatically in proficiency across the two languages. We therefore hypothesised that increasing bilingual proficiency should be associated with a diminishing ORE. To test this, we asked a group of bilingual Singaporean Chinese individuals to complete the Asian and Caucasian Cambridge Face Memory Tests. In contrast to recent work, our bilinguals did as a group exhibit an ORE, however, the magnitude of this effect decreased as reported cross-language proficiency increased; Chinese, rather than English, listening ability drove this association. This relationship persisted even when taking into account our participants' exposure to Caucasians, own race memory ability, age, and gender. Moreover, we discounted the possibility that bilingualism merely reflected participants' underlying intelligence. Increasing auditory bilingualism thus diminishes perceptual narrowing for faces. We propose that other race recognition ability reflects the base level of intrinsic, domain specific face memory, whereas the distance in recognition performance between own and other race faces is comprised of a domain general process related to stimulus individuation. Finally, our results have serious implications for how we can interpret prior research investigating the ORE, and culture's influence on visual perception, due to the confounding influence of bilingualism.", "Initial participants were 79 children who were recruited from six preschool programs in the U.S. Full assessment data was available for 73 children (average age of 4 years 7 months), including demographic data (gender, ethnicity, financial need, language(s) spoken at home and special education status). Children\u05f3s math, repeating patterning, spatial and verbal skills were assessed at the beginning of the pre-kindergarten year. Assessments included the brief version of the Research-Based Early Mathematics Assessment, two measures of repeating patterning skills, three measures of spatial skills (the Block Design subtest of the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence, the Position in Space subtest of the Developmental Test of Visual Perception, and a Corsi Block Tapping Task), the Picture Vocabulary Test from the NIH Toolbox app and a backward letter span task. Near the end of the school year, their math knowledge was re-assessed using the same math measure, as was their memory span (forward and backward digit span task from the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children). Findings on the relations between patterning, spatial and math skills are published elsewhere (Rittle-Johnson et al., 2018) [1].", "Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are advanced artificial intelligence algorithms well suited to image classification tasks with variable features. These have been used to great effect in various real-world applications including handwriting recognition, face detection, image search, and fraud prevention. We sought to retrain a robust CNN with coronal computed tomography (CT) images to classify osteomeatal complex (OMC) occlusion and assess the performance of this technology with rhinologic data.\nThe Google Inception-V3 CNN trained with 1.28 million images was used as the base model. Preoperative coronal sections through the OMC were obtained from 239 patients enrolled in 2 prospective chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) outcomes studies, labeled according to OMC status, and mirrored to obtain a set of 956 images. Using this data, the classification layer of Inception-V3 was retrained in Python using a transfer learning method to adapt the CNN to the task of interpreting sinonasal CT images.\nThe retrained neural network achieved 85% classification accuracy for OMC occlusion, with a 95% confidence interval for algorithm accuracy of 78% to 92%. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis on the test set confirmed good classification ability of the CNN with an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.87, significantly different than both random guessing and a dominant classifier that predicts the most common class (p < 0.0001).\nCurrent state-of-the-art CNNs may be able to learn clinically relevant information from 2-dimensional sinonasal CT images with minimal supervision. Future work will extend this approach to 3-dimensional images in order to further refine this technology for possible clinical applications.", "Intelligence, as measured by standardised tests of cognitive function, such as IQ-type tests, is predictive of psychiatric diagnosis and psychological wellbeing. Using genome-wide association study (GWAS) data, a measure of the shared genetic effect across traits, can be quantified; because this can be done across samples, the confounding effects of psychiatric diagnosis do not influence the magnitude of these relationships. It is now known that there are genetic effects that act across intelligence and psychiatric diagnoses, which provide a partial explanation for the phenotypic link between intelligence and mental health. Potential causal effects between intelligence and mental health have been identified, and the regions of the genome responsible for some of these cross trait associations have begun to be characterised.", "The literature on the relationship between handedness and cognitive ability is riddled with studies using different conceptualizations of handedness (e.g., hand preference vs hand skill, direction vs degree, consistency vs inconsistency) and different conceptualizations of cognitive ability (intelligence vs distinct abilities), as well as different measurements thereof. Recently the literature was summarized by means of meta-analytic techniques. The findings show quite robustly that when handedness is assessed as hand preference and individuals are classified according to direction (i.e., as left-handers vs right-handers), no differences in cognitive ability emerge between handedness groups. However, other evidence points to the importance of assessing degree rather than direction of handedness and of employing hand skill rather than hand preference measures. A meta-analysis of such studies has not been possible to date, due to their scarcity. It is here suggested that degree of handedness and hand skill measures are employed in future studies exploring the possible relationship between handedness and cognitive ability so as to elaborate whether or not such a relationship exists and if so, what its characteristics are.", "Psychiatric disorders are ubiquitous and affect not only adults but also children and adolescents. The age factor plays an important role in the pattern of these psychiatric disorders. The objective of our study was to find the pattern of psychiatric morbidity in children and adolescents at the child and adolescent outpatient service of a tertiary care hospital.\nA semi-structured questionnaire was used to record the sociodemographic status. The state of mental health and psychiatric morbidity was assessed after a thorough clinical assessment. Intelligence quotient was assessed by a clinical psychologist as and when needed. All the diagnoses were made on the basis of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition, Text Revision criteria.\nA total of 529 patients were included. Most patients belonged to the age group of 6-16 years (70.5%). Boys (67.9%) outnumbered girls. Most of the patients were from rural background (56.7%) and from nuclear families (53%). Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (31%) and mental retardation (29%) were the most frequent diagnoses, followed by pervasive developmental disorders (10%). Comorbidity was present in about 18% of our patients.\nThe child psychiatry is gaining acceptance, and children and adolescents with minor mental health issues are being identified and referred for specialized services.", "Earlier studies report inconsistent associations between education and cognitive aging. We assessed the association, accounting for selective dropout due to death or dementia, and, in a subsample, accounting for confounding by early-life intelligence. Data from the Danish component of the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (n = 3,400) were linked to registry data (education records, dementia diagnoses, and mortality) and the Danish Conscription Database (youth intelligence measurements for 854 men). Word recall and verbal fluency were assessed up to 4 times over 10 years (2004-2013) and combined by averaging the z scores. We fitted a joint model linking a time-to-event model for dementia or death to a linear mixed-effects model for cognitive change. Rate of cognitive decline was slower among people with high education compared with low education (\u03b2 = 0.112, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.056, 0.170). Adjusting for youth intelligence did not attenuate the association between education and cognitive decline (crude \u03b2 = 0.136, 95% CI: 0.028, 0.244 vs. adjusted \u03b2 = 0.145, 95% CI: 0.022, 0.269). The results suggest that higher education may slow cognitive decline in later life. In this sample, results changed little when accounting for selective attrition and confounding by intelligence.", "Surgery or multiple procedural interventions in extremely preterm neonates influence neurodevelopmental outcome and may be associated with long-term changes in somatosensory function or pain response.\nThis observational study recruited extremely preterm (EP, <26 weeks' gestation; n=102, 60% female) and term-born controls (TC; n=48) aged 18-20 yr from the UK EPICure cohort. Thirty EP but no TC participants had neonatal surgery. Evaluation included: quantitative sensory testing (thenar eminence, chest wall); clinical pain history; questionnaires (intelligence quotient; pain catastrophising; anxiety); and structural brain imaging.\nReduced thermal threshold sensitivity in EP vs TC participants persisted at age 18-20 yr. Sex-dependent effects varied with stimulus intensity and were enhanced by neonatal surgery, with reduced threshold sensitivity in EP surgery males but increased sensitivity to prolonged noxious cold in EP surgery females (P<0.01). Sex-dependent differences in thermal sensitivity correlated with smaller amygdala volume (P<0.05) but not current intelligence quotient. While generalised decreased sensitivity encompassed mechanical and thermal modalities in EP surgery males, a mixed pattern of sensory loss and sensory gain persisted adjacent to neonatal scars in males and females. More EP participants reported moderate-severe recurrent pain (22/101 vs 4/48; \u03c72=0.04) and increased pain intensity correlated with higher anxiety and pain catastrophising.\nAfter preterm birth and neonatal surgery, different patterns of generalised and local scar-related alterations in somatosensory function persist into early adulthood. Sex-dependent changes in generalised sensitivity may reflect central modulation by affective circuits. Early life experience and sex/gender should be considered when evaluating somatosensory function, pain experience, or future chronic pain risk.", "Previous studies on the genetic basis of creativity have mainly focused on the biological mechanisms of divergent thinking, possibly limiting the exploration of possible candidate genes. Taking a cognition-based perspective, the present study investigated the genetic basis for both the divergent and the convergent thinking components of creativity. A total of 321 Chinese university students were recruited to complete the Guildford Unusual Using Test (UUT) for divergent thinking capability and the Remote Associates Test (RAT) for convergent thinking capability. The polymorphism of rs2576037 in KATNAL2 was related to the fluency and originality component scores of UUT, and the polymorphism of rs5993883 in COMT, rs362584 in SNAP25 was related to the RAT performance. These effects remained significant after considering the influence of age, gender and intelligence. Our results provide new evidence for the genetic basis of creativity and reveal the important role of gene polymorphisms in divergent and convergent thinking.", "The prevailing hypotheses for the evolution of cognition focus on either the demands associated with group living (the social intelligence hypothesis (SIH)) or ecological challenges such as finding food. Comparative studies testing these hypotheses have generated highly conflicting results; consequently, our understanding of the drivers of cognitive evolution remains limited. To understand how selection shapes cognition, research must incorporate an intraspecific approach, focusing on the causes and consequences of individual variation in cognition. Here, we review the findings of recent intraspecific cognitive research to investigate the predictions of the SIH. Extensive evidence from our own research on Australian magpies (Cracticus tibicen dorsalis), and a number of other taxa, suggests that individuals in larger social groups exhibit elevated cognitive performance and, in some cases, elevated reproductive fitness. Not only do these findings demonstrate how the social environment has the potential to shape cognitive evolution, but crucially, they demonstrate the importance of considering both genetic and developmental factors when attempting to explain the causes of cognitive variation.This article is part of the theme issue 'Causes and consequences of individual differences in cognitive abilities'.", "Studies of cognitive function in patients with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) are few and controversial. This study aimed to investigate general intelligence and specific cognitive functions in children with salt wasting (SW) form of CAH and their relationship to demographic, clinical, and laboratory variables. This study included 36 children with classic 21 hydroxylase deficiency SW type of CAH (males\u2009=\u200912; females\u2009=\u200924; mean age\u2009=\u200915.6\u2009\u00b1\u20092.3\u00a0years). Intelligence quotient (IQ) and cognition were assessed using Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children 3rd edition (WISC-III) and Stanford Binet Subsets Test version 4 (SBST4). Compared to controls, patients had lower mean full-scale (FS) IQ (P\u2009=\u20090.01) score, particularly performance IQ score (P\u2009=\u20090.001), and comprehension, pattern analysis, quantitation, bead memory, and memory for sentences of SBST4 (P\u2009=\u20090.05, P\u2009=\u20090.014, P\u2009=\u20090.001, P\u2009=\u20090.002, and P\u2009=\u20090.05, respectively). Lower IQ was observed in poorly controlled compared with well-controlled patients on medical treatment. Significant correlations were observed between FSIQ with age (r\u2009=\u2009-\u20090.810; P\u2009=\u20090.001), duration of treatment (r\u2009=\u2009-\u20090.887; P\u2009=\u20090.01), dose of glucocorticoids (r\u2009=\u2009-\u20090.463; P\u2009=\u20090.01), 17-OHP (r\u2009=\u2009-\u20090.543; P\u2009=\u20090.01) and testosterone (r\u2009=\u2009-\u20090.462; P\u2009=\u2009-\u20090.006) levels, and number of hyponatremic episodes (r\u2009=\u2009-\u20090.350; P\u2009=\u20090.05). In multivariate analysis, the independent risks of low FSIQ were the dose of glucocorticoids (OR\u2009=\u20091.14; 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.08-1.23, P\u2009=\u20090.0001), 17-OHP levels (OR\u2009=\u20092.25; 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.19-2.85, P\u2009=\u20090.01), and number of hyponatremic episodes (OR\u2009=\u20094.34; 95% CI\u2009=\u20092.05-5.15, P\u2009=\u20090.01).Conclusion: Patients with SW form of CAH may have lower IQ and cognitive deficits which may be related to the dose of glucocorticoids, androgen excess, and number of hyponatremic episodes. What is Known: \u2022 Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is a group of inherited impairment of cortisol biosynthesis. \u2022 Studies of cognitive function in patients with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) are few and controversial. What is New: \u2022 Children with CAH may have lower intelligent quotient (IQ) and cognitive deficits. \u2022 Early hyponatremic episodes, overtreatment with glucocorticoids, and high androgen levels may be possible causative factors for the cognitive deficits.", "Recent research (Erdodi et al., 2017) indicated that certain Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS-IV) Processing Speed Index (PSI)-based indices may have some utility as embedded validity indicators (EVIs) among a diagnostically diverse sample of neuropsychology referrals. Individuals with schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSD) are often evaluated in forensic contexts in which there is incentive to exaggerate deficits. Because individuals with SSD often have limitations in processing speed associated with their disorders, the current study sought to evaluate the false-positive (FP) rates of cutoffs identified by Erdodi et al. on WAIS-IV PSI-based EVIs among forensically committed psychiatric inpatients with SSD who had no known incentive to feign because of the nature of their legal commitments. In the current sample, the previously suggested cutoff scores on PSI-based EVIs resulted in FP rates ranging from 2% to 57% among schizophrenia spectrum patients, with unacceptable FP rates for most indices. In the current sample of SSD patients, WAIS-IV PSI-based EVIs that are calculated based on the relative performance between PSI subtests (as opposed to absolute performance on individual indices) demonstrated acceptable FP rates.

A variety of screening tools and neuropsychiatric batteries are used to quantify the magnitude and nature of this dysfunction. Our objective is to summarize the neurocognitive testing used, and determine what degree cognitive dysfunction is reported in CKD patients. All study designs published in English that contained participants who were either pre-dialysis patients, haemodialysis (HD) or peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients or renal transplant recipients were considered. Reported comparative non-CKD control data was also collected. All study designs were included. The search period encompassed articles from 1980 to May 2018. This review is registered with PROSPERO (CRD42018096568). Of the 1711 articles screened, 148 articles were relevant and used in the meta-analysis. Commonly used assessments were The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), The Modified Mini-Mental State Examination, the Trails Making Tests (TMT) forms A and B and components of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale: Digit Span and Digit Symbol. Means for all assessments were adjusted using a random effects model to account for the differences in variance. Adjusted mean MMSE scores were significantly lower for both pre-dialysis (26.08, n = 17 073) and HD (26.31, n = 3314) patients when compared to non-CKD controls (28.21, n = 5226). PD (58.01 s, n = 859) and HD (56.04 s, n = 2344) patients also took significantly longer to complete the Trails Making Task A than non-CKD controls (37.62 s, n = 4809). Patients with CKD, especially pre-dialysis and those requiring dialysis, are likely to exhibit impairments in cognition that can be identified with specific screening neuropsychological assessments.", "Leadership skills are embedded in the undergraduate nursing curriculum and are essential for post-registration nurses. One way to support the development of these skills is to use the action learning and critical action learning approaches, which can be implemented in both the academic environment and the clinical setting. The process of action learning promotes collaborative multidisciplinary working and affords time for reflection and professional development, in turn supporting the process of applying for revalidation. Developing a nursing workforce with a high level of emotional intelligence can support decision-making, resilience and build confidence. These qualities are crucial not only for delivering safe patient care and promoting innovation in quality improvement, but are essential for personal development and individual career progression.", "Understanding what factors contribute to NCLEX-RN success is critical to nursing programs. Emotional intelligence is one factor that warrants investigation.\nThe purpose of our study was to examine emotional intelligence, measured via the Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test 2.0, to 2 standardized measures of nursing student performance: the Kaplan Nursing Assessment Test (NAT) and NCLEX-RN success.\nA descriptive, cohort design with 2 data collections times points (n = 53) evaluated the contribution of emotional intelligence to NAT and to NCLEX-RN success, while controlling for age.\nEmotional intelligence global scores were significantly related to both NAT and NCLEX-RN. Understanding emotions branch was a significant predictor of NAT. Perceiving emotions and understanding emotions branches were both significant predictors of NCLEX-RN.\nResults suggest that enhancing nursing curriculum to include training in perceiving and understanding emotions may be beneficial in augmenting student success.", "Public sector organizations are increasingly interested in using data science and artificial intelligence capabilities to deliver policy and generate efficiencies in high-uncertainty environments. The long-term success of data science and artificial intelligence (AI) in the public sector relies on effectively embedding it into delivery solutions for policy implementation. However, governments cannot do this integration of AI into public service delivery on their own. The UK Government Industrial Strategy is clear that delivering on the AI grand challenge requires collaboration between universities and the public and private sectors. This cross-sectoral collaborative approach is the norm in applied AI centres of excellence around the world. Despite their popularity, cross-sector collaborations entail serious management challenges that hinder their success. In this article we discuss the opportunities for and challenges of AI for the public sector. Finally, we propose a series of strategies to successfully manage these cross-sectoral collaborations.This article is part of a discussion meeting issue 'The growing ubiquity of algorithms in society: implications, impacts and innovations'.", "The National Echocardiography Database Australia (NEDA) is a new echocardiography database collecting digital measurements on both a retrospective and prospective basis.

Because of recent developments in artificial intelligence and robotics, robots are increasingly found in human environments, and there, they form a novel social presence. It is as yet unclear whether and to what extent these social robots are able to exert pressure similar to human peers. This study used the Asch paradigm, which shows how participants conform to others while performing a visual judgment task. We first replicated the finding that adults are influenced by their peers but showed that they resist social pressure from a group of small humanoid robots. Next, we repeated the study with 7- to 9-year-old children and showed that children conform to the robots. This raises opportunities as well as concerns for the use of social robots with young and vulnerable cross-sections of society; although conforming can be beneficial, the potential for misuse and the potential impact of erroneous performance cannot be ignored.", "Clinical trials are time consuming, expensive, and often burdensome on patients.

The Bender Visual-Motor Gestalt Test, widely used for the evaluation of this area, is meant for children up to 11 years. In adolescence, the changes associated with puberty generate nonlinear anthropometric development resulting in mild and temporary incoordination. This study investigated the relation between visual-motor development measured by the Bender test and pubertal changes according to the Tanner scale. In all 134 adolescents of both sexes, aged from 10 to 15, who kept routine medical appointments, participated. We used the Bender Visual-Motor Gestalt Test, Raven's Progressive Matrices Test, and medical chart data. The techniques were applied individually. Pubertal changes were associated with the Bender test results showing higher scores at the G3 stage, the period corresponding to a growth spurt, compared to the G5 stage (p = .007, ES = .187), the post-growth spurt period in boys. Age and gender did not influence the Bender test scores. According to the Raven test, the g intelligence factor, interfered significantly in the visual-motor performance (r = -57%, p < .001). Schooling, repetition of a school year, and developmental problems (p = .002, ES = .156; p = .002, ES = .623; p < .001, ES = .880, respectively) obtained similar results. The Bender Test was sensitive to schooling and maturational problems during adolescence. There was an association between visual-motor development and sexual maturity in male adolescents. Our results indicate the usefulness of the Bender Test at older ages than those used in the test standardization.", "An electrical Impedance based tool is designed and developed to aid physicians performing clinical exams focusing on cancer detection. Current research envisions improvement in sensor-based measurement technology to differentiate malignant and benign lesions in human subjects. The tool differentiates malignant anomalies from nonmalignant anomalies using Electrical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS). This method exploits cancerous tissue behavior by using EIS technique to aid early detection of cancerous tissue. The correlation between tissue electrical properties and tissue pathologies is identified by offering an analysis technique based on the Cole model. Additional classification and decision-making algorithm is further developed for cancer detection. This research suggests that the sensitivity of tumor detection will increase when supplementary information from EIS and built-in intelligence are provided to the physician.", "Early diagnosis remains a significant challenge for many neurological disorders, especially for rare disorders where studying large cohorts is not possible. A novel solution that investigators have undertaken is combining advanced machine learning algorithms with resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging to unveil hidden pathological brain connectome patterns to uncover diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers. Recently, state-of-the-art deep learning techniques are outperforming traditional machine learning methods and are hailed as a milestone for artificial intelligence. However, whole brain classification that combines brain connectome with deep learning has been hindered by insufficient training samples. Inspired by the transfer learning strategy employed in computer vision, we exploited previously collected resting-state functional MRI data for healthy subjects from existing databases and transferred this knowledge for new disease classification tasks. We developed a deep transfer learning neural network (DTL-NN) framework for enhancing the classification of whole brain functional connectivity patterns. Briefly, we trained a stacked sparse autoencoder (SSAE) prototype to learn healthy functional connectivity patterns in an offline learning environment. Then, the SSAE prototype was transferred to a DTL-NN model for a new classification task. To test the validity of our framework, we collected resting-state functional MRI data from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) repository. Using autism spectrum disorder (ASD) classification as a target task, we compared the performance of our DTL-NN approach with a traditional deep neural network and support vector machine models across four ABIDE data sites that enrolled at least 60 subjects. As compared to traditional models, our DTL-NN approach achieved an improved performance in accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and area under receiver operating characteristic curve. These findings suggest that DTL-NN approaches could enhance disease classification for neurological conditions, where accumulating large neuroimaging datasets has been challenging.", "The speed and accuracy of new scientific discoveries - be it by humans or artificial intelligence - depends on the quality of the underlying data and on the technology to connect, search and share the data efficiently. In recent years, we have seen the rise of graph databases and semi-formal data models such as knowledge graphs to facilitate software approaches to scientific discovery. These approaches extend work based on formalised models, such as the Semantic Web. In this paper, we present our developments to connect, search and share data about genome-scale knowledge networks (GSKN). We have developed a simple application ontology based on OWL/RDF with mappings to standard schemas. We are employing the ontology to power data access services like resolvable URIs, SPARQL endpoints, JSON-LD web APIs and Neo4j-based knowledge graphs. We demonstrate how the proposed ontology and graph databases considerably improve search and access to interoperable and reusable biological knowledge (i.e. the FAIRness data principles).", "Clinical diagnostics of psycho-social and cognitive standard of performance in youth with mental disabilities. Abstract. The clinical diagnostics of cognitive limitations and the resulting problems of social development occurring in childhood and adolescence are essential for further stimulation as well as for possible treatment strategies for comorbid mental diseases. This complex process should be carried out on several levels and with different methods. The resulting praxis-oriented question is defined via the pros and cons of the current procedure for the recording of psycho-social and cognitive stage of development of young people with mental disabilities. The online-based research in relevant databases was conducted systematically and yielded 3,324 articles. After fully reviewing the disqualifying criteria, 30 procedures remained. Twenty-four procedures could be assigned to \"tests of development and intelligence\" and six to \"observer rating and self-report methods\". It becomes clear that the majority of treatments have been standardized for children and adolescents of average intelligence. Meaning, only inaccurate information regarding the participation of children and adolescents with intelligence impairments in the standardized sample were given. This goes hand in hand with qualifying criteria that were not tested in consideration of the needs of people with intelligence impairment. Despite the current unsatisfactory situation, there is a demand for diagnostic instruments of the psycho-social and cognitive standard of performance in youth with mental disabilities. Currently, K-ABC II and ADOS-2 are recommended in combination with the observer rating methods ADI-R, VFE, and SRS.\nZusammenfassung.

Dieser komplexe Prozess sollte auf mehreren Ebenen mit unterschiedlichen Methoden erfolgen. Die daraus resultierende praxisrelevante Frage ist, welche Vor- und Nachteile aktuelle Verfahren zur Erfassung des psychosozialen und kognitiven Entwicklungsstandes von Kindern und Jugendlichen mit Intelligenzminderung aufweisen. Die onlinebasierte systematische Literaturrecherche in einschl\u00e4gigen Datenbanken zu dieser Frage ergab 3 324 Artikel.

The purpose of this study was to replicate and expand upon these findings by evaluating the influence of a parent's depressive symptoms on a young person's executive functioning. Method: As part of a larger study, 135 children (54.8% female, aged 8-12) and one biological parent completed diagnostic screening interviews. Children then completed a brief executive functioning battery. Symptoms endorsed under the past major depressive episode module of the MINI International Neuropsychiatric Interview was used to measure depressive symptoms of parents. Results: While controlling for parent alcohol status and age, gender, intelligence, and current depressive symptoms of the child, linear regression models revealed that the parent's depressive symptoms significantly predicted deficits in Letter-Number Sequencing [b\u00a0=\u00a0-0.15 (0.07), p\u00a0<\u00a0.05] and Motor Speed [b\u00a0=\u00a0-0.17 (0.05), p\u00a0<\u00a0.005] on the Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System (D-KEFS) Trails Test. Parent depressive symptoms had no relationship with inhibition on the D-KEFS Color-Word Interference Test [b\u00a0=\u00a0-0.04 (0.14), p\u00a0=\u00a0.74] or the Verbal Working Memory subtest of the Stanford-Binet [b\u00a0=\u00a00.14 (0.12) p\u00a0=\u00a0.43]. Greater depressive symptoms in parents were associated with fewer perseverative errors on the Wisconsin Card Sorting Task (WCST) [b\u00a0=\u00a00.73 (0.32), p\u00a0<\u00a0.05]. Conclusion: In sum, a parent's depressive symptomatology was differentially associated with a young person's neurocognitive abilities. Clinical implications were discussed.", "To compare retired professional contact sport athletes with age-matched noncontact sport athletes on measures of executive function and mental health.\nThe University Concussion Management Clinic.\nTwenty-one retired National Football League (NFL) and National Hockey League (NHL) players (mean age 56 years) and 21 age-matched noncontact sport athlete controls.\nCase control.\nThe self- and informant-reported Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function-Adult form (BRIEF-A); Wisconsin Card Sorting Test; Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System; Trail Making Part A and B; Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale; Neuropsychological Assessment Battery; List Learning; Controlled Oral Word Association Test; Beck Depression Inventory; Beck Anxiety Inventory; and Personality Inventory of the DSM-5.\nFormer NFL and NHL players perceived themselves to have some impairment in 2 of the 9 domains of executive function on the BRIEF-A; however, their informants reported no difference when compared with informants of noncontact athletes. No significant differences were found when comparing contact sport athletes with noncontact athletes on objective neuropsychological testing. Contact sport athletes qualified as clinically anxious and had more \"unusual beliefs and experiences,\" although they remained within with age-based norms.\nParticipation in contact sports at the professional level may not lead to later-life executive dysfunction, as the popular media and some research currently suggest.", "The associations between higher intelligence test scores from early life and later good health, fewer illnesses, and longer life are recent discoveries. Researchers are mapping the extent of these associations and trying to understanding them. Part of the intelligence-health association has genetic origins. Recent advances in molecular genetic technology and statistical analyses have revealed that: intelligence and many health outcomes are highly polygenic; and that modest but widespread genetic correlations exist between intelligence and health, illness and mortality. Causal accounts of intelligence-health associations are still poorly understood. The contribution of education and socio-economic status\u2009-\u2009both of which are partly genetic in origin\u2009-\u2009to the intelligence-health associations are being explored.", "Cutaneous melanoma is the sixth most common malignant cancer in the USA. Among different subtypes of melanoma, nodular melanoma (NM) accounts about 14% of all cases but is responsible for more than 40% of melanoma deaths. Early diagnosis is the best method to improve melanoma prognosis. Unfortunately, early diagnosis of NM is particularly challenging given that patients often lack identifiable risk factors such as many moles or freckles. Moreover, early NM may mimic a range of benign skin lesions that are not routinely excised or biopsied in every day practice. For this reason, specific clinical and skin imaging clues have been proposed to improve early detection of NM. Areas covered: The review discusses about the noninvasive tools to diagnose thin melanoma, particularly NM. Expert commentary: Currently, dermatologists present a wide opportunity of diagnostic tools. Current data suggest that the early diagnosis of NM is a major challenge as the majority of early NM are symmetric, roundish, and lack specific pattern. Another promising strategy is based on recent data suggesting that artificial intelligence based on deep convolutional neural networking is able to outperform average dermatologist. Further research is necessary to validate the performance of this method in the real world and in the clinical setting.", "Executive functions are crucial for adaptive behavior in novel contexts. In healthy aging, these abilities are more sensitive to dysfunction than other cognitive abilities. The effect of aging on initiation, inhibition, and strategy use was investigated via performance on the Hayling Sentence Completion Test.\nThe standard Hayling Test and baseline cognitive tests were administered to healthy adults (N = 344), aged 18-89 years (cross-sectional study). Bivariate Pearson's correlations, partial correlations, and regression analyses were used to assess the impact of aging on the components of the Hayling Test.\nThere were significant positive correlations between age and response time for both Initiation and Suppression, and the number of Suppression Errors. Further, older age was negatively associated with strategy use. These findings remained significant after controlling for demographic factors such as education and crystallized intelligence and other cognitive functions sensitive to aging such as fluid intelligence, attention, working memory and semantic and phonemic word fluency.\nThis study provides clarification of the effect of age on the processes of initiation, inhibition, and strategy generation across the adult lifespan. The focus and analysis of strategy on the Hayling Test provides clinicians with an additional and valuable measure of executive functioning. That is, it provides insight into how older adults may be able to compensate for decline in these processes, and thus maximize quality of life and independence.", "Higher educational attainment (EA) is negatively associated with schizophrenia (SZ). However, recent studies found a positive genetic correlation between EA and SZ. We investigate possible causes of this counterintuitive finding using genome-wide association study results for EA and SZ (N\u2009=\u2009443,581) and a replication cohort (1169 controls; 1067 cases) with deeply phenotyped SZ patients. We find strong genetic dependence between EA and SZ that cannot be explained by chance, linkage disequilibrium, or assortative mating. Instead, several genes seem to have pleiotropic effects on EA and SZ, but without a clear pattern of sign concordance. Using EA as a proxy phenotype, we isolate FOXO6 and SLITRK1 as novel candidate genes for SZ. Our results reveal that current SZ diagnoses aggregate over at least two disease subtypes: one part resembles high intelligence and bipolar disorder (BIP), while the other part is a cognitive disorder that is independent of BIP.", "To study the variation in opioid prescribing among emergency physicians and facilities for discharged adult ED patients.\nWe conducted a retrospective analysis of ED visits from five U.S. hospitals between January and May 2014 using records from Data to Intelligence (D2i). We examined physician- and facility-level variation in opioid prescription rates for discharged ED patients. We calculated unadjusted opioid prescription rates at the physician and facility levels and used a multivariable mixed-effect logistic regression model to examine within-facility physician variation in opioid prescription adjusting for patient and situational factors including time of presentation, ED census, and physician workload.\nIn 47,304 visits across five EDs, median patient age was 40\u202fyears old (IQR 28,55), and 89% had some form of insurance. There were 17,098 (36%) ED discharges with at least one opioid prescription. The unadjusted facility-level opioid prescription rate ranged from 24%-46%. Among 253 ED physicians, the adjusted opioid prescription rate varied from 22%-76%. Increased physician workload is related to decreased odds of opioid prescription at ED discharge for the lowest (<3 patients) and moderate (6-9 patients) physician workload levels, while the association weakened with increasing levels of workload.\nThere was substantial physician and facility variation in opioid prescription for discharged adult ED patients. Emergency physicians were less likely to prescribe opioids when their workload was lower, and this effect diminished at high workload levels. Understanding situational and other factors that explain this variation is important given the rising U.S. opioid epidemic and the need for urgent intervention.", "Extended margin tumor resection beyond the abnormal area detected by magnetic resonance imaging, defined as supratotal resection, could improve the outcomes of patients with lower grade gliomas (LGGs). The aim of the present study was to assess the surgical outcomes of awake brain mapping to achieve supratotal resection with determination of the normal brain tissue boundaries beyond the tumor of frontal LGGs, in both dominant and nondominant hemispheres.\nWe analyzed the data from 9 patients with diffuse frontal LGGs who had undergone supratotal resection with awake surgery from January 2016 to November\u00a02017.\nThe frontal aslant tract was identified as the functional boundary in 4 of 5 left frontal tumor cases (80%). Working memory impairments during dorsolateral prefrontal cortex stimulation with digit span and/or visual N-back tasks were detected in all 4 patients (100%) with right-frontal tumor. The neurocognitive outcomes were significantly improved after surgery, as shown by the mean Wechsler adult intelligence scale III scores for verbal intelligence quotient (P\u00a0= 0.04) and verbal comprehension (P\u00a0= 0.03) and the mean Wechsler memory scale-revised scores for generalized memory (P\u00a0= 0.04) and delayed recall (P\u00a0= 0.04).\nThe results of the present study have provided evidence that awake mapping can enable the preservation of higher neurocognitive function, including working memory and spatial cognition in patients with nondominant right frontal tumors. Despite the small number of cases, our findings suggest the surgical benefit of awake surgery for supratotal resection of diffuse frontal LGGs.", "The differential diagnosis of atypical dementia remains difficult. The use of positron emission tomography (PET) still represents the gold standard for imaging diagnostics. According to the current evidence, however, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is almost equal to fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET, but only when using new big data and machine learning methods. In cases of atypical dementia, especially in younger patients and for follow-up, MRI is preferable to computed tomography (CT). In the clinical routine, promising MRI procedures are e.\u202fg. the automated volumetry of anatomical 3D images, as well as a\u00a0non-contrast-enhanced MRI perfusion method, called arterial spin labeling (ASL). Because of the rapidly growing amount of biomarker data, there is a\u00a0need for computer-aided big data analyses and artificial intelligence. Based on fast analyses of the diverse and rapidly increasing amount of clinical, imaging, epidemiological, molecular genetic and economic data, new knowledge on the pathogenesis, prevention and treatment can be generated. Technical availability, homogenization of the underlying data and the availability of large reference data are the basis for the widespread establishment of promising analytical methods.", "A major goal for the next generation of artificial intelligence (AI) is to build machines that are able to reason and cope with novel tasks, environments, and situations in a manner that approaches the abilities of animals. Evidence from precocial species suggests that driving learning through suitable priors can help to successfully face this challenge.", "This observational study aimed to use artificial intelligence to describe the impact of orthognathic treatment on facial attractiveness and age appearance. Pre- and post-treatment photographs (n=2164) of 146 consecutive orthognathic patients were collected for this longitudinal retrospective single-centre study. Every image was annotated with patient-related data (age; sex; malocclusion; performed surgery). For every image, facial attractiveness (score: 0-100) and apparent age were established with dedicated convolutional neural networks trained on >0.5million images for age estimation and with >17million ratings for attractiveness. Results for pre- and post-treatment photographs were averaged for every patient separately, and apparent age compared to real age (appearance). Changes in appearance and facial attractiveness were statistically examined. Analyses were performed on the entire sample and subgroups (sex; malocclusion; performed surgery). According to the algorithms, most patients' appearance improved with treatment (66.4%), resulting in younger appearance of nearly 1year [mean change: -0.93years (95% confidence interval (CI): -1.50; -0.36); p=0.002), especially after profile-altering surgery. Orthognathic treatment had similarly a beneficial effect on attractiveness in 74.7% [mean difference: 1.22 (95% CI: 0.81; 1.63); p<0.001], especially after lower jaw surgery. This investigation illustrates that artificial intelligence might be considered to score facial attractiveness and apparent age in orthognathic patients.", "Radiographic bone age assessment (BAA) is used in the evaluation of pediatric endocrine and metabolic disorders. We previously developed an automated artificial intelligence (AI) deep learning algorithm to perform BAA using convolutional neural networks. We compared the BAA performance of a cohort of pediatric radiologists with and without AI assistance.\nSix board-certified, subspecialty trained pediatric radiologists interpreted 280 age- and gender-matched bone age radiographs ranging from 5 to 18\u00a0years. Three of those radiologists then performed BAA with AI assistance. Bone age accuracy and root mean squared error (RMSE) were used as measures of accuracy. Intraclass correlation coefficient evaluated inter-rater variation.\nAI BAA accuracy was 68.2% overall and 98.6% within 1\u00a0year, and the mean six-reader cohort accuracy was 63.6 and 97.4% within 1\u00a0year. AI RMSE was 0.601\u00a0years, while mean single-reader RMSE was 0.661\u00a0years. Pooled RMSE decreased from 0.661 to 0.508\u00a0years, all individually decreasing with AI assistance. ICC without AI was 0.9914 and with AI was 0.9951.\nAI improves radiologist's bone age assessment by increasing accuracy and decreasing variability and RMSE. The utilization of AI by radiologists improves performance compared to AI alone, a radiologist alone, or a pooled cohort of experts. This suggests that AI may optimally be utilized as an adjunct to radiologist interpretation of imaging studies to improve performance.", "While the diagnostic criteria for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) have evolved over the years, some children with impairing ADHD symptoms fail to meet the full diagnostic threshold for the disorder. The main aim of this study was to evaluate the morbidity and dysfunction of subsyndromal ADHD in the clinical setting.\nSubthreshold and full ADHD subjects were derived from consecutive referrals (n = 2,947) to a pediatric psychopharmacology program at a major academic center. Subjects were diagnosed with subthreshold ADHD if they met at least 1 of the following criteria: (1) their age at onset for ADHD was \u2265 7 years; (2) they had \u2265 5 but < 8 ADHD symptoms using the DSM-III-R or \u2265 4 but < 6 ADHD inattentive or hyperactive/impulsive symptoms using the DSM-IV. Healthy controls were derived from 2 identically designed longitudinal case-control studies of youth with and without ADHD. Psychiatric assessments relied on clinical structured interviews and measures of psychopathology, social functioning, cognitive ability, and academic achievement.\nOf the 1,931 children diagnosed with ADHD, 140 (7%) were diagnosed with subthreshold ADHD. 48% of subthreshold ADHD subjects had an age at onset \u2265 7 years, and 73% had insufficient symptoms. Reanalysis of findings using DSM-5 criteria showed that only 21% of our subthreshold ADHD subjects would have met DSM-5 criteria based on age at onset of < 12 years, while 79% would have maintained their subthreshold diagnoses. Subjects with subthreshold ADHD differed from controls in the mean number of comorbid disorders; rates of mood, anxiety, and elimination disorders (all P < .001) and substance use disorders (P < .05); scores on all Child Behavior Checklist clinical and social functioning scales; scores on 7 of the 10 Social Adjustment Inventory for Children and Adolescents scales; rates of requiring extra help in school and being placed in a special class; and scores on 4 of the 5 Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised Version subscales (excluding Digit Span) as well as in Freedom from Distractibility Index score (P < .001). Subthreshold and full ADHD subjects had similarly elevated Global Assessment of Functioning scores versus controls (P < .001), but subjects with subthreshold ADHD had fewer perinatal complications and better family functioning scores and were more likely to be female and older and to come from families of higher socioeconomic status than subjects with full ADHD.\nClinically referred children failing to meet full-threshold diagnosis for ADHD due to either insufficient symptoms or later age at onset have patterns of clinical features highly similar to those with the full syndrome. These results extend to previously reported findings in nonreferred samples documenting the high morbidity and disability associated with subthreshold ADHD.", "This study compared temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) patients with amygdala lesion (AL) without hippocampal sclerosis (HS) (TLE-AL) with patients with TLE and HS without AL (TLE-HS). Both subtypes of TLE arose from the right hemisphere. The TLE-AL group exhibited a lower Working Memory Index (WMI) on the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, third edition (WAIS-III), indicating that the amygdala in the right hemisphere is involved in memory-related function. [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission topography (FDG-PET) showed glucose hypometabolism limited to the right uncus for the TLE-AL group. The results suggest the importance of considering cognitive functions in the non-dominant hemisphere to prevent impairment after surgery.", "There is evidence of mental rotation (MR) abilities responding to training even in older adults, but it is still not clear whether such training would have generalized and maintained effects. The aim of the present study was to examine the specific short- and long-term gains, and any transfer effects, induced by rotation training in healthy older adults. The study involved 43 healthy older adults: 14 practiced with 2 MR tasks, that is, a 3D same/different comparisons task and a Tetris game (the Mental Rotation [MR] group); 15 were trained to use a strategy based on concrete object manipulation and imagery, then practiced with the 2 rotation tasks (Strategy [S] + MR group); and 14 were involved in alternative nonspatial activities (active control group). Transfer and maintenance effects were assessed (after 1 month) using tasks similar to those used in the training (criterion tasks), different spatial tasks (mental rotation and perspective taking tasks) and a fluid intelligence task. The results showed a trend toward an improvement in successive training sessions. The S + MR and MR groups both gained substantially more than the active control group in the short- and long-term, in the criterion tasks and most of the tasks testing transfer effects. The S + MR group showed greater long-term gains than the MR group in most tasks. These findings support a positive effect of rotation training in older adults, particularly when associated with strategy use.

It diverged from other cephalopods in terms of body plan, anatomy, behavior, and intelligence. It independently evolved the largest and most complex nervous system and sophisticated behaviors among invertebrates in a separate evolutionary lineage. It is equipped with unusual traits that confer it an incredible evolutionary success: arms capable of a wide range of movements with no skeletal support; developed eyes with a complex visual behavior; vestibular system; primitive \"hearing\" system; chemoreceptors located in epidermis, suckers, and mouth; and a discrete olfactory organ. As if these were not enough, the occurrence of recently discovered adult neurogenesis and the high level of RNA editing give it a master key to face environmental challenges. Here we provide an overview of some of the winning evolutionary inventions that octopus puts in place such as the capacity to see color, smell by touch, edit own genes, and rejuvenate own brain.", "Due to the special nature of Chinese Herbal medicine and the complexity of its clinical use, it is difficult to identify and evaluate its toxicity and resulting herb induced liver injury (HILI).\nFirst, the database would provide full profile of HILI from the basic ingredients to clinical outcomes by the most advanced algorithms of artificial intelligence, and it is also possible that we can predict possibilities of HILI after patients taking Chinese herbs by individual patient evaluation and prediction. Second, the database would solve the chaos and lack of the relevant data faced by the current basic research and clinical practice of Chinese Herbal Medicine. Third, we can also screen the susceptible patients from the database and thus prevent the accidents of HILI from the very beginning.\nThe Roussel Uclaf Causality Assessment Method (RUCAM) is the most accepted method to evaluate DILI, but at present before using the RUCAM evaluation method, data resource collection and analysis are yet to be perfected. Based on existing research on drug-metabolizing enzymes mediating reactive metabolites (RMs), the aim of this study is to explore the possibilities and methods of building multidimensional hierarchical database composing of RMs evidence library, Chinese herbal evidence library, and individualized reports evidence library of herb induced liver injury HILI.\nThe potential benefits lie in its ability to organize, use vast amounts of evidence and use big data mining techniques at the center for Chinese herbal medicine liver toxicity research, which is the most difficult key point of scientific research to be investigated in the next few years.", "We evaluated three interface input methods for a simulated manned-unmanned teaming (MUM-T) supervisory control system designed for Air Mission Commanders (AMCs) in Black Hawk helicopters.\nA key component of the U.S. Army's vision for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is to integrate UAVs into manned missions, called MUM-T (Department of Defense, 2010). One application of MUM-T is to provide the AMC of a team of Black Hawk helicopters control of multiple UAVs, offering advanced reconnaissance and real-time intelligence of flight routes and landing zones.\nParticipants supervised a (simulated) team of two helicopters and three UAVs while traveling toward a landing zone to deploy ground troops. Participants classified aerial photographs collected by UAVs, monitored instrument warnings, and responded to radio communications. We manipulated interface input modality (touch, voice, multimodal) and task load (number of photographs).\nCompared with voice, touch and multimodal control resulted in better performance on all tasks and resulted in lower subjective workload and greater subjective situation awareness, ps < .05. Participants with higher spatial ability classified more aerial photographs ( r = .75) and exhibited shorter response times to instrument warnings ( r = -.58) than participants with lower spatial ability.\nTouchscreen and multimodal control were superior to voice control in a supervisory control task that involved monitoring visual displays and communicating on radio channels.\nAlthough voice control is often considered a more natural and less physically demanding input method, caution is needed when designing visual displays for users sharing common communication channels.", "What happens when hyperactive little boys grow up? Drs. Klein, Mannuzza, and their research team have been examining this important question for more than three decades. Ramos-Olazagasti et\u00a0al., published in this issue of JAACAP, provide details regarding early predictors of adult functioning for children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).1 Starting with publications in the 1980s, the research team reported on a cohort of boys of white ethnicity, 6 to 12 years of age with what we now call ADHD, of average intelligence, but without conduct disorder, and compared them as older adolescents to boys with no childhood behavior problems. This seminal study was among the first to document that a substantial proportion of boys with ADHD continue to show the core symptoms of inattention, impulsiveness, and hyperactivity at a mean age of 18 years as well as worse educational, social, and psychiatric outcomes, including non-alcohol substance use disorder, than do comparison boys, thus setting the stage for continued poor functioning as adults. Since the 1980s, there have been major efforts to develop interventions to address the difficulties for children with ADHD and to avert negative outcomes, including an explosion in the controversial use of psychostimulant medications to treat what many in the lay public still see as active little boys. In recent years, ADHD as a disorder has remained at the forefront of the nature-versus-nurture discussion in the field of neurodevelopmental psychiatry, as researchers strive to uncover the neuroanatomic, cognitive, physiologic, genetic, and epigenetic etiologies of the disorder.", "In this brief contribution, I distinguish between code-driven and data-driven regulation as novel instantiations of legal regulation. Before moving deeper into data-driven regulation, I explain the difference between law and regulation, and the relevance of such a difference for the rule of law. I discuss artificial legal intelligence (ALI) as a means to enable quantified legal prediction and argumentation mining which are both based on machine learning. This raises the question of whether the implementation of such technologies should count as law or as regulation, and what this means for their further development. Finally, I propose the concept of 'agonistic machine learning' as a means to bring data-driven regulation under the rule of law. This entails obligating developers, lawyers and those subject to the decisions of ALI to re-introduce adversarial interrogation at the level of its computational architecture.This article is part of a discussion meeting issue 'The growing ubiquity of algorithms in society: implications, impacts and innovations'.", "Trait emotional intelligence (trait EI) is a relevant construct that could promote positive development in adolescents and may predict a number of affect-related outcomes. However, studies focused on its antecedents are still scarce. The main aim of this study is to examine the intergenerational transmission of trait EI from parents to adolescents and the mediating role of parental autonomy support and psychological control.\nOur sample was comprised of 152 cohabiting families, with adolescents (75 males and 77 females) between 16 and 17 years old (M\u202f=\u202f16.45; SD\u202f=\u202f0.50).\nResults suggested that paternal and maternal trait EI positively predicted paternal and maternal autonomy support and psychological control, and adolescent trait EI was predicted by maternal trait EI, adolescent perception of parental autonomy support and adolescent perception of parental psychological control. Adolescent perception of parental autonomy support and adolescent perception of parental psychological control were shown to act as mediators between adolescents' trait EI and paternal and maternal trait EI.\nThe results extend the literature on the role of parents in the development of trait EI and confirm the relevance of trait EI for affect-related outcomes.", "Over the past decade, new technologies, devices, and methods have been developed to assist in the diagnosis of cutaneous melanocytic lesions.\nOur objective was to evaluate the performance of an augmented intelligence system in the assessment of atypical pigmented lesions.\nNine atypical pigmented lesions on 8 patients were evaluated prior to surgical removal. No lesions had received previous treatment other than a diagnostic biopsy. Prior to surgical removal, each lesion was evaluated by an Augmented Intelligence Dermal Imager (AID) and the assessment parameters reviewed in light of the final histopathological diagnosis.\nThe AID was used to evaluate a limited set of atypical pigmented lesions and showed sensitivity and specificity of 82% and 61%, respectively, based on its internal risk assessment algorithms.\nThese cases represent early assessments of the AID in a clinical setting, all prior assessments having been carried out on digital images. The information received from these evaluations requires further validation and analysis to be able to extrapolate its clinical usefulness.\nThe AID combines dermoscopy, hypodermoscopy, and a trained augmented algorithm to produce a diffusion map representing the features of each lesion compared to the learned characteristics from a database of known dermoscopy images of lesions with definitive prior diagnosis. The information gathered from the diffusion map might be used to calculate a malignancy risk factor for the lesion compared to known melanoma features. This malignancy risk factor could be helpful in providing information to justify the biopsy of an atypical pigmented lesion.", "The advent of DNA technologies for field-based application promises to provide rapid intelligence to aid investigations. Their validation and adoption by enforcement groups have demonstrated utility in sample screening and prioritisation, but field application in some areas of forensic science, such as human remains identification, is little evidenced. Assessing the ability of such approaches to provide meaningful data is critical as decomposition is likely to complicate analysis and limit the effective use of such field-based DNA interventions. This research assessed the ability to collect viable DNA data in the field using the ParaDNA Field Instrument and Intelligence Test chemistry. Different sample collection methods were assessed; direct from skin surface; direct from exposed tissue; indirect from muscle swab transferred to FTA card; and from larvae on the donors. Samples were collected and processed on-site at the Anthropology Research Facility, University of Tennessee. The data show that the muscle tissue provided the most effective sample template and, using this approach, it was possible to generate STR profiles from human remains in under two hours from the time of sample collection. STR profile data were collected up to four days from donor placement (114 Accumulated Degree Days). After this time there was a rapid decrease in the quality of the profiles collected due to the onset of decomposition. The data also show that effective sample recovery was not possible from the surface of the skin, exposed tissue or from carrion larvae. Inhibition studies in the laboratory suggest that by-products of the decomposition process are the primary mode of failure. Together these data suggests a possible application for screening and prioritisation in criminal casework but highlights issues that may affect the success of the approach.", "Prenatal cocaine/polydrug exposure (PCE) may increase vulnerability to substance use disorders due to associated cognitive deficits. We examined whether neurocognitive deficits in executive functions and attention observed in PCE children persisted to adolescence when compared to non-cocaine/polydrug (NCE) children, and whether adolescent substance use (tobacco, alcohol, marijuana) was also associated with neurocognitive deficits.\n354 (180 PCE, 174 NCE) adolescents in a longitudinal study from birth were administered the Wechsler Intelligence Scales for Children - IV (WISC-IV), and the Integrated Visual and Auditory Continuous Performance Test (IVA/CPT) at age 15.5. Assessments of prenatal exposure to cocaine, alcohol, marijuana, and tobacco and measures of use at age 15.5 were taken. Confounding factors measured included lead, the caregiving environment, and violence exposure. Relationships between drug use and prenatal exposures on outcomes were assessed through multiple regression.\nAdolescents with PCE had deficits in Perceptual Reasoning IQ and visual attention. Prenatal alcohol exposure predicted verbal and working memory IQ and visual and auditory attention deficits. Adolescent tobacco, alcohol, and marijuana use predicted attention in addition to PCE, lead and the caregiving environment.\nPrenatal cocaine and alcohol exposure and adolescent use of substances are associated with neurocognitive deficits known to increase vulnerability to SUDs.", "To improve the detection of corneal ectasia susceptibility using tomographic data.\nMulticenter case-control study.\nData from patients from 5 different clinics from South America, the United States, and Europe were evaluated. Artificial intelligence (AI) models were generated using Pentacam HR (Oculus, Wetzlar, Germany) parameters to discriminate the preoperative data of 3 groups: stable laser-assisted in\u00a0situ keratomileusis (LASIK) cases (2980 patients with minimum follow-up of 7 years), ectasia susceptibility (71 eyes of 45 patients that developed post-LASIK ectasia [PLE]), and clinical keratoconus (KC; 182 patients). Model accuracy was independently tested in a different set of stable LASIK cases (298 patients with minimum follow-up of 4 years) and in 188 unoperated patients with very asymmetric ectasia (VAE); these patients presented normal topography (VAE-NT) in 1 eye and clinically diagnosed ectasia in the other (VAE-E). Accuracy was evaluated with ROC curves.\nThe random forest (RF) provided highest accuracy among AI models in this sample with 100% sensitivity for clinical ectasia (KC+VAE-E; cutoff 0.52), being named Pentacam Random Forest Index (PRFI). Considering all cases, the PRFI had an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.992 (94.2% sensitivity, 98.8% specificity; cutoff 0.216), being statistically higher than the Belin/Ambr\u00f3sio deviation (BAD-D; AUC\u00a0= 0.960, 87.3% sensitivity, 97.5% specificity; P\u00a0= .006, DeLong's test). The optimized cutoff of 0.125 provided sensitivity of 85.2% for VAE-NT and 80% for PLE, with 96.6% specificity.\nThe PRFI enhances ectasia diagnosis. Further integrations with corneal biomechanical parameters and with the corneal impact from laser vision correction are needed for assessing ectasia risk.", "There is evidence of an auditory-perceptual component of stuttering, and backward masking (BM) is a task to explore that role. Prior research reported poorer thresholds for BM tones in a group of children who persisted in stuttering compared to those for a group that did not persist. This study examined BM for adults who stutter for tones and for speech, which tests a phonetic aspect of hearing.\nEight persons who stutter (PWS) were closely matched with eight controls (PNS) in terms of phonological abilities, verbal span tasks, age, sex and non-verbal intelligence. These participants were examined for their ability to recognize vowel-consonant (VC) speech syllables and tones in BM paradigm with 0 ms and 300 ms masker to signal onset conditions.\nPWS showed significantly poorer performance for speech syllable recognition in quiet and in conditions with masking noise. The pattern of speech errors was similar in both groups, but the PWS produced more errors. A significant condition by group interaction in backward masking for tones was attributed to higher masked thresholds in PWS than in PNS in the 0 ms delay condition for BM for tones.\nThis was the first study to examine BM for speech in PWS. Results provide support for a small auditory-perceptual deficit for speech understanding in adults who stutter that was revealed in the absence of a lexical context. The speech results are explained in terms of possible indistinct phoneme boundaries in PWS and the effects of vowel context in speech recognition.", "Since 2013, the French Animal Health Epidemic Intelligence System (in French: Veille Sanitaire Internationale, VSI) has been monitoring signals of the emergence of new and exotic animal infectious diseases worldwide. Once detected, the VSI team verifies the signals and issues early warning reports to French animal health authorities when potential threats to France are detected. To improve detection of signals from online news sources, we designed the Platform for Automated extraction of Disease Information from the web (PADI-web). PADI-web automatically collects, processes and extracts English-language epidemiological information from Google News. The core component of PADI-web is a combined information extraction (IE) method founded on rule-based systems and data mining techniques. The IE approach allows extraction of key information on diseases, locations, dates, hosts and the number of cases mentioned in the news. We evaluated the combined method for IE on a dataset of 352 disease-related news reports mentioning the diseases involved, locations, dates, hosts and the number of cases. The combined method for IE accurately identified (F-score) 95% of the diseases and hosts, respectively, 85% of the number of cases, 83% of dates and 80% of locations from the disease-related news. We assessed the sensitivity of PADI-web to detect primary outbreaks of four emerging animal infectious diseases notifiable to the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE). From January to June 2016, PADI-web detected signals for 64% of all primary outbreaks of African swine fever, 53% of avian influenza, 25% of bluetongue and 19% of foot-and-mouth disease. PADI-web timely detected primary outbreaks of avian influenza and foot-and-mouth disease in Asia, i.e. they were detected 8 and 3 days before immediate notification to OIE, respectively.", "Mindfulness-based training (MBT) and transcranial electrical stimulation (TES) methods such as direct current stimulation (tDCS) have demonstrated promise for the augmentation of cognitive abilities. The current study investigated the potential compatibility of concurrent \"electrical\" MBT and tDCS (or eMBT) by testing its combined effects on behavioral and neurophysiological indices of working memory (WM) and attentional resource allocation. Thirty-four healthy participants were randomly assigned to either a MBT task with tDCS group (eMBT) or an active control training task with sham tDCS (Control) group. Training lasted 4-weeks, with up to twenty MBT sessions and with up to eight of those sessions that were eMBT sessions. Electroencephalography was acquired during varying WM load conditions using the n-back task (1-, 2-, 3-back), along with performance on complex WM span tasks (operation and symmetry span) and fluid intelligence measures (Ravens and Shipley) before and after training. Improved performance was observed only on the 3-back and spatial span tasks for eMBT but not the Control group. During 3-back performance in the eMBT group, an increase in P3 amplitude and theta power at electrode site Pz was also observed, along with a simultaneous decrease in frontal midline P3 amplitude and theta power compared to the Control group. These results are consistent with the neural efficiency hypothesis, where higher cognitive capacity was associated with more distributed brain activity (i.e., increase in parietal and decrease in frontal amplitudes). Future longitudinal studies are called upon to further examine the direct contributions of tDCS on MBT by assessing the differential effects of electrode montage, polarity, current strength and a direct contrast between the eMBT and MBT conditions on performance and neuroimaging outcome data. While preliminary, the current results provided evidence for the potential compatibility of using eMBT to modulate WM capacity through the allocation of attention and its neurophysiological correlates.", "Education is negatively associated with most major causes of death. Prior work ignores the premise that cause-specific hazards are interdependent and that both education and mortality depend on cognitive ability. We analyse Swedish men aged 18-63, focusing on months lost due to specific causes-which solves the interdependence problem-and use a structural model that accounts for confounding due to cognitive ability. In a standard Cox model controlling for Intelligence Quotient, improving education is associated with large decreases in mortality for major causes of death. In the structural model, improving education is associated with a small decrease in months lost for most causes and education levels. Among the least educated, however, improving education strongly reduces the months lost, mainly those lost from external causes, such as accidents and suicide. Results suggest that conventional analysis of education and mortality may be biased, even if accounting for observed cognition.", "In an observational longitudinal study of a sub-sample of the Aberdeen 1936 birth cohort, from age 62 to 77 years, we investigated childhood intelligence, social class, education, life-course social mobility, memory test performance and memory decline in late life. We examined 388 local residents who had attended school in Aberdeen in 1947 and measured Auditory-Verbal Learning Test (AVLT) at recruitment age about 64 years and up to five times until age about 77 years. Better performance at age about 64 on AVLT was predicted by early socioeconomic status (SES), social mobility and childhood intelligence. The trajectory of AVLT decline was steeper in those who had received less education. This relationship was independent of childhood ability, sex, SES in childhood and social mobility. The protection of memory by education suggests that education supports resilience to age-related cognitive impairment. Upward social mobility does not enhance this effect, suggesting that resilience to age-related decline may be established in early life.", "To test the hypothesis that mild cognitive impairment (MCI) rates are higher among retired professional contact sport athletes than in noncontact athlete controls and compare history of contact sports with other MCI risk factors.\nUniversity Concussion Management Clinic.\nTwenty-one retired National Football League and National Hockey League players and 21 aged-matched noncontact athlete controls.\nCase-control.\nComprehensive criteria were used to assess MCI based on the following: Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System; Trail Making Parts A and B; Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Third Edition subtests; Neuropsychological Assessment Battery Memory Module List Learning, Story Learning, and Naming subtests; and Controlled Oral Word Association Test. The Wide Range Achievement Test was used as a proxy measure for IQ. Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk factors were self-reported and blood cholesterol was measured. Depression was measured by the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI).\nEight contact sport athletes (38%) and 3 noncontact athletes (14%) met MCI criteria (P = .083). Contact sport athletes' scores were significantly worse on Letter Fluency and List B Immediate Recall. Contact athletes were more obese, had more vascular risk factors, and had higher scores on the BDI than controls.\nAthletes with a history of playing professional contact sports had more vascular risk factors and higher depression scores. MCI rates were somewhat higher, though not significant.", "To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the long-term administration of diazoxide in patients with hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia, a post-marketing surveillance study was conducted. Between 2008 and 2015, with a maximum observation period of 7\u00a0yr, 384 patients were monitored; 117 (30.5%) experienced at least one adverse drug reaction (ADR). The most commonly observed ADR was hypertrichosis (8.6%). The incidence of water retention-related ADRs and cardiac failure-related ADRs was 8.3% and 3.4%, respectively, and many of these occurred within the first 2 mo of treatment. The mean fasting blood glucose level was 44.9 mg/dL at baseline and was maintained at > 70 mg/dL, the control target, for 4\u00a0yr. A total of 113 infants < 1 yr of age were evaluated for the prognosis for intelligence, and a majority (77.9%) were assessed as \"normal\" at the final evaluation. Most ADRs occurred at an early stage of treatment and blood glucose levels were well controlled during long-term administration. The proportion of \"normal\" patients tended to be higher in those who started treatment at a younger age. However, because of the exploratory nature of this analysis, potential effects of coexisting or underlying diseases and the age of onset or diagnosis should not be ignored.", "Using artificial intelligence (AI) technology to replace human decision-making will inevitably create new risks whose consequences are unforeseeable. This naturally leads to calls for regulation, but I argue that it is too early to attempt a general system of AI regulation. Instead, we should work incrementally within the existing legal and regulatory schemes which allocate responsibility, and therefore liability, to persons. Where AI clearly creates risks which current law and regulation cannot deal with adequately, then new regulation will be needed. But in most cases, the current system can work effectively if the producers of AI technology can provide sufficient transparency in explaining how AI decisions are made. Transparency ex post can often be achieved through retrospective analysis of the technology's operations, and will be sufficient if the main goal is to compensate victims of incorrect decisions. Ex ante transparency is more challenging, and can limit the use of some AI technologies such as neural networks. It should only be demanded by regulation where the AI presents risks to fundamental rights, or where society needs reassuring that the technology can safely be used. Masterly inactivity in regulation is likely to achieve a better long-term solution than a rush to regulate in ignorance.This article is part of a discussion meeting issue 'The growing ubiquity of algorithms in society: implications, impacts and innovations'.", "Industry 4.0 is an updated concept of smart production, which is identified with the fourth industrial revolution and the emergence of cyber-physical systems. Industry 4.0 is the next stage in the digitization of productions and industries, where such technologies and concepts as the Internet of things, big data, predictive analytics, cloud computing, machine learning, machine interaction, artificial intelligence, robotics, 3D printing, augmented reality. As an area of therapy with the best market potential and one of the most expensive global diseases, diabetes attracts the best healthcare players, who use innovative technologies. Current trends in digitalization of diabetes management are presented.", "The objective of this study was to identify the extent to which artificial intelligence could be used in the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease from ioflupane-123 (\u00b9\u00b2\u00b3I) single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) dopamine transporter scans using transfer learning.\nA data set of 54 normal and 54 abnormal \u00b9\u00b2\u00b3I SPECT scans was amplified 44-fold using a process of image augmentation. This resulted in a training set of 2376 normal and 2376 abnormal images. This was used to retrain the top layer of the Inception v3 network. The resulting neural network functioned as a classifier for new \u00b9\u00b2\u00b3I SPECT scans as either normal or abnormal. A completely separate set of 45 \u00b9\u00b2\u00b3I SPECT scans were used for final testing of the network.\nThe area under the receiver-operator curve in final testing was 0.87. This corresponded to a test sensitivity of 96.3%, a specificity of 66.7%, a positive predictive value of 81.3% and a negative predictive value of 92.3%, using an optimum diagnostic threshold.\nThis study has provided proof of concept for the use of transfer learning, from convolutional neural networks pretrained on nonmedical images, for the interpretation of \u00b9\u00b2\u00b3I SPECT scans. This has been shown to be possible in this study even with a very small sample size. This technique is likely to be applicable to many areas of diagnostic imaging.", "Artificial intelligence is increasingly becoming a part of everyday life. This raises the question whether clinical neurology can benefit from these novel methods to increase diagnostic accuracy. Several recent studies have used machine learning classifiers to predict whether subjects suffer from a neurological disorder. This article discusses whether these methods are ready to make their entrance into clinical practice. The underlying principles of classification will be explored, as well as the potential pitfalls. Strengths of machine learning methods are that they are unbiased and very sensitive to patterns emerging from small changes spread across a large number of variables. Potential pitfalls are that building reliable classifiers requires large amounts of well-selected data and extensive validation. Currently, machine learning classifiers offer neurologists a new diagnostic tool which can aid in the diagnosis of cases with a high degree of uncertainty.", "Cognitive impairment is commonly seen in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Few studies have shown a correlation between loss of different isoforms of the DMD gene and cognitive impairment.\nThe objective of the study was to determine whether correlation exists in the location of mutation in DMD gene or loss of different isoforms and cognitive impairment in children with DMD in the Indian population.\nTen children were evaluated. Gene mutation analysis was done by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification method. The isoforms affected were inferred from mutation location in each of these patients. Binet Kamat Intelligence Test (BKT) and Bender Gestalt test (BGT) were administered.\nAll male patients were aged between 4 and 9 years. Genetic analysis showed deletion in all patients, with seven having deletion in \"hotspot\" regions (exon 43-52). Psychometric analysis by BGT and BKT showed mean score of 8.6 and mean IQ score of 85.5, respectively. Comparison between patients with hotspot mutations and mutations in other regions, for mean IQ score and BGT score, was statistically significant (P = 0.132 and P = 0.005, respectively). The difference in the IQ score between patients with isolated Dp427 loss (n = 3) and cumulative Dp427/Dp260/Dp140utr loss (n = 6) was statistically significant (P = 0.011). Visuomotor functioning was more impaired in patients with isolated Dp427 loss.\nThe role of cumulative loss of isoforms along with importance of loss of Dp140pc isoform was seen in our study. One patient with loss of Dp140utr isoform had intellectual impairment which is not commonly seen. Visuomotor functioning is more affected in more upstream mutations as shown in our study.", "Major advances in diagnostic technologies are offering unprecedented insight into the condition of the retina and beyond ocular disease. Digital images providing millions of morphological datasets can fast and non-invasively be analyzed in a comprehensive manner using artificial intelligence (AI). Methods based on machine learning (ML) and particularly deep learning (DL) are able to identify, localize and quantify pathological features in almost every macular and retinal disease. Convolutional neural networks thereby mimic the path of the human brain for object recognition through learning of pathological features from training sets, supervised ML, or even extrapolation from patterns recognized independently, unsupervised ML. The methods of AI-based retinal analyses are diverse and differ widely in their applicability, interpretability and reliability in different datasets and diseases. Fully automated AI-based systems have recently been approved for screening of diabetic retinopathy (DR). The overall potential of ML/DL includes screening, diagnostic grading as well as guidance of therapy with automated detection of disease activity, recurrences, quantification of therapeutic effects and identification of relevant targets for novel therapeutic approaches. Prediction and prognostic conclusions further expand the potential benefit of AI in retina which will enable personalized health care as well as large scale management and will empower the ophthalmologist to provide high quality diagnosis/therapy and successfully deal with the complexity of 21st century ophthalmology.", "Intelligence is an important quantitative trait associated with human cognitive ability. The genetic basis of intelligence remains unclear now. Utilizing the latest chromosomal enhancer maps of brain regions, we explored brain region related biological pathways associated with intelligence. Summary data was derived from a large scale genome-wide association study (GWAS) of human, involving 78,308 unrelated individuals from 13 cohorts. The chromosomal enhancer maps of 8 brain regions were then aligned with the GWAS summary data to obtain the association testing results of enhancer regions for intelligence. Gene set enrichment analysis was then conducted to identify the biological pathways associated with intelligence for 8 brain regions, respectively. A total of 178 KEGG pathways was analyzed in this study. We detected multiple biological pathways showing cross brain regions or brain region specific association signals for human intelligence. For instance, KEGG_SYSTEMIC_LUPUS_ERYTHEMATOSUS pathway presented association signals for intelligence across 8 brain regions (all P value\u202f<\u202f0.01). KEGG_GLYCOSPHINGOLIPID_BIOSYNTHESIS_GANGLIO_SERIES was detected for 5 brain regions. We also identified several brain region specific pathways, such as AMINO_SUGAR_AND_NUCLEOTIDE_SUGAR_METABOLISM for Germinal Matrix (P value\u202f=\u202f0.009) and FRUCTOSE_AND_MANNOSE_METABOLISM for Anterior Caudate (P value\u202f=\u202f0.005). Our study results provided novel clues for understanding the genetic mechanism of intelligence.", "As a tool of qualitative representation, conditional preference network (CP-net) has recently become a hot research topic in the field of artificial intelligence. The semantics of CP-nets does not restrict the generation of cycles, but the existence of the cycles would affect the property of CP-nets such as satisfaction and consistency. This paper attempts to use the feedback set problem theory including feedback vertex set (FVS) and feedback arc set (FAS) to cut cycles in CP-nets. Because of great time complexity of the problem in general, this paper defines a class of the parent vertices in a ring CP-nets firstly and then gives corresponding algorithm, respectively, based on FVS and FAS. Finally, the experiment shows that the running time and the expressive ability of the two methods are compared.", "Artificial intelligence or 'big data' comprises of algorithms which aid in decision making.

We aim to examine the differences in language used to describe male and female applicants within the SLOE narrative.\nInvited applicants to a 4-year academic EM residency program within a single application year with a SLOE were included in the sample. Exclusion criteria were SLOE of applicants from non-Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME) schools or first rotation SLOE not available for download. Data were collected on applicant gender, age, rotation grade, Alpha Omega Alpha designation, and medical school rank. The previously validated Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) program was used to analyze frequency of words within categories relevant to letters of recommendation. Descriptive statistics, t-tests, and chi-square tests were employed in analysis.\nOf 1,025 applicants within a single application year, 265 were invited to interview; 237 applicants had a first rotation SLOE available for analysis. There were no differences between male and female applicants for baseline characteristics. The median word count per SLOE narrative was 199; within the LIWC dictionary and user-defined categories, words within the categories of affiliation and ability appeared more frequently for female applicants.\nOur results with respect to the SLOE narrative reinforce prior research that letters of recommendation for female applicants highlight communal characteristics of teamwork, helpfulness, and compassion. Contrary to prior research, ability words highlighting intelligence and skill appeared with greater frequency for female applicants. No pervasive differences were found in other word categories. In this sample, the standardized format of the SLOE resulted in letters that were relatively free of gender bias.", "Data on the relationship between intelligence quotient (IQ) and violence perpetration are scarce and nationally representative data from the UK adult population is lacking. Therefore, our goal was to examine the relationship between IQ and violence perpetration using nationally representative community-based data from the UK.\nWe analyzed cross-sectional data from the 2007 Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey. IQ was estimated using the National Adult Reading Test (NART). Violence perpetration referred to being in a physical fight or having deliberately hit anyone in the past 5 years. We conducted logistic regression analysis to assess the association between IQ (exposure variable) and violence perpetration (outcome variable).\nThere were 6872 participants aged \u2a7e16 years included in this study. The prevalence of violence perpetration decreased linearly with increasing IQ [16.3% (IQ 70-79) v. 2.9% (IQ 120-129)]. After adjusting for demographic and behavioral factors, childhood adversity, and psychiatric morbidity, compared with those with IQ 120-129, IQ scores of 110-119, 100-109, 90-99, 80-89, and 70-79 were associated with 1.07 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.63-1.84], 1.90 (95% CI 1.12-3.22), 1.80 (95% CI 1.05-3.13), 2.36 (95% CI 1.32-4.22), and 2.25 (95% CI 1.26-4.01) times higher odds for violence perpetration, respectively.\nLower IQ was associated with violence perpetration in the UK general population. Further studies are warranted to assess how low IQ can lead to violence perpetration, and whether interventions are possible for this high-risk group.", "It is well known that children treated for cancer are at risk for cognitive and functional impairments. Such research is largely based on studies of late effects in school-aged or older children. However, far less is known about executive function weaknesses in preschool-aged children treated for cancer. Thus, the aim of this study was to examine executive functioning in a clinically referred sample of young oncology patients, and its association with broader domains of functioning. Data from 61 young children with cancer, who were referred for clinical cognitive evaluations, were abstracted and included in this study. Patients were 5.00\u00a0years of age (SD\u00a0=\u00a00.72) at assessment, 54.1% male, and two-thirds (63.9%) had been treated for brain tumors. Most executive functions were significantly discrepant from the mean, with 47.5% of preschoolers having parent-reported working memory concerns within the clinically significant range. There were no differences in executive functioning based on diagnosis or treatment status. Parent-reported executive functioning was strongly correlated with global intelligence and adaptive functioning, with some indices also associated with nonverbal problem solving and pre-academic skills. Ultimately, results indicate the presence of emerging weaknesses in executive functioning in young children with cancer, and add to a growing body of literature highlighting the potential cognitive and behavioral risks associated with a cancer diagnosis in early childhood.", "Neurorobots are robots whose control has been modeled after some aspect of the brain. Since the brain is so closely coupled to the body and situated in the environment, Neurorobots can be a powerful tool for studying neural function in a holistic fashion. It may also be a means to develop autonomous systems that have some level of biological intelligence. The present article provides my perspective on this field, points out some of the landmark events, and discusses its future potential.", "People with superior mathematical abilities turn out to have an autism spectrum disorder more often than others do. The empathising-systemising theory proposes that this link is mediated by these individuals' stronger tendency to systemise (detect patterns, derive rules), along with the fact that mathematics is the perfect example of a rule-based, lawful system. This account, however, requires that individuals from the general population who are more inclined to systemise be better at maths than those who are less inclined to do so. Based on the scant available evidence, this has been argued not to be the case. The data presented here show, for the first time, that systemising tendencies do predict both self-assessed maths skills (201 participants) and mathematical intelligence (151 participants), before and after controlling for nonmathematical intelligence, sex, and occupation (social sciences vs biological/physical fields). These findings support the empathising-systemising theory and the \"hyper-systemising\" explanation of autism.", "Government policies on commercial motorcycle crash prevention are often not driven by data in terms of mental health risks. In this cross-sectional study, data was obtained from 508 commercial motorcyclists (CMs) in Ibadan, Nigeria on psychological distress, personality, suicidality, impulsivity, substance use and Intelligence Quotient, to determine the mental health correlates of road crash involvement. One-month and 12-month accident rates were 7.9 and 28.9% respectively. One-month crash involvement was independently associated with helmet non-use (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.1-4.7, p\u2009=\u20090.03) and poor knowledge of road signs (OR 2.5, 95% CI 1.2-5.3, p\u2009=\u20090.02). The odds of 12-month crash involvement was increased among lifetime users of alcohol (OR 2.0, 95% CI 1.3-3.0, p\u2009=\u20090.001) and those with fewer than two children (OR 2.0, 95% CI 1.2-3.3, p\u2009=\u20090.006), but was reduced among riders with primary school education (OR 0.2, 95% CI 0.1-0.7, p\u2009=\u20090.007). Crash involvement rate in this population is high. Results from the study do not support routine psychiatric evaluation for traffic offenders, but are more in favour of safety education and traffic law enforcement.", "The current study evaluated the relationship between positive and negative emotions, trait emotional intelligence (trait EI) and difficulties in career decision-making. We examined whether trait EI could predict career indecisiveness, a type of career decision-making difficulty, over and above the \"Big Five\" personality traits. We also examined the mechanism through which trait EI affected career indecisiveness by investigating the mediating role of positive and negative emotions. Survey data were collected from a sample of 600 undergraduate students in a university in southwest United States, who completed questionnaires measuring trait EI, positive emotions, negative emotions, personality traits, and career indecisiveness. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses indicated that trait EI accounted for a significant proportion of the variance in career indecisiveness that was not explained by the \"Big Five\" personality traits. The parallel mediation analysis revealed that positive and negative emotions partially mediated the relationship between trait EI and career indecisiveness. Using the framework of Fredrickson's (2001) broaden and build theory of positive emotions, the study provides empirical evidence explaining the mechanism through which trait EI helps individuals cope better with challenging situations in life. Trait EI aids the elicitation of positive emotions and the down-regulation of negative emotions, which, in turn, broaden the range of thoughts and actions that come to mind, helping individuals function more effectively in the context of career decision-making. Implications for career counseling and opportunities for further research are discussed.", "Reports an error in \"Revisiting Carroll's survey of factor-analytic studies: Implications for the clinical assessment of intelligence\" by Nicholas F.

(The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2018-23627-001.) John Carroll's three-stratum theory (and the decades of research behind its development) is foundational to the contemporary practice of intellectual assessment. The present study addresses some limitations of Carroll's work: specification, reproducibility with more modern methods, and interpretive relevance. We reanalyzed select data sets from Carroll's survey of factor analytic studies using confirmatory factor analysis as well as modern indices of interpretive relevance. For the majority of data sets, we found that Carroll likely extracted too many factors representing Stratum II abilities. Moreover, almost all factors representing Stratum II abilities had little-to-no interpretive relevance above and beyond that of general intelligence. We conclude by discussing the implications of this research with respect to the interpretive relevance and clinical utility of scores reflecting cognitive abilities at all strata of the three-stratum theory and offer some directions for future research.

This study examined sex differences in clinically identified (Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule) restricted and repetitive behavior symptoms using the largest known sample (N\u2009=\u20091024) of age-matched and intelligence quotient-matched female and male children with autism spectrum disorder. More similarities than differences were observed; however, younger higher functioning and older lower functioning females presented reduced rates on the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule restricted and repetitive behavior subcategory unusually repetitive/excessive, stereotyped behaviors compared to similar males. These findings identify key restricted and repetitive behavior similarities and differences among young females and males with autism spectrum disorder and emphasize the need for a deeper understanding of the female autism phenotype.", "Mathematics rules the world of science. Innovative technologies based on mathematics have paved the way for implementation of novel strategies in assisted reproduction. Ascertaining efficient embryo selection in order to secure optimal pregnancy rates remains the focus of the in vitro fertilization scientific community and the strongest driver behind innovative approaches. This scoping review aims to describe and analyze complex models based on mathematics for embryo selection, devices, and software most widely employed in the IVF laboratory and algorithms in the service of the cutting-edge technology of artificial intelligence. Despite their promising nature, the practicing embryologist is the one ultimately responsible for the success of the IVF laboratory and thus the one to approve embracing pioneering technologies in routine practice.

Complete tumor and cell-free DNA profiling using next-generation sequencing, proteomic and RNA analysis, and immune mechanisms should to be taken into consideration and accurate bioinformatic analysis is essential to optimize patient's treatment. Areas covered: The challenges and opportunities of conducting clinical trials in precision oncology are summarized. Expert commentary: Precision medicine has significantly changed the diagnostic and therapeutic landscape of cancer. Successful implementation of precision medicine requires translational and bioinformatics infrastructure to support optimization of treatment selection. Targeted therapy, immunotherapy, T-cell therapy alone or in combination with cytotoxic or other effective therapeutic strategies and innovative clinical trials with adaptive design should be offered to all patients. Data sharing and 'N-of-1' models hold the promise to optimize the treatment of individual patients and expedite drug approval for rare alterations and tumor types. Artificial intelligence will facilitate accurate utilization of sequencing data to perform algorithm analysis. Collaboration of healthcare providers with pharmaceutical and biotechnical companies, scientific organizations, and governmental regulatory agencies have a crucial role in curing cancer.", "Soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infection leads to malnutrition and anemia, and has been linked to impaired child development. Previous research on this topic is limited and mostly conducted in school-age children. The goal of this study was to determine the effect of the number of detected STH infections between one and two years of age on subsequent cognitive and verbal abilities, in a cohort of preschool children.\nA longitudinal cohort study was conducted in 880 children in Iquitos, Peru between September 2011 and July 2016. Children were recruited at one year of age and followed up at 18 months and then annually between two and five years of age. STH infection was measured with the Kato-Katz technique or the direct smear technique. Child development was measured with the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development-III at the one to three-year visits and with the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence-III at the four and five-year visits. Hierarchical multivariable linear regression models were used to account for the repeated outcome measures for each child and Bayesian latent class analysis was used to adjust for STH misclassification. Children found infected with any STH infection between one and two years of age had lower cognitive scores between two and five years of age (between group score differences (95% credible intervals) for infected once, and infected two or three times, compared to never infected: -4.31 (-10.64, -0.14) and -3.70 (-10.11, -0.11), respectively). Similar results were found for Ascaris infection and for verbal scores.\nAn association was found between having been infected with Ascaris or any STH between one and two years of age and lower cognitive and verbal abilities later in childhood. These results suggest that targeting children for STH control as of one year of age is particularly important.", "Deep learning is one of the subsets of machine learning that is widely used in artificial intelligence (AI) field such as natural language processing and machine vision. The deep convolution neural network (DCNN) extracts high-level concepts from low-level features and it is appropriate for large volumes of data. In fact, in deep learning, the high-level concepts are defined by low-level features. Previously, in optimization algorithms, the accuracy achieved for network training was less and high-cost function. In this regard, in this study, AdaptAhead optimization algorithm was developed for learning DCNN with robust architecture in relation to the high volume data. The proposed optimization algorithm was validated in multi-modality MR images of BRATS 2015 and BRATS 2016 data sets. Comparison of the proposed optimization algorithm with other commonly used methods represents the improvement of the performance of the proposed optimization algorithm on the relatively large dataset. Using the Dice similarity metric, we report accuracy results on the BRATS 2015 and BRATS 2016 brain tumor segmentation challenge dataset. Results showed that our proposed algorithm is significantly more accurate than other methods as a result of its deep and hierarchical extraction.", "Recent public disclosures on attacks targeting the power industry showed that savvy attackers are now capable of occulting themselves from conventional rule-based network intrusion detection systems (IDS), bringing about serious threats. In order to leverage the work of rule-based IDS, this paper presents an artificially intelligent physical-model-checking intrusion detection framework capable of detecting tampered-with control commands from control centers of power grids. Unlike the work presented in the literature, the work in this paper utilizes artificial intelligence (AI) to learn the load flow characteristics of the power system and benefits from the fast responses of the AI to decode and understand contents of network packets. The output of the AI is processed through an expert system to verify that incoming control commands do not violate the physical system operational constraints and do not put the power system in an insecure state. The proposed content-aware IDS is tested in simulation on a 14-bus IEEE benchmark system. Experimental verification on a small power system, with an IEC 61850 network architecture is also carried out. The results showed the accuracy of the proposed framework in successfully detecting malicious and/or erroneous control commands.", "This study investigates the predictive value of impulsivity traits (as measured by the UPPS-P impulsive behaviour scale) and relevant covariates (sociodemographics, gambling severity, dysphoric mood, other potentially addictive behaviours, and non-verbal intelligence) with regard to treatment dropout and level of adherence to therapy guidelines and instructions in patients with gambling disorder. Sixty-six patients seeking treatment for gambling disorder, and recruited to participate in a larger protocol (G-Brain), were initially assessed in impulsivity traits and relevant covariates in the first six months after admission. Of these, 24 patients dropped out (DO) and 42 patients remained in therapy (NDO) during the subsequent 6-month follow-up period. A multivariate analysis of impulsivity subscales suggested prospective differences between DO and NDO, with affect-driven dimensions (positive and negative urgency) seemingly driving these differences. Among these, only positive urgency independently predicted a slight increase in the drop-out probability. In the NDO group, a higher degree of adherence to therapy was independently predicted by lower sensation-seeking scores and stronger awareness of gambling-related problems. Results suggest the presence of affect-driven impulsivity traits as dropout predictors in patients with gambling disorder. Awareness of gambling-related problems and lower sensation-seeking enhanced compliance with therapeutic guidelines and instructions.\nEste estudio investiga el valor predictivo de la impulsividad como rasgo (evaluada con la escala de conducta impulsiva UPPS-P) y de covariados relevantes (variables sociodemogr\u00e1ficas, severidad del juego de azar, estado de \u00e1nimo disf\u00f3rico, otras conductas adictivas e inteligencia no verbal), con respecto al abandono del tratamiento y los niveles de cumplimiento de las prescripciones terap\u00e9uticas en pacientes con trastorno por juego de azar. Sesenta y seis pacientes con este trastorno, participantes del proyecto G-Brain, fueron evaluados inicialmente en impulsividad rasgo y en los covariados mencionados. Dicha evaluaci\u00f3n se realiz\u00f3 durante los seis primeros meses desde el inicio de su tratamiento. En el seguimiento realizado a los 6 meses, 24 pacientes hab\u00edan abandonado (grupo ABD) y 42 continuaban el tratamiento (grupo NABD). Los an\u00e1lisis multivariados con las subescalas de impulsividad mostraron diferencias prospectivas entre ambos grupos. Aparentemente, estas diferencias son atribuibles a las dimensiones afectivas de impulsividad (urgencias positiva y negativa). Entre ambas dimensiones, solo la urgencia positiva fue un predictor independiente de un ligero incremento en la probabilidad de abandono. Dentro del grupo NABD, un mayor grado de adherencia terap\u00e9utica vino predicho, de manera independiente, tanto por una baja b\u00fasqueda de sensaciones como por una mayor conciencia de los problemas vinculados al juego. Estos resultados sugieren que los rasgos de impulsividad de origen afectivo son predictores de abandono del tratamiento en pacientes con trastorno por juego. La conciencia de problemas asociados al juego de azar y una baja b\u00fasqueda de sensaciones predisponen a una mayor adherencia a las prescripciones terap\u00e9uticas.", "Craniofacial dysmorphism recognition is the first step in diagnosing most genetic syndromes. However, the number of genetic syndromes is enormous, and the specific facial features are difficult to memorize. For clinical practice, recent advances in artificial intelligence can be of use. One such tool, Face2Gene (FDNA, Inc., Boston, MA), is an innovative free group of applications, that helps clinicians recognize possible genetic syndromes from patients' facial two-dimensional photos. The initial data set used to train this technology consisted primarily of Caucasian patients. Because ethnic differences affect patients' facial features, the recognition probability in Asian patients may be limited. Our aim was to test the technology's recognition probability on Thai children with Down Syndrome (DS) as compared to Thai children without DS (non-DS). Two separate control groups of Thai non-DS children, either unaffected or having other syndromes, were included. Frontal photographs were obtained from all the participants. All 30 children with DS were recognized as DS in the top 10 syndrome-matches (100% sensitivity), and 27 were in the first ranking of suggested syndromes. Eighteen non-DS were recognized as DS (87.2% specificity) with an accuracy of 89%. We present a scientific basis for this novel tool, useful in the clinic where patients are of a different ethnicity unfamiliar to the evaluator. However, Face2Gene cannot be considered a replacement for clinicians' knowledge of phenotypes. Further studies on other genetic syndromes/ethnicities being identified by software algorithms are needed.", "To evaluate seizure outcome in patients receiving surgery for chronic medically intractable mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) and analyze its possible predictors.\nThis retrospective study was conducted in patients with chronic medically intractable MTLE undergoing anterior temporal lobectomy (ATL) or selective amygdalohippocampectomy (SAH) in our department between September, 2011 and October, 2013. The patients were followed up for 3.5 to 5.5 years, during which the seizure outcome was evaluated according to Engel's classification. The clinical data were collected from the patients to identify the possible predictors that affected the outcome of the patients using Mann-Whitney U test or Kruskal-Wallis test.\nAtotal of 34 patients were included in this study with a definite diagnosis of chronic medically intractable MTLE after preoperative noninvasive and invasive evaluation. In 4 of these patients, invasive EEG monitoring confirmed that epileptic discharges originated from the bilateral mesial temporal lobe, and hence surgical resection of the epileptogenic zone was not performed. The other 30 patients underwent surgical resection of the epileptogenic zone with ALT or SAH, and favorable outcomes were achieved in 23 (76.7%) of the patients. Of the 7 (23.3%) patients with poor outcomes, 6 patients presented with typical automatism and aura with frequent secondary generalized tonic-clonic seizure, and the other one patient exhibited impaired intelligence. Statistical analysis suggested that the patients without a special disease history (trauma, febrile seizure, or encephalitis) tended to have a more favorable seizure outcome.\nSurgical interventions can achieve good therapeutic effect on chronic medically intractable MTLE, and patients without a special disease history may have more favorable outcomes after the surgery.

Statistical analysis suggested that the patients without a special disease history (trauma, febrile seizure, or encephalitis) tended to have a more favorable seizure outcome.\nSurgical interventions can achieve good therapeutic effect on chronic medically intractable MTLE, and patients without a special disease history may have more favorable outcomes after the surgery. SAH via the superior temporal sulcus approach can be a better surgical option for intractable MTLE.", "Dystrophin is an important protein within the central nervous system. The absence of dystrophin, characterizing Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), is associated with brain related comorbidities such as neurodevelopmental (e.g., cognitive and behavioural) deficits and epilepsy. Especially mutations in the downstream part of the DMD gene affecting the dystrophin isoforms Dp140 and Dp71 are found to be associated with cognitive deficits. However, the function of Dp140 is currently not well understood and its expression pattern has previously been implicated to be developmentally regulated. Therefore, we evaluated Dp140 and Dp71 expression in human hippocampi in relation to cognitive functioning in patients with drug-resistant temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and post-mortem controls. Hippocampal samples obtained as part of epilepsy surgery were quantitatively analyzed by Western blot and correlations with neuropsychological test results (i.e., memory and intelligence) were examined. First, we demonstrated that the expression of Dp140 does not appear to differ across different ages throughout adulthood. Second, we identified an inverse correlation between memory loss (i.e., verbal and visual memory), but not intelligence (i.e., neither verbal nor performance), and hippocampal Dp140 expression. Finally, patients with TLE appeared to have similar Dp140 expression levels compared to post-mortem controls without neurological disease. Dp140 may thus have a function in normal cognitive (i.e., episodic memory) processes.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) has transformed key aspects of human life. Machine learning (ML), which is a subset of AI wherein machines autonomously acquire information by extracting patterns from large databases, has been increasingly used within the medical community, and specifically within the domain of cardiovascular diseases. In this review, we present a brief overview of ML methodologies that are used for the construction of inferential and predictive data-driven models. We highlight several domains of ML application such as echocardiography, electrocardiography, and recently developed non-invasive imaging modalities such as coronary artery calcium scoring and coronary computed tomography angiography. We conclude by reviewing the limitations associated with contemporary application of ML algorithms within the cardiovascular disease field.", "Psychoses, especially schizophrenia, are often preceded by cognitive deficits and psychosis risk states. Altered metabolic profiles have been found in schizophrenia. However, the associations between metabolic profiles and poorer cognitive performance and psychosis risk in the population remain to be determined.\nDetailed molecular profiles were measured for up to 8976 individuals from two general population-based prospective birth cohorts: the Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1986 (NFBC 1986) and the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC). A high-throughput nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy platform was used to quantify 70 metabolic measures at age 15-16 years in the NFBC 1986 and at ages 15 and 17 years in ALSPAC. Psychosis risk was assessed using the PROD-screen questionnaire at age 15-16 years in the NFBC 1986 or the psychotic-like symptoms assessment at age 17 years in ALSPAC. Cognitive measures included academic performance at age 16 years in both cohorts and general intelligence and executive function in ALSPAC. Logistic regression measured cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between metabolic measures and psychosis risk and cognitive performance, controlling for important covariates.\nSeven metabolic measures, primarily fatty acid (FA) measures, showed cross-sectional associations with general cognitive performance, four across both cohorts (low density lipoprotein diameter, monounsaturated FA ratio, omega-3 ratio and docosahexaenoic acid ratio), even after controlling for important mental and physical health covariates. Psychosis risk showed minimal metabolic associations.\nFA ratios may be important in marking risk for cognitive deficits in adolescence. Further research is needed to clarify whether these biomarkers could be causal and thereby possible targets for intervention.", "The aim of this study was to develop and validate a decision support model using a machine learning algorithm to predict treatment success after single session shock wave lithotripsy in ureteral stone cases.\nOf the 1,803 patients treated with shock wave lithotripsy we selected those with ureteral stones who had preoperative computerized tomography available. Treatment success after single session shock wave lithotripsy was defined as freedom from stones or residual stone fragments less than 2 mm long on computerized tomography or plain x-ray of the kidneys, ureters and bladder 2 weeks later. Decision tree analysis was done using a machine learning algorithm to identify relevant parameters. A decision support model was developed to calculate the probability of treatment success.\nA total of 791 patients were enrolled in study. Mean \u00b1 SD stone length was 5.9 \u00b1 2.3 mm and mean stone volume was 89.3 \u00b1 140.0 mm3. The overall treatment success rate after SWL was 64.4% (509 cases). The rate for upper, middle and lower ureter stones was 59.8%, 65.5% and 69.6%, respectively. On decision tree analysis the top 3 performance criteria factors were volume, length and HU. Decision models were constructed with all possible combinations of factors. The model with 15 factors had greater than 92% accuracy and an average ROC AUC of 0.951.\nWe applied a machine learning algorithm, a subfield of artificial intelligence, to predict the outcome after single session shock wave lithotripsy for ureteral stones. A 92.29% accurate decision model was developed with 15 factors and an average ROC AUC of 0.951.", "The study of electroencephalography (EEG) signals is not a new topic. However, the analysis of human emotions upon exposure to music considered as important direction. Although distributed in various academic databases, research on this concept is limited. To extend research in this area, the researchers explored and analysed the academic articles published within the mentioned scope. Thus, in this paper a systematic review is carried out to map and draw the research scenery for EEG human emotion into a taxonomy. Systematically searched all articles about the, EEG human emotion based music in three main databases: ScienceDirect, Web of Science and IEEE Xplore from 1999 to 2016. These databases feature academic studies that used EEG to measure brain signals, with a focus on the effects of music on human emotions. The screening and filtering of articles were performed in three iterations. In the first iteration, duplicate articles were excluded. In the second iteration, the articles were filtered according to their titles and abstracts, and articles outside of the scope of our domain were excluded. In the third iteration, the articles were filtered by reading the full text and excluding articles outside of the scope of our domain and which do not meet our criteria. Based on inclusion and exclusion criteria, 100 articles were selected and separated into five classes. The first class includes 39 articles (39%) consists of emotion, wherein various emotions are classified using artificial intelligence (AI). The second class includes 21 articles (21%) is composed of studies that use EEG techniques. This class is named 'brain condition'. The third class includes eight articles (8%) is related to feature extraction, which is a step before emotion classification. That this process makes use of classifiers should be noted. However, these articles are not listed under the first class because these eight articles focus on feature extraction rather than classifier accuracy. The fourth class includes 26 articles (26%) comprises studies that compare between or among two or more groups to identify and discover human emotion-based EEG. The final class includes six articles (6%) represents articles that study music as a stimulus and its impact on brain signals. Then, discussed the five main categories which are action types, age of the participants, and number size of the participants, duration of recording and listening to music and lastly countries or authors' nationality that published these previous studies. it afterward recognizes the main characteristics of this promising area of science in: motivation of using EEG process for measuring human brain signals, open challenges obstructing employment and recommendations to improve the utilization of EEG process.", "Given the many instances of violence and crime that occur as a consequence of psychopathy, it is vital to find those variables that can reduce the expression of such behaviors. In this regard, one potentially useful variable is that known as Emotional Intelligence (EI) or the ability to perceive, use, understand, and regulate emotions. EI has been categorized according to three main approaches: performance-based ability, self-report ability, and self-report mixed models. Given the emotional deficits of the psychopathic population, EI could be a protective factor. Several studies have analyzed the relationship between EI and psychopathy, but the results are unclear. This disparity may be due to the EI model employed to measure EI. The aim of our research is to systematically review the relationship between the different models of EI and psychopathy, both in the total and clinical/inmate sample. We searched Scopus, Pubmed, and PsicINFO to find relevant articles. Twenty-nine eligible studies were found. They were divided according to the model of EI and the sample used. The results for the total sample differ according to the measure of EI: when the performance-based ability model is used, the majority of studies find a negative relationship between EI and psychopathy. When using self-reports, the results are inconsistent. The findings with the clinical/inmate sample are in the same direction as the total sample. In conclusion, the results suggest that higher EI abilities measured through performance-based ability models-but not through self-reports-are related to lower psychopathy deficits. Limitations and clinical implications are discussed.", "Cocaine use has been reported for more than 2500 years, but along this period of time its damage to society in general became evident. Nowadays, cocaine is classified as an illicit drug and studies which give support to drug enforcement institutions, particularly in the area of police intelligence, are very relevant. Often, trafficked cocaine is not traded in its pure form, but mixed with adulterants and diluents. In the analysis of seized samples, the reference method is based on gas chromatography, however the interest in the use of vibrational spectroscopy has increased. This work aims at developing a method for determination of the concentrations of cocaine, adulterants and diluents in cocaine samples employing Attenuated Total Reflectance Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) associated with Multivariate Curve Resolution with Alternating Least-Squares (MCR-ALS). A total of 6 adulterants, 3 diluents, 2 forms of cocaine (base and hydrochloride) were determined and the method developed based on 55 synthetic mixtures prepared according to a mixture design and 20 seized samples. For validation purposes 708 seized samples and 9 synthetic mixtures were analyzed. The results proved to be satisfactory, showing that the proposed method has a great potential in the classification of the chemical form of cocaine, identification of adulterants, diluents and cocaine in seized samples, as well as providing an estimate for their concentration.", "Childhood sexual abuse of boys was examined in a longitudinal cohort in South Africa, with data on abuse collected at six age points between 11 and 18 years. Potential personal and social vulnerability of male sexual abuse victims was explored and mental health outcomes of sexually abused boys were examined at age 22-23 years. Reports of all sexual activity - touching, oral and penetrative sex - increased with age and sexual coercion decreased with age. Almost all sexual activity at 11 years of age was coerced, with the highest rates of coercion occurring between 13 and14 years of age; 45% of reports of coerced touching were reported at age 14, 41 percent of coerced oral sex at age 13, and 31% of coerced penetrative sex at age 14. Sexual coercion was perpetrated most frequently by similar aged peers, and although gender of the assailant was less often reported, it can be presumed that perpetration is by males. Boys who experienced childhood sexual abuse tended to be smaller (shorter) and from poorer families. No relationships to measured childhood intelligence, pubertal stage, marital status of mother or presence of the father were found. There was no significant association between reports of childhood sexual abuse and mental health in adulthood and when personal and social vulnerabilities were taken into account.", "To examine the association between maternal intelligence quotient (IQ) and early childhood motor development and whether maternal education mediates this relationship.\nData were collected prospectively in the Ma'anshan Birth Cohort study. Maternal IQ was assessed using the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised by China (WAIS-RC). Information on baseline characteristics and maternal education was obtained from questionnaires and medical records. The study outcome was motor development evaluated at 18\u2009months by the Third Edition of Ages and Stages Questionnaire. Logistic regression analyses and mediation analyses were used.\nOf 2739 valid subjects (84% follow-up), the rate of developmental delay was 3.1% in the gross motor domain and 6.2% in the fine motor domain. The mean value for maternal IQ was 96.2 (standard deviation 10.6). About 40.3% of the mothers had secondary education or less, while 59.7% had a college education. Mothers with higher IQ had a significantly higher educational level and had children with better motor development. Maternal education significantly mediated the association between maternal IQ and fine motor development. There was a direct effect of maternal IQ on gross motor development, but the mediation effect of maternal education was not found.\nMaternal IQ was associated with motor development. Maternal education played an important role in reducing the disparities in fine motor development among children of different maternal IQs.", "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disease, which has attracted more and more attention. Many artificial intelligence methods have been used for the diagnosis of PD. In this study, an enhanced fuzzy k-nearest neighbor (FKNN) method for the early detection of PD based upon vocal measurements was developed. The proposed method, an evolutionary instance-based learning approach termed CBFO-FKNN, was developed by coupling the chaotic bacterial foraging optimization with Gauss mutation (CBFO) approach with FKNN. The integration of the CBFO technique efficiently resolved the parameter tuning issues of the FKNN. The effectiveness of the proposed CBFO-FKNN was rigorously compared to those of the PD datasets in terms of classification accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and AUC (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve). The simulation results indicated the proposed approach outperformed the other five FKNN models based on BFO, particle swarm optimization, Genetic algorithms, fruit fly optimization, and firefly algorithm, as well as three advanced machine learning methods including support vector machine (SVM), SVM with local learning-based feature selection, and kernel extreme learning machine in a 10-fold cross-validation scheme. The method presented in this paper has a very good prospect, which will bring great convenience to the clinicians to make a better decision in the clinical diagnosis.", "To compare the quality of life, areas of social, emotional, behavioural and mental problems and family functionality of gifted children and children of normal intelligence.\nThe study included 49 gifted children aged 9-18 years and 56 age and gender-matched healthy children of normal intelligence. The Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children-Present and Lifetime Version (K-SADS-PL), and the Children's Depression Rating Scale were applied to all the cases. The Quality of Life Scale for Children, the Depression Scale for Children, the Trait-State Anxiety Inventory, and the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire- Adolescent Form were completed by all the participants. All the parents completed the Family Evaluation Scale, the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire- Parents Form and the Parents Form of the Quality of Life Scale for Children.\nCompared to children of normal intelligence, gifted children described themselves as more inattentive and lively, social functionality was reported to be low and they had a worse perception of their physical health status. Gifted boys were determined to have more depressive symptoms than gifted girls. The parents of boys of normal intelligence reported lower academic performance than the parents of giftedboys. This difference was not determined for girls between the cases and comparative groups.\nAll the findings obtained in this study suggest that gifted children are at risk in respect of mental health. Therefore, to be able to become healthy adults in a biopsychosocial aspect, it is important for the future of gifted children that this status can be identified at an early age, that they can receive appropriate education, that support and counselling are provided for emotional needs and that parents and teachers are fully informed.", "This study determined whether cognitive outcomes differed between very preterm (VPT) and extremely preterm (EPT) children who were monolingual or multilingual when they reached the corrected ages of two and five years.\nThe data were collected at the Emma Children's Hospital, Amsterdam, The Netherlands, as part of our national neonatal follow-up programme and comprised 325 VPT/EPT children born between January 1, 2007 and January 1, 2012. The study used the Third Editions of the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development and the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence.\nWe compared 234 monolingual children, 65 multilingual children who spoke Dutch and at least one foreign language at home and 26 multilingual children who didn't speak Dutch at home. The best performers on the cognitive scale at two years of age and the verbal subscales at five years of age were the monolingual children, followed by the children who spoke Dutch and at least one foreign language at home, then the children who only spoke foreign languages at home.\nIn our study cohort from The Netherlands, multilingualism lowered the cognitive and verbal outcomes of VPT/EPT children at the corrected ages of two and five years.", "Proper nutritional status in early childhood makes it possible for children to achieve their genetically-determined growth potential and intelligence. A child's nutritional status is due to economic, cultural, psychosocial and geographic factors. The present study aims to check whether the nutritional status of preschoolers differs depending on their place of residence.\nIn order to achieve this goal we used 24-h dietary recalls to assess the children's diet based on interviews with 530 mothers of preschool children from five different regions of Poland. Moreover, the children's BMIs were calculated.\nWe found differences in the level of anthropometric indicators, diet structure and what percentage of the estimated average requirement for energy was met depending on the region where the children live. Youngsters from the western region of Poland had significantly higher BMIs than those from other regions. What is more, the percentage of meeting the estimated average requirement for energy and the percentage of calories from carbohydrates was higher among children from the western region, as compared with preschoolers from other areas of the country. The amount of fats and protein in the diet of children from western Poland, in turn, was significantly lower as compared with the diet of their peers from other regions.\nThe present study provides evidence that the nutritional status of children should be analyzed in the context of their place of residence. Thus, the differences between regions and their impact on the health status of their inhabitants should be taken into account when designing preventive or corrective measures.\nW\u0142a\u015bciwy stan od\u017cywienia we wczesnym okresie \u017cycia pozwala osi\u0105gn\u0105\u0107 genetycznie uwarunkowany potencja\u0142 wzrostowy oraz poziom inteligencji.

Stress among students has been linked with adverse physical and psychological health. In addition to the common stressors associated with post-secondary education, sources of stress for students in the helping professions include balancing academic and clinical demands. Previous research indicates perceived stress levels are correlated with emotional intelligence (EI) and with the coping strategies employed by students.\nThe aim of this study was to examine (1) the relationship between EI and perceived stress, and (2) the potential mediating role of coping responses.\nA cross-sectional survey design was employed.\nParticipants were recruited from a public university in the United States.\nA sample of 203 undergraduate and graduate students majoring in psychology, nursing, and social work was recruited.\nParticipants were recruited on-campus and through campus online resources and completed an online survey or a paper-and-pencil version of the survey. Descriptive statistics and mediation analyses were used to test the study hypotheses.\nHigher EI was associated with lower perceived stress, and this association was partially mediated by both adaptive and maladaptive coping responses. Higher EI was associated with greater use of adaptive coping and lower use of maladaptive coping, and these, in turn, were negatively and positively (respectively) associated with perceived stress.\nThe findings suggest that interventions aimed at increasing emotional intelligence may help to reduce perceived stress for students in the helping disciplines.", "As scholars have predicted and researchers have now shown, we are entering an age of global artificial intelligence (AI) convergence. Health care is just one area in which AI is gaining a foothold, as evidenced by two parallel conferences held in March 2018 in Las Vegas, Nevada. The first of these was the annual meeting of the Hospital Information and Management Systems Society, attended by nearly 45,000 participants; the second was a more focused, engineering-oriented conference on biomedical health informatics and biosensor networks, attended by about 450. Straddling those two meetings, IEEE Pulse held its second IEEE Pulse on Stage event, focusing (not surprisingly) on the use of AI in health care (Figure 1).", "Accumulating evidence support that complete cytoreduction (CC) at the time of secondary cytoreductive surgery (SCS) improves survival in patients affected by recurrent ovarian cancer (ROC). Here, we aimed to determine whether artificial intelligence (AI) might be useful in weighting the importance of clinical variables predicting CC and survival.\nThis is a retrospective study evaluating 194 patients having SCS for ROC. Using artificial neuronal network (ANN) analysis was estimated the importance of different variables, used in predicting CC and survival. ANN simulates a biological neuronal system. Like neurons, ANN acquires knowledge through a learning-phase process and allows weighting the importance of covariates, thus establishing how much a variable influences a multifactor phenomenon.\nOverall, 82.9% of patients had CC at the time of SCS. Using ANN, we observed that the 3 main factors driving the ability of achieve CC included: disease-free interval (DFI) (importance: 0.231), retroperitoneal recurrence (importance: 0.178), residual disease at primary surgical treatment (importance: 0.138), and International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage at presentation (importance: 0.088). Looking at connections between different covariates and overall survival (OS), we observed that DFI is the most important variable influencing OS (importance: 0.306). Other important variables included: CC (importance: 0.217), and FIGO stage at presentation (importance: 0.100).\nAccording to our results, DFI should be considered as the most important factor predicting both CC and OS. Further studies are needed to estimate the clinical utility of AI in providing help in decision making process.", "The discovery of new materials can bring enormous societal and technological progress. In this context, exploring completely the large space of potential materials is computationally intractable. Here, we review methods for achieving inverse design, which aims to discover tailored materials from the starting point of a particular desired functionality. Recent advances from the rapidly growing field of artificial intelligence, mostly from the subfield of machine learning, have resulted in a fertile exchange of ideas, where approaches to inverse molecular design are being proposed and employed at a rapid pace. Among these, deep generative models have been applied to numerous classes of materials: rational design of prospective drugs, synthetic routes to organic compounds, and optimization of photovoltaics and redox flow batteries, as well as a variety of other solid-state materials.", "Spontaneous low-frequency oscillations in different frequency bands have diverse physiological meanings. The amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) and functional connectivity (FC) in different frequency bands in Benign Childhood Epilepsy with Centrotemporal Spikes (BECTS) are unknown and worth exploring.\nResting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data were collected in 51 drug-na\u00efve BECTS patients and 76 healthy controls. The ALFF was calculated for the typical (0.01 - 0.08\u202fHz), slow-5 (0.01-0.027\u202fHz), slow-4 (0.027-0.073\u202fHz), and slow-3 (0.073-0.198\u202fHz) frequency bands. The bilateral precuneus/posterior cingulate cortex (PCU/PCC) showed a common alteration of ALFF in different frequency bands, and was selected as the seed for calculating FC per voxel.\nIn the typical band, BECTS patients showed increased ALFF in the left rolandic operculum and the right pre/postcentral gyrus, and decreased ALFF in the bilateral PCU/PCC, some of which were shared by the slow-5, slow-4, and slow-3 bands. Decreased ALFF in the left angular gyrus was also found in the slow-3 band. Only the bilateral PCU/PCC showed a frequency-dependent correlation with the total seizure frequency and full-scale intelligence quotient. Regions having degenerated FC with the bilateral PCU/PCC in BECTS patients were mainly in the left prefrontal cortex and bilateral anterior cingulate cortex for the typical and slow-5 bands, and in the bilateral temporal limbic system and striatum for the slow-4 and slow-3 bands.\nAlteration of the ALFF and FC differed with distinct frequency bands. Therefore, employing different frequency bands would provide more meaningful findings for BECTS patients.", "This study examined the impact of fluctuations in metabolic control on the intelligence quotient (IQ) of children and adolescents with early, continuously treated phenylketonuria (PKU).\nThis was a clinic-based study carried out at University Hospital Munster, Germany, from 2015 to 2017. We investigated 49 patients (28 boys) with early treated PKU, who were aged 6-18 years with a mean age of 11.2 \u00b1 4.1 years. All the patients were on a continuous phenylalanine-restricted diet. Of the 49 patients, 29 (18 boys) had classic PKU and 21 patients (11 girls) had mild PKU. The patients' blood phenylalanine levels were assessed every week for 26 weeks and analysed for fluctuations, indicated by the standard deviation of the individual blood phenylalanine levels. We also assessed the concurrent Full Scale IQ (FSIQ) of the patients.\nIn patients with classic PKU, FSIQ was negatively correlated with blood phenylalanine levels, but not with level fluctuations. In patients with mild PKU, FSIQ was not correlated with blood phenylalanine levels, but was negatively correlated with level fluctuations.\nThe blood phenylalanine levels of patients with mild PKU showed minor interindividual differences, which may have allowed fluctuations to exert a negative effect on the FSIQ.", "Effectively recognizing, identifying, and utilizing emotional stimuli is essential for successful social interactions, with deficits in these robustly identified as risk factors for offending. Psychological understanding of street gang membership is limited, particularly surrounding emotional dispositions distinguishing street gang from non-gang offenders. This study examined how street gang members compare with non-gang offenders on trait emotional intelligence (TEI), antisocial personality disorder (ASPD), callous-unemotional traits, anger rumination, and aggression. Recruited through volunteer sampling, participants included 73 (44 street gang and 29 non-gang) male offenders incarcerated at a U.K. Category C prison. Participants completed seven questionnaires assessing emotional dispositions, social desirability, and, consistent with the Eurogang definition, street gang membership. To compare participants' demographics and identify the predictors of street gang membership, chi-square and discriminant function analyses were conducted. With a significant discriminant function, \u039b = .80, \u03c72(6) = 14.96, p = .021, high levels of ASPD, anger rumination, and aggression and low levels of TEI predict street gang membership. Compared with non-gang prisoners, street gang prisoners did not differ on callous-unemotional traits, age, or ethnicity. Results suggest that, compared with non-gang prisoners, street gang members were more likely to possess dysfunctional emotional dispositions. Findings from this research have important implications in terms of developing interventions for street gang membership. Specifically, this research supports the need for gang-specific early intervention and prevention programs, with emotion-focused components. Ideas for future research are discussed, including the identification of further sociocognitive, personality, and emotional traits distinguishing street gang from non-gang offenders.", "Executive deficits and impulsiveness are extensively reported in juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME). Previous literature suggests that intelligence may mediate these deficits. In this study, we evaluated and compared the performance of adults with JME with high and low intelligence quotient (IQ) and controls on tasks for executive function (EF) and impulsive traits. We investigated the neuropsychological performance of 53 adults with JME and below average IQ (57% women; 26.9 [\u00b17.88] years; mean IQ: 89.8 [\u00b15.1]), 26 adults with JME and average or above average IQ (53.8% women; 28.2 [\u00b19.33] years; mean IQ: 110.7 [\u00b18.3]), 38 controls with below average IQ (55% women; 28.4 [\u00b18.4] years; mean IQ: 90.1 [\u00b15.8]), and 31 controls with average or above average IQ (61.3% women; 32.20 [\u00b111.3] years; mean IQ: 111.6 [\u00b110.5]) with a comprehensive battery of neuropsychological tests that measure executive/attentional function. Impulsive traits were assessed using the Cloninger et al.'s Temperament and Character Inventory (novelty seeking (NS) domain). The group with JME with higher IQ presented worse performance compared with controls with higher IQ on Controlled Oral Word Association (COWA) and Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) (errors). This group showed worse performance than controls with lower IQ on Stroop Color-Word Test (SCT) 1, Trail Making (TM) A, COWA, and WCST (errors). Patients with lower IQ showed worse performance than controls with higher IQ on Digit Span Forward (DSF), Digit Span Backward (DSB), SCT1, SCT2, SCT3, TM A, COWA, and WCST (errors and failure to maintain set). Patients with lower IQ showed worse performance than controls with lower IQ on DSF, DSB, SCT1, SCT2, SCT3, TM A, TM B, COWA, and WCST (errors and failure to maintain set). Patients from groups with low and high IQ showed higher scores than controls with higher and lower IQ on impulsivity for NS1 and NS2 (except for patients with higher IQ versus controls with lower IQ). Adults with JME and higher IQ show less evidence of EF deficits compared with those with JME and below average IQ, suggesting that a higher degree of intellectual efficiency may act as a compensatory mechanism. However, it does not minimize some aspects of impulsive traits. Patients with JME and higher cognitive reserve may create strategies to dodge their cognitive obstacles. In this context, intelligence may protect and, at the same time, \"mask\" impairments that could be detected earlier.", "Reinforcement learning involves decision-making in dynamic and uncertain environments and constitutes a crucial element of artificial intelligence. In our previous work, we experimentally demonstrated that the ultrafast chaotic oscillatory dynamics of lasers can be used to efficiently solve the two-armed bandit problem, which requires decision-making concerning a class of difficult trade-offs called the exploration-exploitation dilemma. However, only two selections were employed in that research; hence, the scalability of the laser-chaos-based reinforcement learning should be clarified. In this study, we demonstrated a scalable, pipelined principle of resolving the multi-armed bandit problem by introducing time-division multiplexing of chaotically oscillated ultrafast time series. The experimental demonstrations in which bandit problems with up to 64 arms were successfully solved are presented where laser chaos time series significantly outperforms quasiperiodic signals, computer-generated pseudorandom numbers, and coloured noise. Detailed analyses are also provided that include performance comparisons among laser chaos signals generated in different physical conditions, which coincide with the diffusivity inherent in the time series. This study paves the way for ultrafast reinforcement learning by taking advantage of the ultrahigh bandwidths of light wave and practical enabling technologies.", "Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) represent a complex group of neurodevelopmental conditions characterized by deficits in communication and social behaviors. We examined the functional connectivity (FC) of the default mode network (DMN) and its relation to multimodal morphometry to investigate superregional, system-level alterations in a group of 22 adolescents and young adults with high-functioning autism compared to age-, and intelligence quotient-matched 29 healthy controls. The main findings were that ASD patients had gray matter (GM) reduction, decreased cortical thickness and larger cortical surface areas in several brain regions, including the cingulate, temporal lobes, and amygdala, as well as increased gyrification in regions associated with encoding visual memories and areas of the sensorimotor component of the DMN, more pronounced in the left hemisphere. Moreover, patients with ASD had decreased connectivity between the posterior cingulate cortex, and areas of the executive control component of the DMN and increased FC between the anteromedial prefrontal cortex and areas of the sensorimotor component of the DMN. Reduced cortical thickness in the right inferior frontal lobe correlated with higher social impairment according to the scores of the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R). Reduced cortical thickness in left frontal regions, as well as an increased cortical thickness in the right temporal pole and posterior cingulate, were associated with worse scores on the communication domain of the ADI-R. We found no association between scores on the restrictive and repetitive behaviors domain of ADI-R with structural measures or FC. The combination of these structural and connectivity abnormalities may help to explain some of the core behaviors in high-functioning ASD and need to be investigated further.", "The purpose of this investigation was to examine a single-anagram, a double-anagram, and multi-anagram versions of the Anagram Persistence Task (APT) for factorial validity, reliability, and convergent validity. Additionally, a battery of intelligence tests was administered to examine convergent validity. Based on an unrestricted factor analysis, two factors were uncovered from the 14 anagram (seven very difficult and seven very easy) response times: test-taking persistence and verbal processing speed. The internal consistency reliabilities for the single-anagram, double-anagram, and multi-anagram (seven difficult anagrams) measures were .42, .85, and .86, respectively. Furthermore, all three versions of the APT correlated positively with intelligence test performance (r \u2248 .22). However, the double-anagram and multi-anagram versions also evidenced negative, nonlinear effects with intelligence test performance (r \u2248 -.15), which suggested the possibility of testee adaptation. Taking psychometrics and administration time into consideration, simultaneously, the double-anagram version of the APT may be regarded as preferred.", "The artificial intelligence and image processing technology can develop automatic diagnostic algorithm for pediatric otitis media (OM) with accuracy comparable to that from well-trained otologists.\nOM is a public health issue that occurs commonly in pediatric population. Caring for OM may incur significant indirect cost that stems mainly from loss of school or working days seeking for medical consultation. It makes great sense for the homecare of OM. In this study, we aim to develop an automatic diagnostic algorithm for pediatric OM.\nA total of 1,230 otoscopic images were collected. Among them, 214 images diagnosed of acute otitis media (AOM) and otitis media with effusion (OME) are used as the database for image classification in this study. For the OM image classification system, the image database is randomly partitioned into the test and train subsets. Of each image in the train and test sets, the desired eardrum image region is first segmented, then multiple image features such as color, and shape are extracted. The multitask joint sparse representation-based classification to combine different features of the OM image is used for classification.\nThe multitask joint sparse representation algorithm was applied for the classification of the AOM and OME images. The approach is able to differentiate the OME from AOM images and achieves the classification accuracy as high as 91.41%.\nOur results demonstrated that this automatic diagnosis algorithm has acceptable accuracy to diagnose pediatric OM. The cost-effective algorithm can assist parents for early detection and continuous monitoring at home to decrease consequence of the disease.", "Robot swarms mimic natural systems in which collective abilities emerge from the interaction of individuals. So far, the swarm robotics literature has focused on the emergence of mechanical abilities (e.g., push a heavy object) and simple cognitive abilities (e.g., select a path between two alternatives). In this article, we present a robot swarm in which a complex cognitive ability emerged. This swarm was able to collectively sequence tasks whose order of execution was a priori unknown. Because sequencing tasks is an albeit simple form of planning, the robot swarm that we present provides a different perspective on a pivotal debate in the history of artificial intelligence: the debate on planning in robotics. In the proposed swarm, the two robotics paradigms-deliberative (sense-model-plan-act) and reactive (sense-act)-that are traditionally considered antithetical coexist in a particular way: The ability to plan emerges at the collective level from the interaction of reactive individuals.", "Interest in artificial intelligence (AI) research has grown rapidly over the past few years, in part thanks to the numerous successes of modern machine learning techniques such as deep learning, the availability of large datasets and improvements in computing power. AI is proving to be increasingly applicable to healthcare and there is a growing list of tasks where algorithms have matched or surpassed physician performance. Despite the successes there remain significant concerns and challenges surrounding algorithm opacity, trust and patient data security. Notwithstanding these challenges, AI technologies will likely become increasingly integrated into emergency medicine in the coming years. This perspective presents an overview of current AI research relevant to emergency medicine.", "Pain and emotional well-being are complexly associated both globally and in the moment. Emotional regulation strategies may contribute to that complexity by shaping the pain-well-being association.\nUsing emotional intelligence (EI) as an integrative conceptual framework, this study probed the role of emotional regulation in the associations of osteoarthritis pain with emotional well-being in varying time frames. Perceived attention to, clarity, and regulation of emotions were examined as predictors of well-being, and as moderators of the well-being-pain association, at global and momentary (within-day) levels.\nIn a microlongitudinal study, 218 older adults with physician-diagnosed knee osteoarthritis self-reported global pain, depressive symptoms, and EI (mood attention, clarity, and repair). Momentary pain and positive and negative affect were then assessed four times daily for 7 days. EI subscales were examined as moderators of the pain-well-being association at global and momentary levels, controlling demographics and general health.\nGlobal and momentary pain were positively associated with mood clarity and negatively with attention, but not with repair. Clarity and repair negatively predicted depression, and buffered effects of pain on depression. Momentary negative affect was negatively predicted by mood clarity and repair; again, clarity and mood repair buffered effects of momentary pain on negative affect. Only mood repair predicted positive affect, with no interactions emerging.\nAttention to mood states exacerbates the experience of pain in both short and long terms. In contrast, both mood clarity and ability to repair moods appear important to both momentary and longer-term emotional well-being.", "The digitalization in medicine has led to almost universal availability of information to different healthcare professionals and accelerated clinical pathways. Fast-track concepts and short hospital stays require intelligent and practicable systems in preventive and rehabilitation medicine. This includes optimization of movement analysis by innovative tools such as detectors sensing skin movements, portable feedback systems for monitoring, robot-assisted devices, and prevention programs based on reliable data. Finally, clinical structures are needed to exploit the maximal potential of artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning. One example is the establishment of inter- and transdisciplinary professional teams such as a\u00a0RehaBoard. In contrast to other cost-intensive disciplines such as oncology, the introduction of AI into rehabilitation orthopedics and trauma surgery with the support of cross-sectoral cooperation has great potential for performing well in patient benefit-orientated competition (value-based competition).", "Medical practice generates and stores immense amounts of clinical process data, while integrating and utilization of these data requires interdisciplinary cooperation together with novel models and methods to further promote applications of medical big data and research of artificial intelligence. A \"Datathon\" model is a novel event of data analysis and is typically organized as intense, short-duration, competitions in which participants with various knowledge and skills cooperate to address clinical questions based on \"real world\" data. This article introduces the origin of Datathon, organization of the events and relevant practice. The Datathon approach provides innovative solutions to promote cross-disciplinary collaboration and new methods for conducting research of big data in healthcare. It also offers insight into teaming up multi-expertise experts to investigate relevant clinical questions and further accelerate the application of medical big data.", "Cancer research is among the most active biomedical research domains for the European Union (EU). However, little quantitative empirical evidence is available to guide the decisions on the choice of disease site to study, specific research domain focus or allocation of research resources. To inform national/supranational cancer research policy, high-resolution intelligence is needed.\nWe performed a bibliometric analysis of European cancer research papers in the Web of Science from 2002 to 2013 to quantify research activity in each of the 28 EU Member States, along with Iceland, Norway and Switzerland (EUR31), which cancer sites/research domains they addressed, and their sources of financial support (2009-2013).\nCancer research papers from EUR31 correlated well with national Gross Domestic Products (r2\u00a0=\u00a00.94). However, certain cancer sites (lung, oesophagus and pancreas)\u00a0were under-researched relative to their disease burden, whereas central nervous system and blood cancers were more generously supported than their burden would warrant. An analysis of research domains indicated a paucity of research on radiotherapy (5%), palliative care (1.2%) and quality of life (0.5%). European cancer research funding in 2012-2013 amounted to \u223c\u20ac7.6 billion and came from diverse sources, especially in western Europe/Scandinavia, where in nine countries the charitable sector outspent the government\u00a0but not in Eastern Europe where charitable research funding barely exists.\nSeveral countries need to increase their cancer research outputs substantially, and/or alter their research portfolios to better match their growing (and changing) cancer burden. More co-ordination among funding agencies is required, so that resources can be attuned to align activities to research gaps and perceived clinical needs. In Eastern Europe, the charitable funding sector needs to be developed, so that both public and patient advocacy can have an active role in research.", "The development of neuropsychological assessment methods using virtual reality (VR) is a valid and promising option for the detection of cognitive impairment in the older people, focusing on activities composed of tasks of multiple demands. This study verified the association of age, schooling, and general cognitive status on the performance of neurologically healthy older adults in ECO-VR, a VR task of multiple demands for neuropsychological assessment. A total of 111 older adults answered a sociodemographic questionnaire, the Mini Mental State Examination, the Vocabulary subtest of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Adults (third edition), and the ECO-VR. Correlation analyses, multiple linear regression, and comparisons between groups (effects by age and schooling groups) were used to evaluate the results. The ECO-VR total score was significantly associated with age, years of education, MMSE, and Vocabulary subtest. The linear regression models identified that age was the main predictor for total score and rule breaking of ECO-VR. According to the univariate analysis, it was identified the main effect of age group and schooling group in the total ECO-VR score, but there was no interaction effect. The results are discussed in order to understand the role of sociodemographic characteristics in the performance of older adults in a VR task of multiple demands. It was also verified the possibility use of VR for neuropsychological assessment of older adults.", "Teledermatology is the use of telecommunication technologies to exchange medical information for diagnosis, consultation, treatment and teaching in dermatology. While its use has been evaluated in a wide range of dermatological diagnoses, only few studies exist on its validity, diagnostic precision, feasibility, and cost-effectiveness in occupational dermatology. However, these studies show a considerable potential for diagnosis, prevention, treatment support and follow-up of patients with occupational skin diseases. Asynchronous (store and forward; SAF) or synchronous dermatology teleconsults could assist occupational medicine specialists not only in occupational preventive care, but also in the context of skin cancer screening in outdoor workers. Thus, teledermatology might contribute to earlier prevention and notification of occupational skin diseases. Modern smartphone apps with artificial intelligence technologies may also facilitate self-monitoring in employees working in high-risk jobs.", "The article examines the cross-cultural transferability of a widely accepted cross-cultural assessment tool - the Cultural Intelligence Scale (CQS) - using research conducted in Slovenia and insights from the American and Slovenian researchers who translated the tool into Slovene and adapted it for use in Slovenia. In the context of a qualitative focus group based study, the researchers look at the specific characteristics of CQS perceptions within the Slovenian sample (two focus groups - one in the capital and the other in the south of the country) and identify barriers to these perceptions and the specific characteristics of the perceptions of Slovenian citizens regarding cross-cultural interaction.", "Biological intelligence processes information using impulses or spikes, which makes those living creatures able to perceive and act in the real world exceptionally well and outperform state-of-the-art robots in almost every aspect of life. To make up the deficit, emerging hardware technologies and software knowledge in the fields of neuroscience, electronics, and computer science have made it possible to design biologically realistic robots controlled by spiking neural networks (SNNs), inspired by the mechanism of brains. However, a comprehensive review on controlling robots based on SNNs is still missing. In this paper, we survey the developments of the past decade in the field of spiking neural networks for control tasks, with particular focus on the fast emerging robotics-related applications. We first highlight the primary impetuses of SNN-based robotics tasks in terms of speed, energy efficiency, and computation capabilities. We then classify those SNN-based robotic applications according to different learning rules and explicate those learning rules with their corresponding robotic applications. We also briefly present some existing platforms that offer an interaction between SNNs and robotics simulations for exploration and exploitation. Finally, we conclude our survey with a forecast of future challenges and some associated potential research topics in terms of controlling robots based on SNNs.", "22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS) is a genetic condition associated with a highly variable phenotypic expression. During childhood speech and language deficits are commonly observed. Findings of cross-sectional studies suggest syndrome-specific and changing language profiles, but a longitudinal approach to identify developmental changes is still lacking to date.\nThe present study aimed to delineate language characteristics and trajectories by comparing the performance of Dutch-speaking school-aged children with 22q11.2DS (n\u202f=\u202f18) to those of peers with idiopathic intellectual disability (IID, n \u202f=\u202f19) and to those of children with IID and comorbid autism spectrum disorder (IID\u202f+\u202fASD, n\u202f=\u202f23). The literature shows contradictory findings regarding language comprehension difficulties in children with 22q11.2DS, we focused on the receptive-expressive language discrepancy. Given their relative strength for verbal short-term memory (VSTM) tasks, a fine-grained error categorization was included to elucidate a possible influence of VSTM on the expressive language outcomes. Finally, we suggested that the inability of children with 22q11.2DS to use contextual information could interfere with morphosyntactic measures.\nAll groups (22q11.2DS, IID, and IID\u202f+\u202fASD) were matched for nonverbal fluid reasoning (Gf) using the Analogies and Categories subtests of the Snijders-Oomen Nonverbal Intelligence Test or the Matrix Reasoning and Picture Concepts subtests of the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence. Several structural language skills were measured using the Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals and Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test. The same instruments were re-administered after 18 to 24 months. A fine-grained error analysis of the Formulating and Recalling Sentences subtests, both measuring expressive syntax, explored factors contributing to expressive language deficits.\nIn children with 22q11.2DS the relative advantage of receptive over expressive language had decreased compared to children with IID. For children with 22q11.2DS, complex sentence comprehension remained very challenging over time. Expressive language skills seemed less limited compared to children with IID, and were accompanied by less VSTM difficulties. In children with 22q11.2DS and children with IID\u202f+\u202fASD, variable patterns of strengths and weaknesses were demonstrated, resulting in subtle differences between these groups. Error analyses indicated disregard of content-contextual cues and use of vague and elliptic language as being typical for children with 22q11.2DS.\nWe recommend that in children with 22q11.2DS the impact of the receptive language impairment should be comprehensively examined and followed-up since it can have a negative effect on their social communication skills, adaptive functioning and academic achievement. Error analysis underscores that multiple measures should be used to evaluate the child's expressive language ability. Further research should focus on developmental trajectories of social communication skills and on the use of intervention strategies to improve language comprehension and pragmatics in school-aged children with 22q11.2DS.", "In a recent article in Pediatric Nephrology, Olivier Niel and colleagues applied an artificial intelligence algorithm to a clinical problem that continues to challenge experienced pediatric nephrologists: optimizing the target weight of children on dialysis. They compared blood pressure, antihypertensive medication and intradialytic symptoms in children whose target weight was prescribed firstly by a nephrologist, then subsequently using a machine learning algorithm. Improvements in all outcome measures are reported. Their innovative approach to tackling this important clinical problem appears promising. In this editorial, we discuss the strengths and weaknesses of their study and consider to what extent machine learning strategies are suited to optimizing pediatric dialysis outcomes.", "Retrospective neuroimaging studies have suggested an association between early cannabis onset and later neurocognitive impairment. However, these studies have been limited in their ability to distinguish substance use risk factors from cannabis-induced effects on neurocognition. We used a prospective cohort design to test whether neurocognitive differences preceded cannabis onset (substance use risk model) and if early cannabis use was associated with poorer neurocognitive development (cannabis exposure model).\nParticipants (N\u00a0= 85) completed a visuospatial working memory task during functional magnetic resonance imaging and multiple cognitive assessments (Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-IV, Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery) at 12 years of age, before any reported cannabis use (baseline), and at 15 years of age (follow-up: N\u00a0= 85 cognitive assessments, n\u00a0= 67 neuroimaging). By follow-up, 22 participants reported using cannabis and/or failed a \u03949-tetrahydrocannabinol urine screen (users).\nAt baseline, group differences supported a risk model. Those who would initiate cannabis use by 15 years of age had activation differences in frontoparietal (increased) and visual association (decreased) regions and poorer executive planning scores (Stockings of Cambridge) compared with noninitiators. Limited support was found for a cannabis exposure model. At follow-up, activation in the cuneus displayed a significant cannabis dose-response relationship, although neither cannabis dose nor cuneus activation was associated with cognitive performance.\nThe purported neurocognitive effects of early cannabis onset may not be due to cannabis initiation alone but also driven by limitations or late development of neurocognitive systems predictive of substance use. In addition, more prolonged cannabis exposure may be required to observe the cognitive effects of early cannabis onset.", "This paper presents a cloud-based building energy management system, underpinned by semantic middleware, that integrates an enhanced sensor network with advanced analytics, accessible through an intuitive Web-based user interface. The proposed solution is described in terms of its three key layers: 1) user interface; 2) intelligence; and 3) interoperability. The system's intelligence is derived from simulation-based optimized rules, historical sensor data mining, and a fuzzy reasoner. The solution enables interoperability through a semantic knowledge base, which also contributes intelligence through reasoning and inference abilities, and which are enhanced through intelligent rules. Finally, building energy performance monitoring is delivered alongside optimized rule suggestions and a negotiation process in a 3-D Web-based interface using WebGL. The solution has been validated in a real pilot building to illustrate the strength of the approach, where it has shown over 25% energy savings. The relevance of this paper in the field is discussed, and it is argued that the proposed solution is mature enough for testing across further buildings.", "Intellectual disabilities (IDs) have become a public health concern worldwide, but few studies on rehabilitation service utilisation in this population were conducted in developing countries. We aimed to examine trends and socioeconomic disparities in the utilisation of rehabilitation services among adults with IDs in China.\nWe obtained data from a population-based survey by using a multistage, randomised, cluster sampling process to ascertain adults with IDs in 2006 and a selected subsample for follow-up surveys during 2007-2013. Psychiatrists ascertained individuals with IDs ascertained by intelligence quotient score under 70, deficits in two or more adaptive behaviours and age of onset under 18\u00a0years.\nOverall, the utilisation rate of rehabilitation services significantly increased from 10.1% in 2007 to 33.7% in 2013, with an annual average percentage growth of 34.3% when adjusting for multiple confounders. The mounting trends remained significant in all socioeconomic groups. The growth rates among lower socioeconomic participants were much higher than those among higher socioeconomic participants, and the strength in the association between socioeconomic position (education and region) and rehabilitation service utilisation declined in 2007-2013.\nThis study found an upward trend in rehabilitation service utilisation in Chinese adults with IDs during 2007-2013, and socioeconomic disparities in rehabilitation service use in this population showed a downward trend over time.", "Emotional Intelligence has made a significant contribution to effective leadership, becoming one of the key characteristics of leaders.Objective: The aim of the present study was to review qualitative and quantitative studies concerning Emotional Intelligence of nurse leaders and the evidence-based composition of their results.\nA search was performed in the electronic databases (Pubmed, Scopus and CINAHL) for articles, which were published in the period 2000-2017 in English or Greek. Eleven studies met the inclusion criteria, of which 10 were quantitative and one was qualitative.\nThe results suggested that Emotional Intelligence is a useful tool for nurse leaders and contributes decisively to the achievement of effective management in healthcare.\nIt is necessary for nurses to improve their social and emotional skills because of the particular nature of the nursing profession, which places the healthy or weak person at its center.", "The applicability of the statistical tools coupled with artificial intelligence techniques was tested to optimize the critical medium components for the production of extracellular cholesterol oxidase (COD; an enzyme of commercial interest) from Streptomyces rimosus MTCC 10792. The initial medium component screening was performed using Placket-Burman design with yeast extract, dextrose, starch and ammonium carbonate as significant factors. Response surface methodology (RSM) was attempted to develop a statistical model with a significant coefficient of determination (R2\u2009=\u20090.89847), followed by model optimization using Genetic Algorithm (GA). RSM-GA based optimization approach predicted that the combination of yeast extract, dextrose, starch and ammonium carbonate at concentrations 0.99, 0.8, 0.1, and 0.05\u2009g/100\u2009ml respectively, has resulted in 3.6 folds increase in COD production (5.41 U/ml) in comparison with the un-optimized medium (1.5 U/ml). COD was purified 10.34 folds having specific activity of 12.37 U/mg with molecular mass of 54\u2009kDa. The enzyme was stable at pH 7.0 and 40\u2009\u00b0C temperature. The apparent Michaelis constant (Km) and Vmax values of COD were 0.043\u2009mM and 2.21 \u03bcmol/min/mg, respectively. This is the first communication reporting RSM-GA based medium optimization, purification and characterization of COD by S. rimosus isolated from the forest soil of eastern India.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) is already widely employed in various medical roles, and ongoing technological advances are encouraging more widespread use of AI in imaging. This is partly driven by the recognition of the significant frequency and clinical impact of human errors in radiology reporting, and the promise that AI can help improve the reliability as well the efficiency of imaging interpretation. AI in imaging was first envisioned in the 1960s, but initial attempts were limited by the technology of the day. It was the introduction of artificial neural networks and AI based computer aided detection (CAD) software in the 1980s that marked the advent of widespread integration of AI within radiology reporting. CAD is now routinely used in mammography, with consistent evidence of equivalent or improved lesion detection, with small increases in recall rates. Significant false positive rates remain a limitation for CAD, although these have markedly improved in the last decade. Other challenges include the difficulty clinicians encounter in trying to understand the reasoning of an AI system, which may limit their confidence in its advice, and a question mark hangs over who should be liable if CAD makes an error. The future integration of CAD with PACS promises the development of more comprehensively intelligent systems that can identify multiple, challenging diagnoses, and a move towards more individualised patient outcome predictions based upon AI analysis.", "Recent work has begun to relate individual differences in brain functional organization to human behaviors and cognition, but the best brain state to reveal such relationships remains an open question. In two large, independent data sets, we here show that cognitive tasks amplify trait-relevant individual differences in patterns of functional connectivity, such that predictive models built from task fMRI data outperform models built from resting-state fMRI data. Further, certain tasks consistently yield better predictions of fluid intelligence than others, and the task that generates the best-performing models varies by sex. By\u00a0considering task-induced brain state and sex, the best-performing model explains over 20% of the variance in fluid intelligence scores, as compared to <6% of variance explained by rest-based models. This suggests that identifying and inducing the right brain state in a given group can better reveal brain-behavior relationships, motivating a paradigm shift from rest- to task-based functional connectivity analyses.", "This study reflects my personal experience with the characterization of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) epitopes and their significance in HLA matching for transplantation. It offers a subjective assessment what further studies are needed to have this concept be applied in the clinical setting.\nThis study addresses the structural characteristics of antibody-reactive HLA epitopes determined by different methods, eplet-associated antibody analysis and acceptable mismatching for sensitized patients and eplet immunogenicity and determination of mismatch permissibility. BASIC IMPLICATIONS: for clinical practice and research consider the need for further studies of the structural basis of antibody-verified HLA epitopes determined in different techniques and their clinical relevance, the biological basis of epitope immunogenicity and determinations of permissible mismatches and a computerized clinical transplant database with an Artificial Intelligence component that can generate evidence-based information for the practical application of epitope-based HLA matching.", "Recent advances in deep learning have produced encouraging results for biomedical image segmentation; however, outcomes rely heavily on comprehensive annotation. In this paper, we propose a neural network architecture and a new algorithm, known as overlapped region forecast, for the automatic segmentation of gastric cancer images. To the best of our knowledge, this report for the first time describes that deep learning has been applied to the segmentation of gastric cancer images. Moreover, a reiterative learning framework that achieves superior performance without pretraining or further manual annotation is presented to train a simple network on weakly annotated biomedical images. We customize the loss function to make the model converge faster while avoiding becoming trapped in local minima. Patch boundary errors were eliminated by our overlapped region forecast algorithm. By studying the characteristics of the model trained using two different patch extraction methods, we train iteratively and integrate predictions and weak annotations to improve the quality of the training data. Using these methods, a mean Intersection over Union coefficient of 0.883 and a mean accuracy of 91.09% were achieved on the partially labeled dataset, thereby securing a win in the 2017 China Big Data and Artificial Intelligence Innovation and Entrepreneurship Competition.", "The relationship between the general factor of intelligence (g) and handedness is investigated using a combined sample of 23511 respondents from three large databases: the NLSY'79 (US), NLSY'97 (US) and NCDS (UK). Dextrals - those who use their right hands were found to be 1.22 IQ points higher than sinistrals (left handers) after controlling for sex and age and correcting for sources of measurement error. To see if the association between IQ and handedness was strongest on the abilities that were the best measures of g, the method of correlated vectors was used to test for moderation. Across the three studies, g was found to very weakly negatively moderate the association between ability measure and handedness (\u03c1\u202f=\u202f-.023, K\u202f=\u202f3, N\u202f=\u202f23511), however in the NLSY'79, the coding speed subtest was an outlier in terms of the strength of its association with handedness. Its removal yielded indications of positive moderation in this dataset, which when aggregated boosted the overall vector correlation value to .539 (K\u202f=\u202f3, N\u202f=\u202f23511), suggesting that g might be an important moderator of this relationship. Secondary analysis of secular trend data on the changing percentage of sinistrals in Western populations indicates that overall, sinistrality has increased, entailing a g decline of .106 points over 150\u202fyears (.006 points per decade). The secular increase in sinistrality is consistent with other data indicating long-term declines in developmental stability and may stem from some combination of increasing mutation load and environmental stress in Western populations.", "It is not clear whether the fornix and cingulum are involved in cognition after putaminal hemorrhage (PH). We investigated structural changes and differences of the neural tracts, and the relationship between the integrity of the neural tracts and cognition not only at the affected but also at the unaffected side.Sixteen patients with left chronic putaminal hemorrhage and 20 healthy volunteers were enrolled. Using diffusion tensor tractography (DTT), we compared fiber number (FN), fractional anisotropy (FA), and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of the neural tracts between patient and control groups. The relationship between the neural tract parameters and neuropsychological results was also analyzed.The left fornix FN was significantly lower than the right fornix FN in the patient group. Except for the cingulum FA, the neural tracts parameters for both the affected and unaffected hemispheres differed significantly between the groups. The fornix FA and ADC at the affected side were significantly correlated with intelligence quotient (IQ), mini-mental status examination (MMSE), and short-term memory. Interestingly, the fornix ADC at the unaffected side was significantly correlated with MMSE. However, none of the cingulum parameters was correlated with neuropsychological results.The fornix integrity is critical for cognitive impairment after putaminal hemorrhage.", "In contrast to population-based medical decision making, which emphasizes the use of evidence-based treatment strategies for groups of patients, personalized medicine is based on optimizing treatment at the level of the individual patient. The creation of molecular profiles of individual patients was made possible by the advent of \"omics\" technologies, based on high throughput instrumental techniques in combination with biostatistics tools and artificial intelligence. The goal of personalized laboratory medicine is to use advanced technologies in the process of preventive, curative or palliative patient management. Personalized medicine does not rely on changes in concentration of a single molecular marker to make a therapeutic decision, but rather on changes of a profile of markers characterizing an individual patient's status, taking into account not only the expected response to treatment of the disease but also the expected response of the patient. Such medical approach promises a more effective diagnostics with more effective and safer treatment, as well as faster recovery and restoration of health and improved cost effectiveness. The laboratory medicine profession is aware of its key role in personalized medicine, but to empower the laboratories, at least an enhancement in cooperation between disciplines within laboratory medicine will be necessary.", "Experts in medical informatics have argued for the incorporation of ever more machine-learning algorithms into medical care. As artificial intelligence (AI) research advances, such technologies raise the possibility of an \"iDoctor,\" a machine theoretically capable of replacing the judgment of primary care physicians. In this article, I draw on Martin Heidegger's critique of technology to show how an algorithmic approach to medicine distorts the physician-patient relationship. Among other problems, AI cannot adapt guidelines according to the individual patient's needs. In response to the objection that AI could develop this capacity, I use Hubert Dreyfus's analysis of AI to argue that attention to the needs of each patient requires the physician to attune his or her perception to the patient's history and physical exam, an ability that seems uniquely human. Human physician judgment will remain better suited to the practice of primary care despite anticipated advances in AI technology.", "Dry weight is the lowest weight patients on hemodialysis can tolerate; correct dry weight estimation is necessary to minimize morbi-mortality, but is difficult to achieve. Here, we used artificial intelligence to improve the accuracy of dry weight assessment in hemodialysis patients.\nWe designed a neural network which used bio-impedancemetry, blood volume monitoring, and blood pressure values as inputs; output was artificial intelligence dry weight. Fourteen pediatric patients were switched from nephrologist to artificial intelligence dry weight. Artificial intelligence dry weight was higher (28.6%), lower (50%), or identical to nephrologist dry weight. Mean difference between artificial intelligence and nephrologist dry weights was 0.497\u00a0kg (-\u20091.33 to +\u20091.29\u00a0kg). In patients for whom artificial intelligence dry weight was lower than nephrologist dry weight, systolic blood pressure significantly decreased after dry weight decrease to artificial intelligence dry weight (77th to 60th percentile, p\u00a0=\u20090.022); anti-hypertensive treatments were successfully decreased or discontinued in 28.7% of cases. In patients for whom artificial intelligence dry weight was higher than nephrologist dry weight, no hypertension was observed after dry weight increase to artificial intelligence dry weight; when present, symptoms of dry weight underestimation receded.\nNeural network predictions outperformed those of experienced nephrologists in most cases, proving artificial intelligence is a powerful tool for predicting dry weight in hemodialysis patients.", "To realize human-like robot intelligence, a large-scale cognitive architecture is required for robots to understand their environment through a variety of sensors with which they are equipped. In this paper, we propose a novel framework named Serket that enables the construction of a large-scale generative model and its inferences easily by connecting sub-modules to allow the robots to acquire various capabilities through interaction with their environment and others. We consider that large-scale cognitive models can be constructed by connecting smaller fundamental models hierarchically while maintaining their programmatic independence. Moreover, the connected modules are dependent on each other and their parameters must be optimized as a whole. Conventionally, the equations for parameter estimation have to be derived and implemented depending on the models. However, it has become harder to derive and implement equations of large-scale models. Thus, in this paper, we propose a parameter estimation method that communicates the minimum parameters between various modules while maintaining their programmatic independence. Therefore, Serket makes it easy to construct large-scale models and estimate their parameters via the connection of modules. Experimental results demonstrated that the model can be constructed by connecting modules, the parameters can be optimized as a whole, and they are comparable with the original models that we have proposed.", "Cerebral metabolism may play a significant role in neurobehavioural disability following traumatic brain injury (TBI). In this study, we examined the relationship between intelligence quotient (IQ) and the cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2) in the lateral prefrontal cortex, which was measured by 15O-labelled gas positron emission tomography (PET), in patients with TBI.\nThe subjects were 12 patients (eight males and four females) who suffered from neurobehavioural disability following TBI. Their mean age was 33.3\u00a0years. The cause of injury was traffic accidents in all patients and the mean period after injury was 44.8\u00a0months. These patients underwent 15O-labelled gas PET and tests using either the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised (WAIS-R) or the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised (WISC-R). Pearson's correlation between CMRO2 and total IQ (TIQ) was calculated.\nA statistically significant correlation was observed between TIQ and CMRO2 in the right Brodmann areas (BAs) 44 and 45. The lower the WAIS score, the higher the CMRO2 in both areas.\nNeurological function negatively correlated with the metabolism of oxygen. It was possible that changes in brain networks increased the neuronal activity in the undamaged areas and that the increased activity compensated for the function decline.", "The success rate of pharmaceutical Research & Development (R&D) is much lower compared to other industries such as micro-electronics or aeronautics with the probability of a successful clinical development to approval in central nervous system (CNS) disorders hovering in the single digits (7%). Areas covered: Inspired by adjacent engineering-based industries, we argue that quantitative modeling in CNS R&D might improve success rates. We will focus on quantitative techniques in early clinical development, such as PharmacoKinetic-PharmacoDynamic modeling, clinical trial simulation, model-based meta-analysis and the mechanism-based physiology-based pharmacokinetic modeling, and quantitative systems pharmacology. Expert commentary: Mechanism-based computer modeling rely less on existing clinical datasets, therefore can better generalize than Big Data analytics, including prospectively and quantitatively predicting the clinical outcome of new drugs. More specifically, exhaustive post-hoc analysis of failed trials using individual virtual human trial simulation could illuminate underlying causes such as lack of sufficient functional target engagement, negative pharmacodynamic interactions with comedications and genotypes, and mismatched patient population. These insights are beyond the capacity of artificial intelligence (AI) methods as they are many more possible combinations than subjects. Unlike 'black box' approaches in AI, mechanism-based platforms are transparent and based on biologically sound assumptions that can be interrogated.", "The importance of leadership development in the early stages of careers in the NHS has been highlighted in recent years and many programmes have been implemented which seek to develop leadership skills in healthcare professionals. The Improving Global Health (IGH) Fellowship scheme is one such programme, it provides a unique leadership development opportunity through an overseas placement with a focus on quality improvement work. This evaluation examines the impact of completing an IGH Fellowship on the career and leadership development of participants, who are referred to as Fellows.\nFellows who had returned from overseas placement between August 2008 and February 2015 were invited to complete an anonymised online questionnaire, which collected information on: demographic details, motivations for applying to the programme, leadership development and the impact of the IGH Fellowship on their career. Fifteen semi-structured interviews were conducted to further explore the impact of the programme on Fellows' leadership development and career progression. Interview transcripts were manually coded and underwent thematic content analysis.\nThe questionnaire had a 67% (74/111) response rate. The number of fellows who self-identified as a leader more than doubled on completion of the IGH Fellowship (24/74 pre-fellowship versus 58/74 post-fellowship). 74% (55/74) reported that the IGH Fellowship had an impact upon their career, 35 of which reported that the impact was \"substantial\". The themes that emerged from the interviews revealed a personal development cycle that consolidated the fellows' interests and values whilst enhancing their self-efficacy and subsequently impacted positively upon their career choices. Three interviewees expressed frustration at the lack of opportunity to utilise their new skills on returning to the United Kingdom (UK).\nThe IGH Fellowship successfully empowered healthcare professionals to self-identify as leaders. Of the 45/74 respondents who commented on the impact of the IGH Fellowship on their career, 41/45 comments were positive. The fellows described a process of experiential learning, reflection and evolving cultural intelligence, which consolidated their interests and values. The resultant increase in self-efficacy empowered these returned fellows in their choice of career.", "Limited research has documented an association between soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infections and child development. This has recently been identified as an important knowledge gap.\nA longitudinal cohort study was conducted in Iquitos, Peru, between September 2011 and July 2016. A cohort of 880 children, recruited at 1\u2009year of age, was followed up to 5\u2009years. STH infection was measured annually and child development was measured with the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence III (WPPSI-III) at 5\u2009years. Linear-regression models were used to investigate the effect of the number of detected STH infections between 1 and 5\u2009years of age on WPPSI-III scores at 5\u2009years of age. Bayesian latent class analysis was used to adjust for exposure misclassification.\nA total of 781 (88.8%) children were included in the analysis. In multivariable analysis, adjusted for STH misclassification, increasing numbers of Ascaris, Trichuris, hookworm and any STH infections were associated with lower WPPSI-III scores. Among the largest observed effects were those for the effect of Ascaris infection on verbal IQ scores [difference in IQ (95% CrI) for two, three, and four or five detected infections compared with zero or one infection: -8.27 (-13.85, -3.10), -6.69 (-12.05, -2.05) and -5.06 (-10.75, 0.05), respectively]. Misclassification of STH infection generally led to a bias towards the null.\nThese results document an association between STH infection and child development. The results highlight the importance of adjusting for STH misclassification; however, future research is needed to accurately determine the sensitivity of STH diagnostic techniques. STH control in preschool children may contribute to lowering the disease burden associated with poor child development.", "The impairment to discriminate the motion direction of a large high contrast stimulus or to detect a stimulus surrounded by another one is called visual suppression and is the result of the normal function of our visual inhibitory mechanisms. Recently, Melnick et al. (2013), using a motion discrimination task, showed that intelligence strongly correlates with visual suppression (r = 0.71). Cook et al. (2016) also showed a strong link between contrast surround suppression and IQ (r = 0.87), this time using a contrast matching task. Our aim is to test this link using two different visual suppression tasks: a motion discrimination task and a contrast detection task. Fifty volunteers took part in the experiments. Using Bayesian staircases, we measured duration thresholds in the motion experiment and contrast thresholds in the spatial experiment. Although we found a much weaker effect, our results from the motion experiment still replicate previous results supporting the link between motion surround suppression and IQ (r = 0.43). However, our results from the spatial experiment do not support the link between contrast surround suppression and IQ (r = -0.09). Methodological differences between this study and previous studies which could explain these discrepancies are discussed.", "Emotional Intelligence (EI) has been conceptualized in the literature either as a dispositional tendency, in line with a personality trait (trait EI; Petrides and Furnham, 2001), or as an ability, moderately correlated with general intelligence (ability EI; Mayer and Salovey, 1997). Surprisingly, there have been few empirical attempts conceptualizing how the different EI approaches should be related to each other. However, understanding how the different approaches of EI may be interwoven and/or complementary is of primary importance for clarifying the conceptualization of EI and organizing the literature around it. We introduce a theoretical framework explaining how trait EI, ability EI, and emotion information processing - a novel component related to EI recently introduced in the literature (e.g., Fiori and Vesely Maillefer, 2018) - may contribute to effective emotion-related performance and provide initial evidence supporting its usefulness in predicting EI-related outcomes. More specifically, we show that performance in a task in which participants had to infer the mental and emotional states of others, namely a Theory of Mind task, was predicted jointly (e.g., interaction effects) by trait EI, ability EI, and emotion information processing, after controlling for personality and IQ (N = 323). Our results argue for the importance of investigating the joint contribution of different aspects of EI in explaining variability in emotionally laden outcomes.", "This study aimed to contribute to the understanding of the mechanisms underlying the relationship between aggressive behaviour and individual levels of ability emotional intelligence (EI). Three hundred and ninety-five participants took part in this study. Participants were assessed on ability EI, negative affect (NA), and aggression by the Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test, the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule, and the Buss-Perry Aggression questionnaires, respectively. The results revealed a negative relationship between aggression and ability EI, but this relationship depended on multiple factors: the type of EI branches and aggression dimensions, the influence of NA, and gender. Emotional management ability showed a direct relationship with aggression, while emotional perception ability presented an indirect relationship with aggression through the effect of NA. These EI abilities were related to different aggression dimensions, highlighting the direct relationship with physical aggression. Moreover, gender differences showed that women possess greater EI abilities, higher levels of NA, less aggressive behaviour, and a lower relationship between NA and aggression compared with men. This research offers a better understanding of the psychological processes explaining aggression. The inclusion of our findings in the design of prevention and treatment programs could be of great help in the control of aggressive behaviour.", "Recently, the concept of Internet of Agent has been introduced as a potential technology that pushes intelligence, data processing, analytics and communication capabilities down to the point where the data originates. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for a Decentralized Home Energy Management System by applying the Internet of Agent concept. In particular, we first present an Internet of Agent framework in terms of sensing, communicating and collaborating among connected appliances. Then, the decentralized management based on consensual negotiation mechanism with several intelligent techniques are proposed for dynamic scheduling connected appliance. Specifically, by applying the Internet of Agent framework, connected appliances are regarded as smart agents that are able to make individual decisions by reaching agreement over the exchange of operations on competitive resources. Furthermore, in this study, the load balancing problem in which load shifting is able to reduce the electricity demand during peak hours is taken into account in order to emphasize the effectiveness of our approach. For the experiment, we develop a simulation of smart home environment to evaluate our approach using NetLogo, a tool which provides real-time analysis in the modeling and simulation domain of complex systems.", "Reports an error in \"Complementary exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses of the French WISC-V: Analyses based on the standardization sample\" by Thierry Lecerf and Gary L. Canivez (Psychological Assessment, 2018[Jun], Vol 30[6], 793-808). In the original article a production error resulted in the deletion of subtests in the \"French WISC-V subtest\" column and the misalignment of factor names in the \"Eigenvalue\" column of Table 1. The corrected table is included in this erratum. The online version of this article has been corrected. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2017-57791-001.) Interpretation of the French Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Fifth Edition (French WISC-V; Wechsler, 2016a) is based on a 5-factor model including Verbal Comprehension (VC), Visual Spatial (VS), Fluid Reasoning (FR), Working Memory (WM), and Processing Speed (PS). Evidence for the French WISC-V factorial structure was established exclusively through confirmatory factor analyses (CFAs). However, as recommended by Carroll (1995); Reise (2012), and Brown (2015), factorial structure should derive from both exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and CFA. The first goal of this study was to examine the factorial structure of the French WISC-V using EFA. The 15 French WISC-V primary and secondary subtest scaled scores intercorrelation matrix was used and factor extraction criteria suggested from 1 to 4 factors. To disentangle the contribution of first- and second-order factors, the Schmid and Leiman (1957) orthogonalization transformation (SLT) was applied. Overall, no EFA evidence for 5 factors was found. Results indicated that the g factor accounted for about 67% of the common variance and that the contributions of the first-order factors were weak (3.6 to 11.9%). CFA was used to test numerous alternative models. Results indicated that bifactor models produced better fit to these data than higher-order models. Consistent with previous studies, findings suggested dominance of the general intelligence factor and that users should thus emphasize the Full Scale IQ (FSIQ) when interpreting the French WISC-V. (PsycINFO Database Record", "The sixteen papers in this special section focus on deep reinforcement learning and adaptive dynamic programming (deep RL/ADP). Deep RL is able to output control signal directly based on input images, which incorporates both the advantages of the perception of deep learning (DL) and the decision making of RL or adaptive dynamic programming (ADP). This mechanism makes the artificial intelligence much closer to human thinking modes. Deep RL/ADP has achieved remarkable success in terms of theory and applications since it was proposed. Successful applications cover video games, Go, robotics, smart driving, healthcare, and so on. However, it is still an open problem to perform the theoretical analysis on deep RL/ADP, e.g., the convergence, stability, and optimality analyses. The learning efficiency needs to be improved by proposing new algorithms or combined with other methods. More practical demonstrations are encouraged to be presented. Therefore, the aim of this special issue is to call for the most advanced research and state-of-the-art works in the field of deep RL/ADP.", "Considerable work in recent years has examined the relationship between cortical thickness (CT) and general intelligence (IQ) in healthy individuals. It is not known whether specific IQ variables (i.e., perceptual reasoning [PIQ], verbal comprehension IQ [VIQ], and full-scale IQ [FSIQ]) are associated with multiple cortical measures (i.e., CT, cortical volume (CV), cortical surface area (CSA) and cortical gyrification (CG)) within the same individuals. Here we examined the association between these neuroimaging metrics and IQ in 56 healthy adults. At a cluster-forming threshold (CFT) of p\u202f<\u202f0.05, we observed significant positive relationships between CT and all three IQ variables in regions within the posterior frontal and superior parietal lobes. Regions within the temporal and posterior frontal lobes exhibited positive relationships between CV and two IQ variables (PIQ and FSIQ) and regions within the inferior parietal lobe exhibited positive relationships between CV and PIQ. Additionally, CV was positively associated with VIQ in the left insula and with FSIQ within the inferior frontal gyrus. At a more stringent CFT (p\u202f<\u202f0.01), the CT-PIQ, CT-VIQ, CT-FSIQ, and CV-PIQ relationships remained significant within the posterior frontal lobe, as did the CV-PIQ relationship within the temporal and inferior parietal lobes. We did not observe statistically significant relationships between IQ and either CSA or CG. Our findings suggest that the neural basis of IQ extends beyond previously observed relationships with fronto-parietal regions. We also conclude that CT and CV may be more useful metrics than CSA or CG in the study of intellectual abilities.", "We introduce the task of Visual Dialog, which requires an AI agent to hold a meaningful dialog with humans in natural, conversational language about visual content. Specifically, given an image, a dialog history, and a question about the image, the agent has to ground the question in image, infer context from history, and answer the question accurately. Visual Dialog is disentangled enough from a specific downstream task so as to serve as a general test of machine intelligence, while being sufficiently grounded in vision to allow objective evaluation of individual responses and benchmark progress. We develop a novel two-person real-time chat data-collection protocol to curate a large-scale Visual Dialog dataset (VisDial). VisDial v0.9 has been released and consists of dialog question-answer pairs from 10-round, human-human dialogs grounded in images from the COCO dataset.", "Modern retinal imaging creates gigantic amounts of data (big data) of anatomic information.

Bayesian statistics were used to determine if there were differences between the monolingual and bilingual groups. Additional analyses involving covariates of maternal level of education and nonverbal intelligence, and matching on these same variables, were also completed.\nScaled-information Bayes factor scores more strongly favored the null hypothesis that there were no differences between the bilingual and monolingual groups on any of the executive function tasks. For 2 of the tasks, we found an advantage in favor of the monolingual group.\nIf there is a bilingual advantage in school-aged children, it is not robust across circumstances. We discuss potential factors that might counteract an actual advantage, including task reliability and environmental influences.", "Orthographic facilitation describes the phenomenon in which a spoken word is produced more accurately when its corresponding written word is present during learning. We examined the orthographic facilitation effect in children with dyslexia because they have poor learning and recall of spoken words. We hypothesized that including orthography during spoken word learning would facilitate learning and recall.\nChildren with dyslexia and children with typical development (n = 46 per group), 7-9 years old, were matched for grade and nonverbal intelligence. Across 4 blocks of exposure in 1 session, children learned pairings between 4 spoken pseudowords and novel semantic referents in a modified paired-associate learning task. Two of the pairings were presented with orthography present, and 2 were presented with orthography absent. Recall of newly learned spoken words was assessed using a naming task.\nBoth groups showed orthographic facilitation during learning and naming. During learning, both groups paired pseudowords and referents more accurately when orthography was present. During naming, children with typical development showed a large orthographic facilitation effect that increased across blocks. For children with dyslexia, this effect was present initially but then plateaued.\nWe demonstrate for the first time that children with dyslexia benefit from orthographic facilitation during spoken word learning. These findings have direct implications for teaching spoken vocabulary to children with dyslexia.", "Objectives: Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) accounts for less than 5% of strokes but is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Amongst survivors, neurocognitive complaints are common, often despite normal imaging. We used magnetoencephalography (MEG) to investigate neurophysiological function during a visual working memory task in aSAH survivors with good recovery and normal structural imaging. Methods: Patients with aSAH treated with coiling and exhibiting good outcome measured by Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) and without related parenchymal structural lesions in post-treatment MRI, were recruited and compared to age- and sex-matched controls. All participants underwent intelligence and cognitive screening, structural MRI, and MEG testing in conjunction with a 1-back visual working memory task. Sensor-level global field power and virtual electrode source analysis of neuronal activity and connectivity in aSAH were assessed. Results: Thirteen patients and 13 matched controls were enrolled (age: 56 \u00b1 11 years, 19 female). The 1-back task was completed with similar accuracy despite a trend for a longer reaction time in aSAH patients (p = 0.054). During encoding and recognition phases, aSAH patients showed significantly increased neuronal activation and hyperconnectivity in periventricular areas, specifically the anterior and posterior cingulate gyri. Conclusions: Increased posterior and anterior cingulate gyri neuronal activity is demonstrated in aSAH patients during visual working memory tasks, in the absence of structural lesions. These areas work mainly as a hub to \"organize\" memory storage and retrieval. Increased activity in these areas might be compensatory due to injury and consequently loss of neuronal response in connected areas in the working memory networks.", "In the context of non-point source pollution management and algal blooms control, the reliable nutrient forecasting is of critical importance. Considering the highly stochastic, non-linear, and non-stationary natures involved in riverine total nitrogen (TN) load time series data, some traditional statistical and artificial intelligence models are inherently unable to give accurate nutrient forecasts due to their mechanism and structure characteristics. In this study, based on the wavelet analysis (WA) and support vector regression (SVR), a promising combined WA-SVR model was proposed for forecasting riverine TN loads. The data pro-processing tool WA was employed to decompose the time series data of riverine TN load for revealing its dominator. Subsequently, all wavelet components were used as inputs to SVR for WA-SVR model. The continuous riverine TN loads during 2004-2012 in the ChangLe River watershed of eastern China were estimated by using a calibrated Load Estimator model. Performance criteria, namely, determination coefficient (R2), Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency (NS), and mean square error (MSE) were applied to assess the performance of the developed models. The effects of different mother wavelets on the efficiency of the conjunction model were investigated. The results demonstrated that the mother wavelet played a crucial role for the successful implementation of the WA-SVR model. Among the 23 selected mother wavelet functions, dmey wavelet performed best in forecasting the daily and monthly TN loads. Furthermore, the performance of the optimal WA-SVR model was compared with that of single SVR model without wavelet decomposition. The comparison indicated that the hybrid model provided better accuracy than that of single SVR model. For daily riverine TN loads, the R2, NS, and MSE values of WA-SVR model during the test stage were 0.9699, 0.9658, and 0.4885\u2009\u00d7\u2009107\u00a0kg/day, respectively. For monthly riverine TN loads, the R2, NS, and MSE values of the model during the test stage were 0.9163, 0.9159, and 0.3237\u2009\u00d7\u20091010\u00a0kg/month, respectively. The overall results strongly suggested that the combined WA-SVR method can successfully forecast riverine TN loads in agricultural watersheds.", "The overall purpose of this study was to examine the mediating effects of parents' coping strategies on the relationship between parents' emotional intelligence and sideline verbal behaviors during their children's soccer games. Participants were 232 parents (120 mothers and 110 fathers) of youth soccer players age 9-13 years. Observations in situ were carried out at 30 soccer games during a soccer tournament. At the end of the game, parents were approached and asked to complete the Emotional Intelligence Scale and the Brief COPE scale. Structural-equation-modeling analyses revealed that adaptive and maladaptive coping mediated the relationship between regulation of emotion and parents' praise/encouragement, and negative and derogatory comments during the game. In addition, game result moderated the relationships between emotional intelligence, coping strategies, and parent behaviors. Emotional regulation and adaptive coping may promote desirable parent sideline behaviors and reduce undesirable behaviors.", "Most research on the prevalence, distribution, and psychiatric comorbidity of intellectual disability (ID) relies on clinical samples, limiting the generalizability and utility of ID assessment in a legal context. This study assessed ID prevalence in a population-representative sample of US adolescents and examined associations of ID with socio-demographic factors and mental disorders.\nData were drawn from the National Comorbidity Survey Adolescent Supplement (N = 6256). ID was defined as: (1) IQ \u2a7d 76, measured using the Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test; (2) an adaptive behavior score \u2a7d76, and (3) age of onset \u2a7d18 measured using a validated scale. The Composite International Diagnostic Interview assessed 15 lifetime mental disorders. The Sheehan disability scale assessed disorder severity. We used logistic regression models to estimate differences in lifetime disorders for adolescents with and without ID.\nID prevalence was 3.2%. Among adolescents with ID, 65.1% met lifetime criteria for a mental disorder. ID status was associated with specific phobia, agoraphobia, and bipolar disorder, but not behavior disorders after adjustment for socio-demographics. Adolescents with ID and mental disorders were significantly more likely to exhibit severe impairment than those without ID.\nThese findings highlight how sample selection and overlap between ID and psychopathology symptoms might bias understanding of the mental health consequences of ID. For example, associations between ID and behavior disorders widely reported in clinical samples were not observed in a population-representative sample after adjustment for socio-demographic confounders. Valid assessment and understanding of these constructs may prove influential in the legal system by influencing treatment referrals and capital punishment decisions.General Scientific SummaryCurrent definitions of intellectual disability (ID) are based on three criteria: formal designation of low intelligence through artificial problem-solving tasks, impairment in one's ability to function in his/her social environment, and early age of onset. In a national population sample of adolescents, the majority of those with ID met criteria for a lifetime mental disorder. Phobias and bipolar disorder, but not behavior disorders, were elevated in adolescents with ID. Findings highlight the need to consider how behavioral problems are conceptualized and classified in people with ID.", "In complex discrete manufacturing environment, there used to be a poor network and an isolated information island in production line, which led to slow information feedback and low utilization ratio, hindering the construction of enterprise intelligence. To solve these problems, uncertain factors in the production process and demands of sensor network were analyzed; hierarchical topology design method and the deployment strategy of the complexity industrial internet of things were proposed; and a big data analysis model and a system security protection system based on the network were established. The weight of each evaluation index was calculated using analytic hierarchy process, which established the intelligentized evaluation system and model. An actual production scene was also selected to validate the feasibility of the method. A diesel engine production workshop and the enterprise MES were used as an example to establish a network topology. The intelligence level based on both subjective and objective factors were evaluated and analyzed considering both quantitative and qualitative aspects. Analysis results show that the network topology design method and the intelligentize evaluation system were feasible, could improve the intelligence level effectively, and the network framework was expansible.", "Patients with schizophrenia show severe impairment in social function and have difficulty in their daily social life. Although a recent large-scale multicenter study revealed alterations in white matter microstructures, the association between these anatomical changes and social dysfunction in schizophrenia remains unknown. Therefore, we investigated the association between the white matter integrity of regions of interest and social function in schizophrenia. A total of 149 patients with schizophrenia and 602 healthy comparison subjects (HCS) underwent DTI and completed the Picture Arrangement subtest of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Third Edition and the Finance subscale of the University of California, San Diego, Performance-Based Skills Assessment Brief, as social indices of interest. The fractional anisotropy (FA) in the anterior corona radiata and corpus callosum was significantly lower in patients than in HCS, and the radial diffusivity (RD) in the anterior corona radiata and corpus callosum was significantly higher in patients. The Picture Arrangement and Finance scores were both significantly impaired in patients. The effect of the FA of the right anterior corona radiata on the Finance score and the Picture Arrangement score, of the RD of the right anterior corona radiata on the Picture Arrangement score, and of the RD of the corpus callosum on the Picture Arrangement score were significant. In conclusion, our results confirmed the association between structural connectivity in the right frontal white matter and corpus callosum and social function in schizophrenia. These findings may provide a foundation for developing an intervention for functional recovery in schizophrenia.", "Psychologists often note that most people think they are above average in intelligence. We sought robust, contemporary evidence for this \"smarter than average\" effect by asking Americans in two independent samples (total N = 2,821) whether they agreed with the statement, \"I am more intelligent than the average person.\" After weighting each sample to match the demographics of U.S. census data, we found that 65% of Americans believe they are smarter than average, with men more likely to agree than women. However, overconfident beliefs about one's intelligence are not always unrealistic: more educated people were more likely to think their intelligence is above average. We suggest that a tendency to overrate one's cognitive abilities may be a stable feature of human psychology.", "Artificial intelligence (AI)\u00a0has the potential to ease the human resources crisis in healthcare by facilitating diagnostics, decision-making, big data analytics and administration, among others. For this we must first tackle the technological, ethical and legal obstacles.The human resource crisis is widening worldwide, and it is obvious that it is not possible to provide care without workforce. How can disruptive technologies in healthcare help solve the variety of human resource problems? Will technology empower physicians or replace them? How can the medical curriculum, including post-graduate education prepare professionals for the meaningful use of technology? These questions have been growing for decades, and the promise of disruptive technologies filling them is imminent with digital health becoming widespread. Authors of this essay argue that AI might not only fill the human resources gap, but also raises ethical questions we need to deal with today.While there are even more questions to address, our stand is that AI is not meant to replace caregivers, but those who use AI will probably replace those who don't. And it is possible to prepare for that.", "Nowadays, the preservation, maintenance, rehabilitation, and improvement of road networks are key issues. Pavement condition is highly affected by environmental factors such as temperature and humidity, hence the importance of building databases enriched with real-time information from monitoring systems that enable the analysis and modeling of the road properties. Information and communication technologies, and specifically wireless sensor networks and computational intelligence methods, are enabling the design of new monitoring systems. The main goal of this work is the design of a pavement monitoring system for measuring temperature at internal layers. The proposed solution is based on low-cost and robust temperature sensors, vehicle-to-infrastructure communications, allowing one to transmit information directly from probes to a moving auscultation vehicle, and a neural network-based model for prediction pavement temperature. User requirements drive probes&rsquo; design to a modular device, with easy installation, low cost, and reduced energy consumption. Results of the test and validation experiments show both the benefits and viability of the proposed system, which reflect in an accuracy improvement and reduction in routine test duration. Finally, data collected over a year is applied to assess the performance of BELLS3 models and the suggested neural network for predicting pavement temperature. The dynamic behavior of the predicted temperature and the mean absolute error of the neural network-based model are better than the BELL3 model, demonstrating the suitability of the proposed pavement monitoring system.", "Seeing another person's face while that face and one's own face are stroked synchronously or controlling a virtual face by moving one's own induces the illusion that the other face has become a part of oneself-the enfacement effect. Here, we demonstrate that humans can enface even members of another species and that this enfacement promotes \"feature migration\" in terms of intelligence and emotional attribution from the representation of other to the representation of oneself, and vice versa. We presented participants with a virtual human face moving in or out of sync with their own face, and then morphed it into an ape face. Participants tended to perceive the ape face as their own in the sync condition, as indicated by body-ownership and inclusion-of-others-in-the-self ratings. More interestingly, synchrony also reduced performance in a fluid-intelligence task and increased the willingness to attribute emotions to apes. These observations, which fully replicated in another experiment, fit with the idea that self and other are represented in terms of feature codes, just like non-social events (as implied by the Theory of Event Coding), so that representational self-other overlap invites illusory conjunctions of features from one representation to the other.", "Genetic algorithms are integral to a range of applications. They utilise Darwin's theory of evolution to find optimal solutions in large complex spaces such as engineering, to visualise the design space, artificial intelligence, for pattern classification, and financial modelling, improving predictions. Since the original genetic algorithm was developed, new theories have been proposed which are believed to be integral to the evolution of biological systems. However, genetic algorithm development has focused on mathematical or computational methods as the basis for improvements to the mechanisms, moving it away from its original evolutionary inspiration. There is a possibility that the new evolutionary mechanisms are vital to explain how biological systems developed but they are not being incorporated into the genetic algorithm; it is proposed that their inclusion may provide improved performance or interesting feedback to evolutionary theory. Multi-level selection is one example of an evolutionary theory that has not been successfully implemented into the genetic algorithm and these mechanisms are explored in this paper. The resulting multi-level selection genetic algorithm (MLSGA) is unique in that it has different reproduction mechanisms at each level and splits the fitness function between these mechanisms. There are two variants of this theory and these are compared with each other alongside a unified approach. This paper documents the behaviour of the two variants, which show a difference in behaviour especially in terms of the diversity of the population found between each generation. The multi-level selection 1 variant moves rapidly towards the optimal front but with a low diversity amongst its children. The multi-level selection 2 variant shows a slightly slower evolution speed but with a greater diversity of children. The unified selection exhibits a mixed behaviour between the original variants. The different performance of these variants can be utilised to provide specific solvers for different problem types when using the MLSGA methodology.", "Hill (Twin Research and Human Genetics, Vol. 21, 2018, 84-88) presented a critique of our recently published paper in Cell Reports entitled 'Large-Scale Cognitive GWAS Meta-Analysis Reveals Tissue-Specific Neural Expression and Potential Nootropic Drug Targets' (Lam et al., Cell Reports, Vol. 21, 2017, 2597-2613). Specifically, Hill offered several interrelated comments suggesting potential problems with our use of a new analytic method called Multi-Trait Analysis of GWAS (MTAG) (Turley et al., Nature Genetics, Vol. 50, 2018, 229-237). In this brief article, we respond to each of these concerns. Using empirical data, we conclude that our MTAG results do not suffer from 'inflation in the FDR [false discovery rate]', as suggested by Hill (Twin Research and Human Genetics, Vol. 21, 2018, 84-88), and are not 'more relevant to the genetic contributions to education than they are to the genetic contributions to intelligence'.", "A PubMed query run in June 2018 using the keyword 'blockchain' retrieved 40 indexed papers, a reflection of the growing interest in blockchain among the medical and healthcare research and practice communities. Blockchain's foundations of decentralisation, cryptographic security and immutability make it a strong contender in reshaping the healthcare landscape worldwide. Blockchain solutions are currently being explored for: (1) securing patient and provider identities; (2) managing pharmaceutical and medical device supply chains; (3) clinical research and data monetisation; (4) medical fraud detection; (5) public health surveillance; (6) enabling truly public and open geo-tagged data; (7) powering many Internet of Things-connected autonomous devices, wearables, drones and vehicles, via the distributed peer-to-peer apps they run, to deliver the full vision of smart healthy cities and regions; and (8) blockchain-enabled augmented reality in crisis mapping and recovery scenarios, including mechanisms for validating, crediting and rewarding crowdsourced geo-tagged data, among other emerging use cases. Geospatially-enabled blockchain solutions exist today that use a crypto-spatial coordinate system to add an immutable spatial context that regular blockchains lack. These geospatial blockchains do not just record an entry's specific time, but also require and validate its associated proof of location, allowing accurate spatiotemporal mapping of physical world events. Blockchain and distributed ledger technology face similar challenges as any other technology threatening to disintermediate legacy processes and commercial interests, namely the challenges of blockchain interoperability, security and privacy, as well as the need to find suitable and sustainable business models of implementation. Nevertheless, we expect blockchain technologies to get increasingly powerful and robust, as they become coupled with artificial intelligence (AI) in various real-word healthcare solutions involving AI-mediated data exchange on blockchains.", "This study examined key assumptions underlying the interpretation of one of the most widely used multidimensional nonverbal tests of intelligence, the Universal Nonverbal Intelligence Test-Second Edition (UNIT2). Specifically, we examined the dimensionality of the UNIT2 and the interpretive relevance of its factors. We also examined the invariance of constructs measured by the UNIT2 across age groups, gender, race, and ethnicity. Structural analyses were conducted using data from 1,802 individuals aged 5 to 21 years who participated in the norming of the UNIT2. Results indicate that the UNIT2 is primarily a measure of psychometric g. Tests of invariance indicate that the factors measured by the UNIT2 are calibrated differently across age, gender, and racial groups. The Memory, Quantitative, and Reasoning factors represent psychometric g quite well. However, there is insufficient unique, reliable variance for the interpretation of the index scores reflecting the Memory, Quantitative, and Reasoning factors. Based on the results of this study, we question whether the administration of multidimensional nonverbal tests of intelligence is worth the time and effort when unidimensional tests may provide the same information.", "During the first quarter of 2018, Cortellis Competitive Intelligence registered 879 new deals (excluding mergers and acquisitions) with a total disclosed deal value of approximately USD 35.2 billion as part of its ongoing coverage of licensing activity in the life sciences sector. This compares to 1,203 and USD 26.2 bil-lion in the fourth quarter of 2017, and 1,158 and USD 31.8 billion in the first quarter of 2017. This meant a significant increase in the total disclosed deal value compared to these two previous periods (+34% and +10.7%, respectively), and included the USD 5.8 billion pact between Merck and Co. and Eisai which became the highest-value deal in the last 4-year opening quarters. However, during the first quarter of 2018 there was not a high number of signed agreements versus the fourth quarter of 2017 and the first quarter of 2017 (-27% and -24%, respectively), reaching a number similar to that in the first quarter of 2014 with a total of 931 agreements covered.", "Deep learning has led to a paradigm shift in artificial intelligence, including web, text, and image search, speech recognition, as well as bioinformatics, with growing impact in chemical physics. Machine learning, in general, and deep learning, in particular, are ideally suitable for representing quantum-mechanical interactions, enabling us to model nonlinear potential-energy surfaces or enhancing the exploration of chemical compound space. Here we present the deep learning architecture SchNet that is specifically designed to model atomistic systems by making use of continuous-filter convolutional layers. We demonstrate the capabilities of SchNet by accurately predicting a range of properties across chemical space for molecules and materials, where our model learns chemically plausible embeddings of atom types across the periodic table. Finally, we employ SchNet to predict potential-energy surfaces and energy-conserving force fields for molecular dynamics simulations of small molecules and perform an exemplary study on the quantum-mechanical properties of C20-fullerene that would have been infeasible with regular ab initio molecular dynamics.", "Negative symptoms and neurocognitive performance have been reported to be negatively associated in patients with emerging psychosis. However, most previous studies focused on patients with frank psychosis and did not differentiate between subdomains of negative symptoms. Hence, we aimed to elucidate the specific relationship between negative symptoms and cognitive functioning in patients at clinical high risk (CHR) for psychosis. Data from 154 CHR patients collected within the prospective Fr\u00fcherkennung von Psychosen (FePsy) study were analyzed. Negative symptoms were assessed with the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS) and cognitive functioning with an extensive neuropsychological test battery. Regression analyses revealed significant negative associations between negative symptoms and cognitive functioning, particularly in the domains of nonverbal intelligence and verbal fluency. When analyzing each negative symptom domain separately, alogia and asociality/anhedonia were significantly negatively associated with nonverbal intelligence and alogia additionally with verbal fluency. Overall, our results in CHR patients are similar to those reported in patients with frank psychosis. The strong negative association between verbal fluency and negative symptoms may be indicative of an overlap between these constructs. Verbal fluency might have a strong influence on the clinical impression of negative symptoms (particularly alogia) and vice versa.", "A scientometric analysis as part of a Competitive Technology Intelligence methodology was used to determine the main research efforts in 3D bioprinting. Papers from Scopus and Web of Science (WoS) published between 2000 and 2017 were analysed. A network map of the most frequently occurring keywords in these articles was created, and their average publication year (APY) was determined. The analysis focused on the most relevant keywords that occurred at least five times. A total of 1,759 keywords were obtained, and a co-occurrence analysis was developed for APYs with more keywords: 2011-2016. The results indicated that Polylactic Acid (PLA) is the material used most often. Applications mainly focused on bone tissue engineering and regeneration. The most frequently used technique was inkjet printing, and the main cell sources were Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSC). From a general perspective, 'Treatment' and 'Bioink' were the most frequent keywords. The former was mainly related to cancer, regenerative medicine, and MSC and the latter, to multicellular spheroid deposition and the use of hydrogels like GelMA (gelatin methacryloyl). This analysis provides insights to stakeholders involved in 3D bioprinting research and development who need to keep abreast of scientific progress in the field.", "Evidence that artificial intelligence (AI) is useful for predicting risk factors for hypertension and its management is emerging. However, we are far from harnessing the innovative AI tools to predict these risk factors for hypertension and applying them to personalized management. This review summarizes recent advances in the computer science and medical field, illustrating the innovative AI approach for potential prediction of early stages of hypertension. Additionally, we review ongoing research and future implications of AI in hypertension management and clinical trials, with an eye towards personalized medicine.\nAlthough recent studies demonstrate that AI in hypertension research is feasible and possibly useful, AI-informed care has yet to transform blood pressure (BP) control. This is due, in part, to lack of data on AI's consistency, accuracy, and reliability in the BP sphere. However, many factors contribute to poorly controlled BP, including biological, environmental, and lifestyle issues. AI allows insight into extrapolating data analytics to inform prescribers and patients about specific factors that may impact their BP control. To date, AI has been mainly used to investigate risk factors for hypertension, but has not yet been utilized for hypertension management due to the limitations of study design and of physician's engagement in computer science literature. The future of AI with more robust architecture using multi-omics approaches and wearable technology will likely be an important tool allowing to incorporate biological, lifestyle, and environmental factors into decision-making of appropriate drug use for BP control.", "The acquisition of new semantic memories is sometimes preserved in patients with hippocampal amnesia. Robust evidence for this comes from case reports of developmental amnesia suggesting that low-to-normal levels of semantic knowledge can be achieved despite compromised episodic learning. However, it is unclear whether this relative preservation of semantic memory results from normal acquisition and retrieval or from residual episodic memory, combined with effortful repetition. Furthermore, lesion studies have mainly focused on the hippocampus itself, and have seldom reported the state of structures in the extended hippocampal system. Preserved components of this system may therefore mediate residual episodic abilities, contributing to the apparent semantic preservation. We report an in-depth study of Patient KA, a 27-year-old man who had severe hypoxia at birth, in which we carefully explored his residual episodic learning abilities. We used novel speeded recognition paradigms to assess whether KA could explicitly acquire and retrieve new context-free memories. Despite a pattern of very severe amnesia, with a 44-point discrepancy between his intelligence and memory quotients, KA exhibited normal-to-superior levels of knowledge, even under strict time constraints. He also exhibited normal-to-superior recognition memory for new material, again under strict time constraints. Multimodal neuroimaging revealed an unusual pattern of selective atrophy within each component of the extended hippocampal system, contrasting with the preservation of anterior subhippocampal cortices. A cortical thickness analysis yielded a pattern of thinner but also thicker regional cortices, pointing toward specific temporal lobe reorganization following early injury. We thus report the first case of superior explicit learning and memory in a severe case of amnesia, raising important questions about how such knowledge can be acquired.", "Human footsteps can provide a unique behavioural pattern for robust biometric systems. We propose spatio-temporal footstep representations from floor-only sensor data in advanced computational models for automatic biometric verification. Our models deliver an artificial intelligence capable of effectively differentiating the fine-grained variability of footsteps between legitimate users (clients) and impostor users of the biometric system. The methodology is validated in the largest to date footstep database, containing nearly 20,000 footstep signals from more than 120 users. The database is organized by considering a large cohort of impostors and a small set of clients to verify the reliability of biometric systems. We provide experimental results in 3 critical data-driven security scenarios, according to the amount of footstep data made available for model training: at airports security checkpoints (smallest training set), workspace environments (medium training set) and home environments (largest training set). We report state-of-the-art footstep recognition rates with an optimal equal false acceptance and false rejection rate (equal error rate) of 0.7 percent an improvement ratio of 371 percent compared to previous state-of-the-art. We perform a feature analysis of deep residual neural networks showing effective clustering of client's footstep data and to provide insights of the feature learning process.", "Human activity recognition (HAR) is a research hotspot in the field of artificial intelligence and pattern recognition. The electrooculography (EOG)-based HAR system has attracted much attention due to its good realizability and great application potential. Focusing on the signal processing method of the EOG-HAR system, we propose a robust EOG-based saccade recognition using the multi-channel convolutional independent component analysis (ICA) method. To establish frequency-domain observation vectors, short-time Fourier transform (STFT) is used to process time-domain EOG signals by applying the sliding window technique. Subsequently, we apply the joint approximative diagonalization of eigenmatrix (JADE) algorithm to separate the mixed signals and choose the \"clean\" saccadic source to extract features. To address the problem of permutation ambiguity in a case with a six-channel condition, we developed a constraint direction of arrival (DOA) algorithm that can automatically adjust the order of eye movement sources according to the constraint angle. Recognition experiments of four different saccadic EOG signals (i.e. up, down, left and right) were conducted in a laboratory environment. The average recognition ratios over 13 subjects were 95.66% and 97.33% under the between-subjects test and the within-subjects test, respectively. Compared with \"bandpass filtering\", \"wavelet denoising\", \"extended infomax algorithm\", \"frequency-domain JADE algorithm\" and \"time-domain JADE algorithm, the recognition ratios obtained relative increments of 4.6%, 3.49%, 2.85%, 2.81% and 2.91% (within-subjects test) and 4.91%, 3.43%, 2.21%, 2.24% and 2.28% (between-subjects test), respectively. The experimental results revealed that the proposed algorithm presents robust classification performance in saccadic EOG signal recognition.", "Health information technology, applied to electronic health record (EHR), has evolved with the adoption of standards for defining patient health records. However, there are many standards for defining such data, hindering communication between different healthcare providers. Even with adopted standards, patients often need to repeatedly provide their health information when they are taken care of at different locations. This problem hinders the adoption of personal health record (PHR), with the patients' health records under their own control. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to propose an interoperability model for PHR use. The methodology consisted prototyping an application model named OmniPHR, to evaluate the structuring of semantic interoperability and integration of different health standards, using a real database from anonymized patients. We evaluated health data from a hospital database with 38\u00a0645 adult patients' medical records processed using different standards, represented by openEHR, HL7 FHIR, and MIMIC-III reference models. OmniPHR demonstrated the feasibility to provide interoperability through a standard ontology and artificial intelligence with natural language processing (NLP). Although the first executions reached a 76.39% F1-score and required retraining of the machine-learning process, the final score was 87.9%, presenting a way to obtain the original data from different standards on a single format. Unlike other models, OmniPHR presents a unified, structural semantic and up-to-date vision of PHR for patients and healthcare providers. The results were promising and demonstrated the possibility of subsidizing the creation of inferences rules about possible patient health problems or preventing future problems.", "The purpose of this study was to determine those components of working memory (WM) that play a significant role in predicting math growth in children who are English language learners (N = 157) with serious math difficulties (MD).\nA battery of tests was administered in English and Spanish that assessed computation, reading, vocabulary, inhibition, and components of WM in Grade 1 children with follow-up testing in Grades 2 and 3.\nThe results indicated that growth in the executive component of WM was related to growth in math performance. Proficient bilingual children (proficient in both Spanish and English vocabulary) with MD outperformed less proficient bilingual children with MD on measures of math calculation, fluid intelligence, reading, and Spanish WM at Grade 3.\nGrowth in the executive component of WM is significantly related to growth in math computation, and increased bilingual proficiency across testing waves yielded positive gains in both math and cognitive performance in children with MD.", "Excessive internet use is shown to be cross sectionally associated with lower cognitive functioning and reduced volume of several brain areas. However, the effects of daily internet use on the development of verbal intelligence and brain structures have not been investigated. Here, we cross sectionally examined the effects of the frequency of internet use on regional gray/white matter volume (rGMV/rWMV) and verbal intelligence as well as their longitudinal changes after 3.0\u2009\u00b1\u20090.3 (standard deviation) years in a large sample of children recruited from the general population (mean age, 11.2\u2009\u00b1\u20093.1\u2009years; range, 5.7-18.4\u2009years). Although there were no significant associations in cross sectional analyses, a higher frequency of internet use was found to be associated with decrease of verbal intelligence and smaller increase in rGMV and rWMV of widespread brain areas after a few years in longitudinal analyses. These areas involve areas related to language processing, attention and executive functions, emotion, and reward. In conclusion, frequent internet use is directly or indirectly associated with decrease of verbal intelligence and development to smaller gray matter volume at later stages.", "In the recent years, we have been witnessing a digital revolution in public and global health creating unprecedented opportunities for epidemic intelligence and public health emergencies. However, these opportunities created a double edge sword as access to data, quality monitoring and assurance, as well as governance and regulation frameworks for data privacy are lagging behind technological achievements.In this paper we identify three ethical challenges: sharing data across various early warning tools to support risk assessment. Secondly, define the challenges to be addressed by the legal frameworks for public health data sharing to unlock the potential of population-level datasets for research with no impact on citizens privacy. The third challenge lies with stricter regulation of the IT industry with regards to manipulating user data - such an initiative, GDPR, comes to force in the EU in May 2018.", "The association of micronutrient supplementation during pregnancy with the intellectual development of adolescent offspring is unknown.\nTo assess the long-term association of antenatal micronutrient supplementation with adolescent intellectual development.\nThis 14-year follow-up study of a randomized clinical trial of micronutrient supplementation in pregnancy was conducted in 2 counties in rural western China in 2118 adolescent offspring (aged 10 to 14 years) of mothers who were randomized to take a daily capsule of either folic acid, folic acid plus iron, or multiple micronutrients from August 1, 2002, through February 28, 2006. Follow-up was conducted from June 1, 2016, through December 31, 2016. Data analyses took place from April 1, 2017, to June 20, 2017.\nAdolescent full-scale intelligence quotient and aspects of verbal comprehension, working memory, perceptual reasoning, and processing speed indexes were assessed by the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children.\nOf 2118 adolescent offspring, 1252 (59.1%) were boys and 866 (40.9%) were girls, with a mean (SD) age of 11.7 (0.87) years, representing 47.2% of the 4488 single live births that were eligible to participate. Compared with folic acid supplementation, multiple micronutrient supplementation was associated with a 1.13-point higher full-scale intelligence quotient (95% CI, 0.15-2.10) and a 2.03-point higher verbal comprehension index (95% CI, 0.61-3.45); similar results were found in comparison with folic acid plus iron. When mothers initiated supplementation early (<12 weeks of gestation) and had an adequate dose (\u2265180 capsules), multiple micronutrient capsules were associated with a 2.16-point higher full-scale intelligence quotient (95% CI, 0.41-3.90) and 4.29-point higher verbal comprehension index (95% CI, 1.33-7.24) compared with folic acid capsules. The mean test scores were lower in the substratum of supplementation initiated late (\u226512 weeks of gestation) and with an inadequate dose (<180 capsules). The multiple micronutrient group had higher scores than the other 2 treatment groups, and significant differences were observed for full-scale intelligence quotient (adjusted mean difference, 2.46; 95% CI, 0.98-3.94) when compared with the folic acid plus iron group.\nCompared with folic acid plus iron or folic acid capsules supplementation, antenatal multiple micronutrient supplementation appeared to be associated with increased adolescent intellectual development; initiating supplementation in the first trimester and then continuing for at least 180 days were associated with the greatest rewards.\nisrctn.org Identifier: ISRCTN08850194.", "The impact of attention problems on academic and social functioning coupled with the large number of children failing to respond to stimulant medication or behavioral therapy makes adjunctive therapies such as cognitive training appealing for families and clinicians of children with attention difficulties or childhood attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. However, the results of cognitive training studies have failed to find far transfer effects with this population. This study examined the quantitative cognitive effects and parent-reported behavioral effects of a clinician-delivered cognitive training program with children who have attention problems.\nUsing a randomized controlled study design, we examined the impact of a clinician-delivered cognitive training program on processing speed, fluid reasoning, memory, visual processing, auditory processing, attention, overall intelligence quotient score, and behavior of students (n=13) aged 8-14 years with attention problems. Participants were randomly assigned to either a waitlist control group or a treatment group for 60 hours of cognitive training with ThinkRx, a clinician-delivered intervention that targets multiple cognitive skills with game-like, but rigorous mental tasks in 60-90-minute training sessions at least 3 days per week.\nResults included greater mean pretest to posttest change scores on all variables for the treatment group versus the control group with statistically significant differences noted in working memory, long-term memory, logic and reasoning, auditory processing, and intelligence quotient score. Qualitative outcomes included parent-reported changes in confidence, cooperation, and self-discipline.\nChildren with attention problems who completed 60 hours of clinician-delivered ThinkRx cognitive training realized both cognitive and behavioral improvements.", "One of the challenges in writing an article reviewing the current state of cyber education and workforce development is that there is a paucity of quantitative assessment regarding the cognitive aptitudes, work roles, or team organization required by cybersecurity professionals to be successful. In this review, we argue that the people who operate within the cyber domain need a combination of technical skills, domain specific knowledge, and social intelligence to be successful. They, like the networks they operate, must also be reliable, trustworthy, and resilient. Defining the knowledge, skills, attributes, and other characteristics is not as simple as defining a group of technical skills that people can be trained on; the complexity of the cyber domain makes this a unique challenge. There has been little research devoted to exactly what attributes individuals in the cyber domain need. What research does exist places an emphasis on technical and engineering skills while discounting the important social and organizational influences that dictate success or failure in everyday settings. This paper reviews the literature on cyber expertise and cyber workforce development to identify gaps and then argues for the important contribution of social fit in the highly complex and heterogenous cyber workforce. We then identify six assumptions for the future of cybersecurity workforce development, including the requirement for systemic thinkers, team players, a love for continued learning, strong communication ability, a sense of civic duty, and a blend of technical and social skill. Finally, we make recommendations for social and cognitive metrics which may be indicative of future performance in cyber work roles to provide a roadmap for future scholars.", "Grades often decline during the high school transition, creating stress. The present research integrates the biopsychosocial model of challenge and threat with the implicit theories model to understand who shows maladaptive stress responses. A diary study measured declines in grades in the first few months of high school: salivary cortisol (N\u00a0=\u00a0360 students, N\u00a0=\u00a03,045 observations) and daily stress appraisals (N\u00a0=\u00a0499 students, N\u00a0=\u00a03,854 observations). Students who reported an entity theory of intelligence (i.e., the belief that intelligence is fixed) showed higher cortisol when grades were declining. Moreover, daily academic stressors showed a different lingering effect on the next day's cortisol for those with different implicit theories. Findings support a process model through which beliefs affect biological stress responses during difficult adolescent transitions.", "We discuss a recently proposed approach to solve the classic feature-binding problem in primate vision that uses neural dynamics known to be present within the visual cortex. Broadly, the feature-binding problem in the visual context concerns not only how a hierarchy of features such as edges and objects within a scene are represented, but also the hierarchical relationships between these features at every spatial scale across the visual field. This is necessary for the visual brain to be able to make sense of its visuospatial world. Solving this problem is an important step towards the development of artificial general intelligence. In neural network simulation studies, it has been found that neurons encoding the binding relations between visual features, known as binding neurons, emerge during visual training when key properties of the visual cortex are incorporated into the models. These biological network properties include (i) bottom-up, lateral and top-down synaptic connections, (ii) spiking neuronal dynamics, (iii) spike timing-dependent plasticity, and (iv) a random distribution of axonal transmission delays (of the order of several milliseconds) in the propagation of spikes between neurons. After training the network on a set of visual stimuli, modelling studies have reported observing the gradual emergence of polychronization through successive layers of the network, in which subpopulations of neurons have learned to emit their spikes in regularly repeating spatio-temporal patterns in response to specific visual stimuli. Such a subpopulation of neurons is known as a polychronous neuronal group (PNG). Some neurons embedded within these PNGs receive convergent inputs from neurons representing lower- and higher-level visual features, and thus appear to encode the hierarchical binding relationship between features. Neural activity with this kind of spatio-temporal structure robustly emerges in the higher network layers even when neurons in the input layer represent visual stimuli with spike timings that are randomized according to a Poisson distribution. The resulting hierarchical representation of visual scenes in such models, including the representation of hierarchical binding relations between lower- and higher-level visual features, is consistent with the hierarchical phenomenology or subjective experience of primate vision and is distinct from approaches interested in segmenting a visual scene into a finite set of objects.", "Modern radiotherapy (RT) is being enriched by big digital data and intensive technology. Multimodality image registration, intelligence-guided planning, real-time tracking, image-guided RT (IGRT), and automatic follow-up surveys are the products of the digital era. Enormous digital data are created in the process of treatment, including benefits and risks. Generally, decision making in RT tries to balance these two aspects, which is based on the archival and retrieving of data from various platforms. However, modern risk-based analysis shows that many errors that occur in radiation oncology are due to failures in workflow. These errors can lead to imbalance between benefits and risks. In addition, the exact mechanism and dose-response relationship for radiation-induced malignancy are not well understood. The cancer risk in modern RT workflow continues to be a problem. Therefore, in this review, we develop risk assessments based on our current knowledge of IGRT and provide strategies for cancer risk reduction. Artificial intelligence (AI) such as machine learning is also discussed because big data are transforming RT via AI.", "Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI) is a heterogeneous condition mainly characterised by bone fragility; intelligence is reported to be normal. However, a minority of children seen also show symptomology consistent with an 'Autism Spectrum Disorder'. A joint genetics and psychology research study was undertaken to identify these patients using 'Gold Standard' research tools: Autism Diagnostic Inventory Revised (ADI-R); Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) and undertake genetic analyses in them.\nA cohort of n\u202f=\u202f7 children with autistic traits and severe/complex OI were recruited to the study. The study was set-up to explore whether there was a genetic link between bone fragility and autism in a sub-set of patients with bone fragility identified with autism traits in our complex/severe OI clinic. This was not set-up as a prevalence study but rather an exploration of genetics in association with ADI/ADOS confirmed ASD and bone fragility.\nStandardised tools were used to confirm autism diagnosis. ADI and ADOS were completed by the Clinical Psychologist; ADI comprises a 93 item semi-structured clinical review with a diagnostic algorithm diagnosing Autism; ADOS is a semi-structured assessment of socialisation, communication and play/imagination which also provides a diagnostic algorithm.\nIn patients recruited, those that fulfilled research criteria for diagnosis of autism using above tools were recruited to trio whole exome sequencing (WES).\none patient had compound heterozygous variants in NBAS; one patient had a variant in NRX1; one patient had a maternally inherited PLS3 variant; all the other patients in this cohort had pathogenic variants in COL1A1/COL1A2.\nAlthough, not set out as an objective, we were able to establish that identifying autism had important clinical and social benefits for patients and their families in ensuring access to services, appropriate schooling, increased understanding of behaviour and support.\nIt is important for clinicians looking after children with brittle bone disease, also referred to as Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI) to be aware of early features of developmental delay/autistic traits especially with severe forms of OI as the emphasis is on their mobility and bone health. Ensuring appropriate assessment and access to services early-on will enable these patients to achieve their potential. Further investigations of genomics in bone fragility in relation to autism are required and dual diagnosis is essential for high quality clinical and educational provision.", "This paper presents a method for exploring structural risk of any artificial intelligence-based method in bioinformatics, the A-Test method. This method provides a way to not only quantitate the structural risk associated with a classification method, but provides a graphical representation to compare the learning capacity of different classification methods. Two different methods, Deep Time Growing Neural Network (DTGNN) and Hidden Markov Model (HMM), are selected as two classification methods for comparison. Time series of heart sound signals are employed as the case study where the classifiers are trained to learn the disease-related changes. Results showed that the DTGNN offers a superior performance both in terms of the capacity and the structural risk. The A-Test method can be especially employed in comparing the learning methods with small data size.", "Individual differences in Cattell-Horn-Carroll (CHC) cognitive abilities are related to individual differences in math problem solving. However, it is less clear whether cognitive abilities are associated with math problem solving directly or indirectly via math component skills and whether these relations differ across grade levels. We used multigroup structural equation models to examine direct and indirect CHC-based cognitive ability relations with math problem solving across six grade-level groups using the Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children, Second Edition and the Kaufman Tests of Educational Achievement, Second Edition co-normed standardization sample data (N = 2,117). After testing factorial invariance of the cognitive constructs across grade levels, we assessed whether the main findings were similar across higher-order and bifactor models. In the higher-order model, the Crystallized Ability, Visual Processing, and Short-Term Memory constucts had direct and indirect relations with math problem solving, whereas the Learning Efficiency and Retrieval Fluency constructs had only indirect relations with math problem solving via math computation. The integrated cognitive ability and math achievement relations were generally consistent across the CHC models of intelligence. In the higher-order model, the g factor operated indirectly on math computation and math problem solving, whereas in the bifactor model, the first-order G factor had direct relations with math computation and math problem solving. In both models, g/G was the most consistent and largest cognitive predictor of math skills. Last, the relation of math computation with math problem solving increased as grade level increased. Theoretical implications for math development and considerations for school psychologists are discussed.

Neurocognitive function, academic achievement, parent-reported health outcome surveys, and height and weight were measured.\nBMI category at 10 years of age was not associated with differences in intelligence, language, or academic achievement. Parents of children with obesity were more likely to report their child had asthma (OR 2.2; 95% CI 1.4-3.5), fair/poor general health (OR 3.2; 95% CI 1.4-7.5), and decreased physical function (OR 1.7; 95% CI 1.1-2.9) but less likely to have physician diagnosed attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (OR 0.5; 95% CI 0.3-0.97) or an individualized education plan (OR 0.6; 95% CI 0.4-0.99).\nAmong children born extremely preterm, an elevated BMI, compared with normal or low BMI, is not associated with a difference in neurocognitive function. However, asthma, fair/poor general health, and decreased physical function were more prevalent among study participants with obesity, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and individualized education plan were less prevalent.", "Advice-giving has been long explored in the artificial intelligence community to build robust learning algorithms when the data is noisy, incorrect or even insufficient. While logic based systems were effectively used in building expert systems, the role of the human has been restricted to being a \"mere labeler\" in recent times. We hypothesize and demonstrate that probabilistic logic can provide an effective and natural way for the expert to specify domain advice. Specifically, we consider different types of advice-giving in relational domains where noise could arise due to systematic errors or class-imbalance inherent in the domains. The advice is provided as logical statements or privileged features that are thenexplicitly considered by an iterative learning algorithm at every update. Our empirical evidence shows that human advice can effectively accelerate learning in noisy, structured domains where so far humans have been merely used as labelers or as designers of the (initial or final) structure of the model.", "While chiropractors are integrating into multidisciplinary settings with increasing frequency, the perceptions of medical providers and patients toward adding chiropractors to existing healthcare teams is not well-understood. This study explored the qualities preferred in a chiropractor by key stakeholders in a neurorehabilitation setting.\nThis qualitative analysis was part of a multi-phase, organizational case study designed to evaluate the planned integration of a chiropractor into a multidisciplinary rehabilitation team. The setting was a 62-bed rehabilitation specialty hospital located in the northeastern United States. Participants included patients, families, community members, and professional staff of the administrative, medical, nursing, and therapy departments. Data collection consisted of audiotaped, individual interviews and profession-specific focus groups guided by a semi-structured interview schedule. Transcripts were imported into a qualitative data analysis program for data analysis. An iterative coding process using thematic content analysis categorized key themes and domains.\nSixty participants were interviewed in June 2015, including 48 staff members, 6 patients, 4 family members, and 2 community members. Our analysis generated a conceptual model of The Preferred Chiropractor for Multidisciplinary Rehabilitation Settings composed of 5 domains and 13 themes. The central domain, Patient-Centeredness, or the provision of healthcare that is respectful, responsive, and inclusive of the patient's values, preferences, and needs, was mentioned in all interviews and linked to all other themes. The Professional Qualities domain highlighted clinical acumen, efficacious treatment, and being a safe practitioner. Interpersonal Qualities encouraged chiropractors to offer patients their comforting patience, familiar connections, and emotional intelligence. Interprofessional Qualities emphasized teamwork, resourcefulness, and openness to feedback as characteristics to enhance the chiropractor's ability to work within an interdisciplinary setting. Organizational Qualities, including personality fit, institutional compliance, and mission alignment were important attributes for working in a specific healthcare organization.\nOur findings provide an expanded view of the qualities that chiropractors might bring to multidisciplinary healthcare settings. Rather than labeling stakeholder perceptions as good, bad or indifferent as in previous studies, these results highlight specific attributes chiropractors might cultivate to enhance the patient outcomes and the experience of healthcare, influence clinical decision-making and interprofessional teamwork, and impact healthcare organizations.", "The aim of this work was to develop computational intelligence models based on neural networks (NN), fuzzy models (FM), and support vector machines (SVM) to predict physicochemical composition of bee pollen mixture given their botanical origin. To obtain the predominant plant genus of pollen (was the output variable), based on physicochemical composition (were the input variables of the predictive model), prediction models were learned from data. For the inverse case study, input/output variables were swapped. The probabilistic NN prediction model obtained 98.4% of correct classification of the predominant plant genus of pollen. To obtain the secondary and tertiary plant genus of pollen, the results present a lower accuracy. To predict the physicochemical characteristic of a mixture of bee pollen, given their botanical origin, fuzzy models proven the best results with small prediction errors, and variability lower than 10%.", "The article describes my research on the development and evaluation of psychosocial treatments for children who engage in extremes of antisocial behavior (e.g., aggression, property destruction, theft). I begin with my \"story\" of how the focus on interventions started as I worked in various settings (rehabilitation facilities, schools, hospitals, and outpatient clinical services) and with children, adolescents, and adults. The main stream of treatment research and findings with antisocial child behavior is highlighted along with tributaries that led naturally from the outcome research. Our trials are complemented by tribulations that apply to evidence-based psychosocial interventions more broadly. Most individuals in need of psychological services in the United States and worldwide receive no treatment. Much can be done right now with novel models of treatment delivery that draw on multiple disciplines (e.g., public health, business, entertainment, economics, robotics and artificial intelligence, and law and social policy). More research on interventions that do not or cannot reach most people in need is quite limited in value to me. Finally (and belatedly) my attention has turned to ways of exerting impact, and for that, evidence-based interventions are necessary but hardly sufficient.", "Machine learning, the core of artificial intelligence and big data science, is one of today's most rapidly growing interdisciplinary fields. Recently, machine learning tools and techniques have been adopted to tackle intricate quantum many-body problems. In this Letter, we introduce machine learning techniques to the detection of quantum nonlocality in many-body systems, with a focus on the restricted-Boltzmann-machine (RBM) architecture. Using reinforcement learning, we demonstrate that RBM is capable of finding the maximum quantum violations of multipartite Bell inequalities with given measurement settings. Our results build a novel bridge between computer-science-based machine learning and quantum many-body nonlocality, which will benefit future studies in both areas.", "To assess the budget impact to a US commercial health plan of providing access to the Flexitouch (FLX) advanced pneumatic compression device (Tactile Medical) to lymphedema (LE) patients with either comorbid chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) or frequent infections.\nBudget impact was calculated over 2 years for a hypothetical US payer with 10-million commercial members. Model inputs were derived from published sources and from a case-matched analysis of Blue Health Intelligence (BHI) claims data for the years 2012-2016. To calculate the budget impact, the Status Quo budget (i.e. total cost for LE and sequelae-related medical treatment) was compared to the budget under each of three Alternate Payer Policy scenarios which assumed that a sub-set of patients was redistributed from their initial treatment groups to a group that received FLX. Model outputs included cumulative payer costs, net budget impact, and breakeven point. Sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the impact of model inputs on results.\nIncreasing access to FLX yielded a favorable budget impact in every scenario. For LE patients with comorbid CVI, the three alternate scenarios resulted in cumulative 2-year budget impacts of -$52,841, -$173,317, and -$375,601, respectively. For LE patients with comorbid frequent infections, the three alternate scenarios resulted in cumulative 2-year budget impacts of -$192,729, -$259,339, and -$613,179, respectively.\nUse of claims data assumes accurate coding and does not allow one to control for disease severity or treatment adherence. Also, the distribution of patients between treatment arms was determined using claims data from a specific payer organization, and could differ for health plans with different coverage policies.\nWhile previous studies have illustrated cost savings with adoption of FLX, US commercial health plans may also achieve tangible cost savings by expanding access to FLX for LE patients with comorbid CVI and multiple infections.", "Protein essentiality is fundamental to comprehend the function and evolution of genes. The prediction of protein essentiality is pivotal in identifying disease genes and potential drug targets. Since the experimental methods need many investments in time and funds, it is of great value to predict protein essentiality with high accuracy using computational methods. In this study, we present a novel feature selection named Elite Search mechanism-based Flower Pollination Algorithm (ESFPA) to determine protein essentiality. Unlike other protein essentiality prediction methods, ESFPA uses an improved swarm intelligence\u207bbased algorithm for feature selection and selects optimal features for protein essentiality prediction. The first step is to collect numerous features with the highly predictive characteristics of essentiality. The second step is to develop a feature selection strategy based on a swarm intelligence algorithm to obtain the optimal feature subset. Furthermore, an elite search mechanism is adopted to further improve the quality of feature subset. Subsequently a hybrid classifier is applied to evaluate the essentiality for each protein. Finally, the experimental results show that our method is competitive to some well-known feature selection methods. The proposed method aims to provide a new perspective for protein essentiality determination.", "We determine an optimal protocol for temozolomide using population variability and dynamic optimization techniques inspired by artificial intelligence. We use a Pharmacokinetics/Pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) model based on Faivre and coauthors (Faivre, et al., 2013) for the pharmacokinetics of temozolomide, as well as the pharmacodynamics of its efficacy. For toxicity, which is measured by the nadir of the normalized absolute neutrophil count, we formalize the myelosuppression effect of temozolomide with the physiological model of Panetta and coauthors (Panetta, et al., 2003). We apply the model to a population with variability as given in Panetta and coauthors (Panetta, et al., 2003). Our optimization algorithm is a variant in the class of Monte-Carlo tree search algorithms. We do not impose periodicity constraint on our solution. We set the objective of tumor size minimization while not allowing more severe toxicity levels than the standard Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) regimen. The protocol we propose achieves higher efficacy in the sense that -compared to the usual MTD regimen- it divides the tumor size by approximately 7.66 after 336 days -the 95% confidence interval being [7.36-7.97]. The toxicity is similar to MTD. Overall, our protocol, obtained with a very flexible method, gives significant results for the present case of temozolomide and calls for further research mixing operational research or artificial intelligence and clinical research in oncology.", "Creativity is necessary to human survival, human prosperity, civilization and well-being. Visual creativity is an important part of creativity and is the ability to create products of novel and useful visual forms, playing important role in many fields such as art, painting and sculpture. There have been several neuroimaging studies exploring the neural basis of visual creativity. However, to date, little is known about the relationship between cortical structure and visual creativity as measured by the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking. Here, we investigated the association between cortical thickness and visual creativity in a large sample of 310 healthy adults. We used multiple regression to analyze the correlation between cortical thickness and visual creativity, adjusting for gender, age and general intelligence. The results showed that visual creativity was significantly negatively correlated with cortical thickness in the left middle frontal gyrus (MFG), right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), right supplementary motor cortex (SMA) and the left insula. These observations have implications for understanding that a thinner prefrontal cortex (PFC) (e.g. IFG, MFG), SMA and insula correspond to higher visual creative performance, presumably due to their role in executive attention, cognitive control, motor planning and dynamic switching.", "A wealth of literature has examined the association between breastfeeding and the development of cognitive abilities in childhood. In particular, at least some evidence exists suggesting that breastfed children perform better on measures of intelligence later in life. Although a correlation appears to be present, fewer observational studies have included appropriate adjustment for potentially confounding variables; maternal intelligence, maternal education, and cognitive stimulation provided by mothers being chief among them. As a result, we analyze a national sample of approximately 790 American respondents to test the association between breastfeeding and intelligence during childhood and adolescence using multiple intelligence tests and controlling for a range of key covariates. Our results suggest that the correlation between breastfeeding throughout the first six months of life and intelligence is statistically significant and consistent, yet of substantively minor impact. (PsycINFO Database Record", "Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is caused by a mutation in the FMR1 gene on the X chromosome, leading to decreased levels of FMR1 protein (FMRP), which causes the array of neuropsychological impairments that define FXS. Because FXS is an X-linked condition, fewer females display FXS and females with FXS are more mildly affected than males, on average. However, there is a considerable variability in terms of severity of affectedness among females with FXS. The current study was designed to investigate potential genetic (FMRP level and ratio of affected to total chromosomes) and environmental factors (maternal psychological distress and closeness in the mother-child relationship) influencing the cognitive (fluid and crystallized intelligence) and behavioral (anxiety and withdrawal) phenotype of females with FXS.\nWe conducted a prospective 3-year longitudinal study of 16 females with FXS (with up to four assessments, each separated by a year) using an accelerated longitudinal design so that we had coverage of the age range of 10-15\u00a0years at study start and 13-18 at study end. We focused on both the level of functioning related to chronological age expectations (standard scores) and absolute change in skill (raw scores) over the 3-year period.\nAt a cross-sectional level, fluid intelligence and crystallized intelligence were both predicted by a closer mother-child relationship and lower maternal psychological distress. However, only fluid intelligence was predicted by a lower ratio of affected to total chromosomes. Anxiety and withdrawal were predicted by a higher ratio of affected to total chromosomes. Withdrawal was also predicted by lower closeness in the mother-child relationship and higher maternal distress. In terms of longitudinal change, gains were observed in fluid and crystallized intelligence, whereas anxious and withdrawn behaviors remained stable over visits. Gains in fluid intelligence were solely predicted by FXS biomarkers (higher FMRP level and lower ratio of affected to total chromosomes), while gains in crystallized intelligence were not predicted by any of the biological and environmental variables.\nOur results show that FXS biomarkers and maternal variables contribute differentially to the cognitive and behavioral features of the adolescent female with FXS. These findings can help in the design of treatment studies aimed at enhancing cognitive and behavioral abilities in the FXS population.", "We describe a form of moral artificial intelligence that could be used to improve human moral decision-making. We call it the \"artificial moral advisor\" (AMA). The AMA would implement a quasi-relativistic version of the \"ideal observer\" famously described by Roderick Firth. We describe similarities and differences between the AMA and Firth's ideal observer. Like Firth's ideal observer, the AMA is disinterested, dispassionate, and consistent in its judgments. Unlike Firth's observer, the AMA is non-absolutist, because it would take into account the human agent's own principles and values. We argue that the AMA would respect and indeed enhance individuals' moral autonomy, help individuals achieve wide and a narrow reflective equilibrium, make up for the limitations of human moral psychology in a way that takes conservatives' objections to human bioenhancement seriously, and implement the positive functions of intuitions and emotions in human morality without their downsides, such as biases and prejudices.", "Dysregulation of cell metabolism and redox balance is implicated in the pathogenesis and progression of cancer and autoimmune diseases. Because the cell proliferation and apoptotic regulatory pathways are interconnected with metabolic and redox signalling pathways, the current mono-target treatment is ineffective, and multi-drug resistance remains common. Complex diseases are often implicated in a network-based context of pathology; therefore, a new holistic intervention approach is required to block multi-crosstalk in such complicated circumstances. The use of therapeutic agents isolated from herbs to holistically modulate metabolism and redox state has been shown to relieve carcinoma growth and the inflammatory response in autoimmune disorders. Multiple clinically applied or novel herbal chemicals with metabolic and redox modulatory capacity as well as low toxicity have recently been identified. Moreover, new metabolic targets and mechanisms of drug action have been discovered, leading to the exploration of new pathways for drug repositioning, clinical biomarker spectra, clinical treatment strategies and drug development. Taken together with multiple supporting examples, the modulation of cell metabolism and the redox capacity using herbal chemicals is emerging as a new, alternative strategy for the holistic treatment of cancer and autoimmune disorders. In the future, the development of new diagnostic tools based on the detection of metabolic and redox biomarkers, reformulation of optimized herbal compositions using artificial intelligence, and the combination of herbs with mono-targeting drugs will reveal new potential for clinical application.", "The rapid development of artificial intelligence put forward higher requirements for the computational speed, resource consumption and the biological interpretation of computational neuroscience. Spiking neuron networks can carry a large amount of information, and realize the imitation of brain information processing. However, its hardware is an important way to realize its powerful computing ability, and it is also a challenging technical problem. The memristor currently is the electronic devices that functions closest to the neuron synapse, and able to respond to spike voltage in a highly similar spike timing dependent plasticity (STDP) mechanism with a biological brain, and has become a research hotspot to construct spiking neuron networks hardware circuit in recent years. Through consulting the relevant literature at home and abroad, this paper has made a thorough understanding and introduction to the research work of the spiking neuron networks based on the memristor in recent years.\n\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\u5bf9\u8ba1\u7b97\u795e\u7ecf\u79d1\u5b66\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u901f\u5ea6\u3001\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u548c\u751f\u7269\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u8981\u6c42\u3002\u8109\u51b2\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u80fd\u591f\u643a\u5e26\u5927\u91cf\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u5927\u8111\u4fe1\u606f\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u5f0f\u7684\u6a21\u4eff\u3002\u5b83\u7684\u786c\u4ef6\u5316\u662f\u5b9e\u73b0\u5176\u5f3a\u5927\u8ba1\u7b97\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u4f46\u4e5f\u662f\u6781\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u6280\u672f\u96be\u9898\u3002\u5fc6\u963b\u5668\u662f\u76ee\u524d\u529f\u80fd\u6700\u63a5\u8fd1\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u7a81\u89e6\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u5668\u4ef6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u4ee5\u4e0e\u751f\u7269\u5927\u8111\u9ad8\u5ea6\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u8109\u51b2\u65f6\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u53ef\u5851\u6027\uff08STDP\uff09\u673a\u5236\u54cd\u5e94\u8109\u51b2\u7535\u538b\uff0c\u6210\u4e3a\u8fd1\u51e0\u5e74\u7814\u7a76\u6784\u5efa\u8109\u51b2\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u786c\u4ef6\u7535\u8def\u7684\u70ed\u70b9\u3002\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u67e5\u9605\u56fd\u5185\u5916\u76f8\u5173\u6587\u732e\uff0c\u5bf9\u8fd1\u51e0\u5e74\u57fa\u4e8e\u5fc6\u963b\u5668\u7684\u8109\u51b2\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u5de5\u4f5c\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u6df1\u5165\u4e86\u89e3\u548c\u4ecb\u7ecd\u3002.", "The present study examined individual differences in theory of mind (ToM) among a group of 60 children (7-11\u00a0years-old) with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and average intelligence. Using open-ended and structured tasks to measure affective ToM, cognitive ToM, and spontaneous social attribution, we explored the nature of ToM and assessed whether ToM predicts the phenotypic heterogeneity in ASD through structural equation modeling. Affective ToM uniquely predicted social symptom severity, whereas no ToM types predicted parent reported social functioning. Our findings suggest that differentiating among theoretical components is crucial for future ToM research in ASD, and ToM challenges related to reasoning about others' emotions may be particularly useful in distinguishing children with worse social symptoms of ASD.", "An artificial-intelligence model based on deep learning developed units in a hidden layer that resembled mammalian grid cells in the hippocampus when the agent was taught to integrate paths.

Past studies focus on younger populations, lack key comparisons to demographically matched control cohorts or explore language as a component of broader academic skills. Trends of existing studies suggest that affected children may perform at a lower level compared with typically developing peers.\nTo examine the receptive and expressive language skills of middle-school-aged children with non-syndromic cleft lip and palate (CLP) and cleft palate only (CP). Additionally, to explore the language skills of children with clefts compared with a non-cleft control group.\nThirty-seven participants with orofacial clefts (aged 7;1-14;1 years) participated in the study: 19 with CLP (10 males; 9 females) and 18 with CP (8 males; 10 females). A non-cleft comparison group consisted of 129 individuals matched on age, sex and maternal education level. Participants completed formal language (Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals, Fourth Edition) and non-verbal intellectual measurements (Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence-WASI). Demographic and developmental information was obtained via parental interview. Further clinical details (e.g., surgery; hearing status) were extracted from patient medical files. Cleft and non-cleft language and non-verbal IQ outcomes were reported separately. Language outcomes were then compared between groups.\nParticipants with clefts achieved core (mean = 103.31, standard deviation (SD) = 10.31), receptive (mean = 102.51, SD = 11.60) and expressive (mean = 102.89, SD = 12.17) language index scores within the normative average range. A total of 14.1% and 17.8% of the cleft and non-cleft groups respectively had impairment (i.e., \u2265 1.25 SD below the mean) in one or more language domains. No significant differences were found in the three language index scores between cleft and non-cleft groups.\nThis study is the first formally to examine language skills alongside non-verbal IQ in school-aged children with clefts compared with a large matched non-cleft population. Results suggest that health professionals should evaluate each child as they present and not assume that a child with non-syndromic CLP or CP will also have co-occurring language difficulties. Where language falls in the average range, these skills can be harnessed to support areas of difficulty often associated with orofacial clefting, such as speech.", "This study investigated the role of gender as a potential predictor of health behaviour and potential moderator of the relationship between emotional intelligence and health behaviour. This cross-sectional study included 1214 students (597 males and 617 females). Data were collected using the Schutte Self-Report Inventory and the Health Behaviour Checklist. Stepwise multiple regression analysis was executed with the components of health behaviour as the dependent variables to examine the predictive value of the emotional intelligence indicators as the independent variables. Gender predicted all categories of health behaviours. Only one indicator of emotional intelligence, appraisal, predicted the Accident Control and Traffic Risk Taking categories. The emotional intelligence indicator of social skills emerged only as a predictor of Wellness Maintenance and Enhancement in university students. Gender moderates the relationship between all emotional intelligence indicators and health behaviour components except the relationship between Appraisal and Substance Risk Taking and the relationship between Utilization and traffic risk taking.", "Looking inside ourselves-being present and attentive to our own and others' words and feelings-helps us communicate and interact with a mindful, open heart. Mindfulness and patient-centeredness help caregivers provide higher quality care. Historical background on a predecessor of mindfulness-the biopsychosocial model of health and disease, developed at the University of Rochester-provides context for the mindfulness \"movement\" in health care. A culture of mindfulness, supported by mindfulness and meditation training for physicians and other health care providers, helps practitioners show greater compassion, kindness, and humanity, all qualities that patients need and deserve. In the health care world, many organizations have been created that focus on aspects of mindfulness. Some have a more clinical emphasis and others focus on behavioral or neuroscience research as it relates to meditation, mindfulness, compassion, and kindness. Mindfulness is also being taught in business schools and corporations. Leaders who approach their teams with respect, integrity, honesty, and kindness are more effective leaders. Organizations like Google, Nike, and Aetna, among others, use the concept of mindfulness, as well as emotional and social intelligence, to build interpersonal competencies and create more people-centered workplaces. As medical libraries live in the health care environment and medical library leaders are key to libraries' present and future, there are strong reasons to address the concepts of mindfulness and kindness and put them to work in the medical library workplaces. A mindfulness meditation exercise closes the lecture, sending the attendees out into their day with calm and open minds and hearts.", "The 58-item MEOS assesses managing the emotions of others, a component of trait emotional intelligence (EI). Managing another person's emotions can be used with the intention of helping the target but also in a strategically manipulative manner; the subscales of the MEOS cover both these aspects of emotion management. In order to allow researchers to access shorter versions of the MEOS for use in studies where administering the full-length scale is not feasible, two short forms of the MEOS with six (MEOS-SF) and four (MEOS-VSF) items per sub-scale were developed and validated. Study 1 used factor analysis of pre-existing MEOS item data to select items for the short forms and also compared the bivariate correlations of the MEOS, MEOS-SF and MEOS-VSF with personality and global trait EI. Study 2 examined the MEOS-SF and MEOS-VSF in two new samples (N = 394/226). The results from both studies showed that the short forms had good psychometric properties and associations similar to those of the full-length MEOS with personality, global trait EI, and other measures. The MEOS-SF and MEOS-VSF are hence suitable for use in contexts where a brief assessment of the full range of the domain of managing the emotions of others is required. The availability of short subscales assessing the manipulative facets of the MEOS is especially relevant to the emerging area of \"dark side\" trait EI research.", "Through the success of deep learning in various domains, artificial neural networks are currently among the most used artificial intelligence methods. Taking inspiration from the network properties of biological neural networks (e.g. sparsity, scale-freeness), we argue that (contrary to general practice) artificial neural networks, too, should not have fully-connected layers. Here we propose sparse evolutionary training of artificial neural networks, an algorithm which evolves an initial sparse topology (Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi random graph) of two consecutive layers of neurons into a scale-free topology, during learning. Our method replaces artificial neural networks fully-connected layers with sparse ones before training, reducing quadratically the number of parameters, with no decrease in accuracy. We demonstrate our claims on restricted Boltzmann machines, multi-layer perceptrons, and convolutional neural networks for unsupervised and supervised learning on 15 datasets. Our approach has the potential to enable artificial neural networks to scale up beyond what is currently possible.", "Challenges of Digital Medicine Abstract. Digitization is increasingly covering more and more sectors, including medicine. To ensure medical operation 365 \u00d7 24 hours, progressively more human and financial resources are necessary. The transformation of patient histories from paper into electronic patient records focused initially on documentation. Today, hospital information systems are increasingly used as a platform for the communication of all professionals involved in the patient process - in Switzerland, however, so far without providing patients direct access to their data. Digititizing processes intend to increase efficiency, but also to enhance clinical and administrative decision support and quality assurance. The introduction of the electronic patient record in Switzerland in 2020 is expected to provide cross-company, more complete documentation of patient care. Multimorbid patients, often treated in different institutions and by different specialists, should benefit from this in particular. Advances in artificial intelligence offer new opportunities in medicine. Challenges include ensuring reliable data protection, and better interoperability of the systems involved. Semantically structured, machine-readable data exchange is a necessity for both networked services and internationally competitive research.\nZusammenfassung.

For example, it has been shown that a life-sized body perceived in virtual reality as substituting the participant's real body, can be felt as if it were their own, and that the body type can induce perceptual, attitudinal and behavioral changes. Here we show that changes can also occur in cognitive processing and specifically, executive functioning. Fifteen male participants were embodied in a virtual body that signifies super-intelligence (Einstein) and 15 in a (Normal) virtual body of similar age to their own. The Einstein body participants performed better on a cognitive task than the Normal body, considering prior cognitive ability (IQ), with the improvement greatest for those with low self-esteem. Einstein embodiment also reduced implicit bias against older people. Hence virtual body ownership may additionally be used to enhance executive functioning.", "The insula is involved in general and social cognition, in particular emotion regulation. Aim of this study is to investigate whether insula volume is associated with Intelligence Quotient (IQ) and emotional processing in schizophrenia patients versus healthy controls (HC).\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain scans, IQ and emotional processing tests (Benton Facial Recognition Test [BFRT], Degraded Facial Affect Recognition Task [DFAR], Emotional Mentalizing Task [EMT]) were administered in 246 subjects (133 schizophrenia patients and 113 controls). First order linear regression analyses were performed with group as independent variable and IQ/emotional processing test scores as dependent variables. Second order stepwise linear regression analyses were performed with IQ/emotional processing test scores as independent variables (as well as intracranial volumes, age, gender and cannabis abuse) and right/left insula volumes as dependent ones. A final mediation analysis (Sobel test) was performed to verify if IQ or emotional processing test scores could explain the eventual differences in insula volumes between the two groups.\nSchizophrenia patients presented lower insula volumes (left: F\u202f=\u202f9.72, p\u202f<\u202f0.01; right: F\u202f=\u202f10.93, p\u202f<\u202f0.01) as compared with healthy controls. Smaller insula volumes in schizophrenia patients are mediated by lower IQ scores (Sobel tests: 3.07, p\u202f<\u202f0.01 for right insula; 2.72, p\u202f<\u202f0.01 for left insula), but not by impairments in emotion processing.\nIQ, but not emotional processing mediates smaller insula volumes in schizophrenia patients.", "Proton Beam Therapy (PBT) was developed to minimize the harmful results of radiation therapy as treatment for brain tumors. This study examined the neurocognitive outcomes of PBT in pediatric patients. A total of 8 patients, who received either PBT or photon radiotherapy (XRT), were evaluated with multiple cognitive functions, which include intelligence, memory, executive functions, and attention. Most of patients performed average-to-superior levels of neurocognitive functions (NCF), except that a deterioration of executive functions was revealed in two patients receiving XRT. This study might be the first one to show the maintenance of multidomain NCF after PBT.", "Theory of mind is the term given by philosophers and psychologists for the ability to form a predictive model of self and others. In this paper we focus on synthetic models of theory of mind. We contend firstly that such models-especially when tested experimentally-can provide useful insights into cognition, and secondly that artificial theory of mind can provide intelligent robots with powerful new capabilities, in particular social intelligence for human-robot interaction. This paper advances the hypothesis that simulation-based internal models offer a powerful and realisable, theory-driven basis for artificial theory of mind. Proposed as a computational model of the simulation theory of mind, our simulation-based internal model equips a robot with an internal model of itself and its environment, including other dynamic actors, which can test (i.e., simulate) the robot's next possible actions and hence anticipate the likely consequences of those actions both for itself and others. Although it falls far short of a full artificial theory of mind, our model does allow us to test several interesting scenarios: in some of these a robot equipped with the internal model interacts with other robots without an internal model, but acting as proxy humans; in others two robots each with a simulation-based internal model interact with each other. We outline a series of experiments which each demonstrate some aspect of artificial theory of mind.", "Phlebolymphedema (chronic venous insufficiency-related lymphedema) is a common and costly condition. Nevertheless, there is a dearth of evidence comparing phlebolymphedema therapeutic interventions. This study sought to examine the medical resource utilization and phlebolymphedema-related cost associated with Flexitouch (FLX; Tactile Medical, Minneapolis, Minn) advanced pneumatic compression devices (APCDs) relative to conservative therapy (CONS) alone, simple pneumatic compression devices (SPCDs), and other APCDs in a representative U.S. population of phlebolymphedema patients.\nThis was a longitudinal matched case-control analysis of deidentified private insurance claims. The study used administrative claims data from Blue Health Intelligence for the complete years 2012 through 2016. Patients were continuously enrolled for at least 18\u00a0months, diagnosed with phlebolymphedema, and received at least one claim for CONS either alone or in addition to pneumatic compression (SPCDs or APCDs). The main outcomes included direct phlebolymphedema- and sequelae-related medical resource utilization and costs.\nAfter case matching, the study included 86 patients on CONS (87 on FLX), 34 on SPCDs (23 on FLX), and 69 on other APCDs (67 on FLX). Compared with CONS, FLX was associated with 69% lower per patient per year total phlebolymphedema- and sequelae-related costs net of any pneumatic compression device-related costs ($3839 vs $12,253; P\u00a0=\u00a0.001). This was driven by 59% fewer mean annual hospitalizations (0.13 vs 0.32; P\u00a0< .001) corresponding to 82% lower inpatient costs and 55% lower outpatient hospital costs. FLX was also associated with 52% lower outpatient physical therapy and occupational therapy costs and 56% lower other outpatient-related costs. Compared with SPCDs, FLX was associated with 85% lower total costs ($1153 vs $7449; P\u00a0= .008) driven by 93% lower inpatient costs ($297 vs $4215; P\u00a0=\u00a0.002), 84% lower outpatient hospital costs ($368 vs $2347; P\u00a0= .020), and 85% lower other outpatient-related costs ($353 vs $2313; P\u00a0= .023). Compared with APCDs, FLX was associated with 53% lower total costs ($3973 vs $8436; P\u00a0= .032) because of lower outpatient costs and lower rates of cellulitis (22.4% vs 44.9% of patients; P\u00a0= .02).\nThis analysis indicates significant benefits attributable to FLX compared with alternative compression therapies that can help reduce the notable economic burden of phlebolymphedema.", "According to the research mission of the librarianship and information sciences field, it is necessary to have the ability to communicate constructively between the user of the information and information in these students, and it appears more important in medical librarianship and information sciences because of the need for quick access to information for clinicians. Considering the role of spiritual intelligence in capability to establish effective and balanced communication makes it important to study this variable in librarianship and information students. One of the main factors that can affect the results of any research is conceptual model of measure variables. Accordingly, the purpose of this study was codification of spiritual intelligence measurement model.\nThis correlational study was conducted through structural equation model, and 270 students were opted from library and medical information students of nationwide medical universities by simple random sampling and responded to the King spiritual intelligence questionnaire (2008). Initially, based on the data, the model parameters were estimated using maximum likelihood method; then, spiritual intelligence measurement model was tested by fit indices. Data analysis was performed by Smart-Partial Least Squares software.\nPreliminary results showed that due to the positive indicators of predictive association and t-test results for spiritual intelligence parameters, the King measurement model has the acceptable fit and internal correlation of the questionnaire items was significant. Composite reliability and Cronbach's alpha of parameters indicated high reliability of spiritual intelligence model.\nThe spiritual intelligence measurement model was evaluated, and results showed that the model has a good fit, so it is recommended that domestic researchers use this questionnaire to assess spiritual intelligence.", "Harmful algal blooms are an annual phenomenon that cause environmental damage, economic losses, and disease outbreaks. A fundamental solution to this problem is still lacking, thus, the best option for counteracting the effects of algal blooms is to improve advance warnings (predictions). However, existing physical prediction models have difficulties setting a clear coefficient indicating the relationship between each factor when predicting algal blooms, and many variable data sources are required for the analysis. These limitations are accompanied by high time and economic costs. Meanwhile, artificial intelligence and deep learning methods have become increasingly common in scientific research; attempts to apply the long short-term memory (LSTM) model to environmental research problems are increasing because the LSTM model exhibits good performance for time-series data prediction. However, few studies have applied deep learning models or LSTM to algal bloom prediction, especially in South Korea, where algal blooms occur annually. Therefore, we employed the LSTM model for algal bloom prediction in four major rivers of South Korea. We conducted short-term (one week) predictions by employing regression analysis and deep learning techniques on a newly constructed water quality and quantity dataset drawn from 16 dammed pools on the rivers. Three deep learning models (multilayer perceptron, MLP; recurrent neural network, RNN; and long short-term memory, LSTM) were used to predict chlorophyll-a, a recognized proxy for algal activity. The results were compared to those from OLS (ordinary least square) regression analysis and actual data based on the root mean square error (RSME). The LSTM model showed the highest prediction rate for harmful algal blooms and all deep learning models out-performed the OLS regression analysis. Our results reveal the potential for predicting algal blooms using LSTM and deep learning.", "Breastmilk is natural nutrition for infants. In addition to nutrients, breast milk contains a\u00a0variety of immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial substances that help to reduce short- and long-term morbidity risks and positively influence the child's cognitive and psychomotor development. Studies show that breastfed children are at a\u00a0significantly lower risk for lower respiratory tract infections, otitis media, and gastroenteritis compared with non-breastfed children. Also, the risk for sudden infant death syndrome is significantly reduced by breastfeeding. Breastfeeding does not have an influence on the risk of allergies, neither in the overall population nor in children with a familial predisposition. However, breastfeeding promotes brain development, especially of the white matter, and is associated with improved intelligence by about 2\u00a0IQ points. Furthermore, studies show an inverse correlation between breastfeeding and the subsequent risk for obesity, and there is evidence for a\u00a0risk reduction of type\u00a02 diabetes mellitus. Breastfed infants can largely regulate their food intake. This can have a\u00a0positive effect on later eating behavior and the risk for becoming overweight. In view of the positive health effects of breastfeeding, it is recommended that infants be breast-fed exclusively during the first few months of life and that complementary feeding should be started at the earliest from the beginning of the 5th month and no later than at the beginning of the 7th month. Complementary food should be offered in a\u00a0suitable form and with consideration of the signals of the child. Overall, breastfeeding can make a\u00a0significant contribution to promoting public health and thereby to reducing healthcare costs.", "Central nervous system (CNS) involvement in hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection has different facets such as anxiety, depression, cognitive impairment and vasculitis. We were interested in detecting subclinical CNS involvement in chronic HCV infected subjects with and without systemic vasculitis.\nNineteen patients (15 females and 4 males) with chronic HCV infection (mean age 46.5\u202f\u00b1\u202f7 and mean duration since diagnosis of HCV infection 4.7\u202f\u00b1\u202f4\u202fyears, including 6 (32%) Child-Pugh class A cirrhotic patients) and 30 age, sex and education matched healthy control subjects were studied. Thirteen patients had associated vasculitis. Patients and control subjects were assessed using the block design and comprehension subtests of Wechsler Bellevue Adult Intelligence Scale, Wechsler Memory scale (WMS), Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Brain HMPAO Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) was performed for HCV patients.\nPatients with HCV had lower scores on the block design test compared to control subjects (8.37\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.89 versus 10.37\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.47, p\u202f<\u202f0.001), lower total WMS scores (43.15\u202f\u00b1\u202f10.49 versus 60.27\u202f\u00b1\u202f8.08, p\u202f<\u202f0.001) and higher anxiety and depression scores (16.94\u202f\u00b1\u202f10.46 and 37.17\u202f\u00b1\u202f10.38 versus 10.3\u202f\u00b1\u202f4.67 and 28.9\u202f\u00b1\u202f5.99, p\u202f=\u202f0.004 and 0.001, respectively). Total WMS were lower in HCV patients with vasculitis compared to those without vasculitis (39.14\u202f\u00b1\u202f9.3 versus 51.17\u202f\u00b1\u202f8.3, p\u202f=\u202f0.019) while the block design and comprehension tests, BAI and BDI were not significantly different between both groups. The block design and comprehension tests, WMS, BAI and BDI were not significantly different between cirrhotic and non-cirrhotic patients. Seven patients had different patterns of cerebral hypoperfusion on SPECT, and all of them had associated vasculitis. Abnormal SPECT was associated with lower total WMS scores (35.87\u202f\u00b1\u202f10.8 versus 46.79\u202f\u00b1\u202f8.6 in those with normal SPECT, p\u202f=\u202f0.049).\nVasculitis may contribute to the development of neuropsychiatric involvement in HCV patients.", "Interest in resistance switching is currently growing apace. The promise of novel high-density, low-power, high-speed nonvolatile memory devices is appealing enough, but beyond that there are exciting future possibilities for applications in hardware acceleration for machine learning and artificial intelligence, and for neuromorphic computing. A very wide range of material systems exhibit resistance switching, a number of which-primarily transition metal oxides-are currently being investigated as complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS)-compatible technologies. Here, the case is made for silicon oxide, perhaps the most CMOS-compatible dielectric, yet one that has had comparatively little attention as a resistance-switching material. Herein, a taxonomy of switching mechanisms in silicon oxide is presented, and the current state of the art in modeling, understanding fundamental switching mechanisms, and exciting device applications is summarized. In conclusion, silicon oxide is an excellent choice for resistance-switching technologies, offering a number of compelling advantages over competing material systems.", "Multirotor drones have been one of the most important technological advances of the last decade. Their mechanics are simple compared to other types of drones and their possibilities in flight are greater. For example, they can take-off vertically. Their capabilities have therefore brought progress to many professional activities. Moreover, advances in computing and telecommunications have also broadened the range of activities in which drones may be used. Currently, artificial intelligence and information analysis are the main areas of research in the field of computing. The case study presented in this article employed artificial intelligence techniques in the analysis of information captured by drones. More specifically, the camera installed in the drone took images which were later analyzed using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to identify the objects captured in the images. In this research, a CNN was trained to detect cattle, however the same training process could be followed to develop a CNN for the detection of any other object. This article describes the design of the platform for real-time analysis of information and its performance in the detection of cattle.", "Exposure to inorganic arsenic (As) from drinking water is associated with modest deficits in intellectual function in young children; it is unclear whether deficits occur during adolescence, when key brain functions are more fully developed.\nWe sought to determine the degree to which As exposure is associated with adolescent intelligence, and the contributory roles of lead, cadmium, manganese and selenium.\nWe recruited a cross-section of 726 14-16\u202fyear olds (mean age\u202f=\u202f14.8\u202fyears) whose mothers are participants in the Bangladesh Health Effects of Arsenic Longitudinal Study (HEALS), and whose household well water As levels, which varied widely, were well characterized. Using a culturally modified version of the WISC-IV, we examined raw Full Scale scores, and Verbal Comprehension, Perceptual Reasoning, Working Memory and Processing Speed Indices. Blood levels of As (BAs), Mn, Pb, Cd and Se were assessed at the time of the visit, as was creatinine-adjusted urinary As (UAs/Cr).\nLinear regression analyses revealed that BAs was significantly negatively associated with all WISC-IV scores except for Perceptual Reasoning. With UAs/Cr as the exposure variable, we observed significantly negative associations for all WISC-IV scores. Except for Se, blood levels of other metals, were also associated with lower WISC-IV scores. Controlling for covariates, doubling BAs, or UAs/Cr, was associated with a mean decrement (95% CI) of 3.3 (1.1, 5.5), or 3.0 (1.2, 4.5) points, respectively, in raw Full scale scores with a sample mean of 177.6 (SD\u202f=\u202f36.8). Confirmatory analyses using Bayesian Kernel Machine Regression, which identifies important mixture members, supported these findings; the primary contributor of the mixture was BAs, followed by BCd.\nOur data indicate that the adverse consequences of As exposure on neurodevelopment observed in other cross-sectional studies of younger children are also apparent during adolescence. They also implicate Cd as a neurotoxic element that deserves more attention.", "Objectives: Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is involved in numerous cognitive processes. Since cognitive deficits are a core feature of psychotic disorders, the investigation of BDNF levels in psychosis and their correlation with cognition has received increased attention. However, there are no studies investigating BDNF levels in individuals with an at-risk mental state (ARMS) for psychosis. Hence, the aims of the present study were: (1) assessing peripheral BDNF levels across different (potential) stages of psychosis; (2) investigating their association with cognition.Methods: Plasma and serum BDNF levels and neuropsychological performance were assessed in 16 ARMS, six first-episode psychosis (FEP), and 11 chronic schizophrenia (CS) patients. Neuropsychological assessment covered intelligence, verbal memory, working memory, attention and executive functioning.Results: Both plasma and serum BDNF levels were highest in CS, intermediate in FEP and lowest in ARMS. Multiple regression analysis revealed a significant positive association of plasma BDNF levels with planning ability across all groups.Conclusions: The lower peripheral BDNF levels in ARMS compared to FEP and CS might point towards an important drop of this neurotrophin prior to the onset of frank psychosis. The associations of peripheral BDNF with planning-abilities match previous findings.", "Despite the importance of vitamin D in early stages of life, data are lacking on the levels of vitamin D intake and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-(OH)D) among Chinese school-age children. The aims of this study were to investigate the vitamin D intake and serum 25-(OH)D concentration of children aged 7 to 12 years in China, and to measure the associations between vitamin D status and children's growth and development parameters. We obtained data on vitamin D intake, serum 25-(OH)D concentration, and anthropometric measurements from a cross-sectional study on school-aged children in China. Multiple linear regression and multivariable logistic regression analyses assessed the associations mentioned above. A total of 563 children (9.5 \u00b1 1.6 years) from six areas of China were included. Among them, 86.1% had a vitamin D intake below the recommended nutrient intake (10 &mu;g/day), and 54.7% had vitamin D deficiency (serum 25-(OH)D <15 ng/mL). We also found that high vitamin D intake was inversely associated with the risk of vitamin D deficiency (OR = 0.836, 95% confidence interval: 0.713, 0.980), and serum 25-(OH)D concentration was positively associated with the intelligence score and body mass index-for-age Z-score (BAZ) (p < 0.05). Insufficient vitamin D intake and serum 25-(OH)D are prevalent among Chinese school-aged children. A negative association was observed between vitamin D intake and the risk of vitamin D deficiency. Moreover, vitamin D status was positively associated with intelligence and BAZ, which await confirmation in future studies.", "How to run most effectively to catch a projectile, such as a baseball, that is flying in the air for a long period of time? The question about the best solution to the ball catching problem has been subject to intense scientific debate for almost 50 years. It turns out that this scientific debate is not focused on the ball catching problem alone, but revolves around the research question what constitutes the ingredients of intelligent decision making. Over time, two opposing views have emerged: the generalist view regarding intelligence as the ability to solve any task without knowing goal and environment in advance, based on optimal decision making using predictive models; and the specialist view which argues that intelligent decision making does not have to be based on predictive models and not even optimal, advocating simple and efficient rules of thumb (heuristics) as superior to enable accurate decisions. We study two types of approaches to the ball catching problem, one for each view, and investigate their properties using both a theoretical analysis and a broad set of simulation experiments. Our study shows that neither of the two types of approaches can be regarded as superior in solving all relevant variants of the ball catching problem: each approach is optimal under a different realistic environmental condition. Therefore, predictive models neither guarantee nor prevent success a priori, and we further show that the key difference between the generalist and the specialist approach to ball catching is the type of input representation used to control the agent. From this finding, we conclude that the right solution to a decision making or control problem is orthogonal to the generalist and specialist approach, and thus requires a reconciliation of the two views in favor of a representation-centric view.", "Somatization is a major post-traumatic symptom in sexually abused children. Thus, the present study aimed to determine the relationship between post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms and somatization, and between intelligence and somatization in child sexual abuse victims and to elucidate whether type of abuse had an effect on the relationship between PTSD symptoms and somatization.\nThis study evaluated the somatizations (Child Behavioral Checklist/6-18 [CBCL]), PTSD symptoms (Trauma Symptom Checklist for Children [TSCC]), and intelligence levels of 63 sexually abused children. Correlation and regression analyses were performed to predict somatization based on PTSD symptoms, intelligence, age, and type of sexual abuse, and to find moderating effect of type of abuse on the effect of PTSD symptom on somatization.\nPTSD symptoms (\u03b2 = 0.471, p = 0.001) and intelligence (\u03b2 = 0.327, p = 0.021) were associated with somatization. Type of abuse was not, by itself, correlated with somatization (\u03b2 = 0.158, p = 0.281), but it did have a moderating effect on the effect of PTSD symptoms on somatization (Type of abuse*PTSD symptoms, \u03b2 = -0.299, p = 0.047). PTSD symptoms were associated with somatization only among those who experienced the molestation type of abuse.\nSomatization in sexually abused children was influenced by the severity of PTSD symptoms and intelligence, and the effect of the PTSD symptoms on somatization was moderated by type of abuse. Specifically, the rape type of abuse may attenuate the effect of post-traumatic symptoms on somatization.", "First graders born prematurely perform poorly on handwriting speed and legibility. However, whether there are specific legibility factors in which preterm children demonstrate difficulty remains unknown. In addition, handwriting performance beyond the first grade and the influence of sex on handwriting performance in preterm children are still unclear. We aimed to investigate the influence of prematurity and sex on multiple dimensions of handwriting in grade two and to identify the contributors to performance.\nSixty-three preterm (34 boys and 29 girls) and 67 full-term (27 boys and 40 girls) peers in grade two were included. Class teachers were asked to complete the Chinese Handwriting Evaluation Form. A subgroup of 39 preterm children received assessments on intelligence, visual perception, tactile and kinesthetic sensation, and fine motor skills. Their inattention behavior was rated using a maternal self-report with a behavioral scale.\nBoys born prematurely exhibited poorer performance in the speed dimension than full-term boys (p = 0.008), whereas there was comparable performance in the two groups of girls (p = 0.221). In the dimensions related to legibility, preterm boys (32.4%) had a higher percentage of children with difficulty in the construction dimension than the other groups (preterm girls: 6.9%, full-term boys: 7.4%, full-term girls: 5.0%). However, no group difference was found in the dimensions of accuracy and directionality. Of the sensory-perceptual-motor factors, attention was the most significant predictor of accuracy in performance (p = 0.046) and speed dimensions (p = 0.001) in preterm children.\nBoys appear to be vulnerable to the adverse impacts of preterm birth in terms of performance in the dimensions of speed and construction in grade two. Based on the significant contribution of attention to handwriting performance in preterm children, assessment and intervention in the area of attention is strongly suggested for preterm children with handwriting problems.", "To strengthen epidemiological capacity in the country, the Government of India in 2012 initiated a unique, competency-based training in epidemiology. Modeled along the United States Epidemic Intelligence Service (EIS), this 2-year mentor-driven and practical-oriented program, based on \"learning by doing,\" is being implemented by the National Centre for Disease Control in Delhi, in close collaboration with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta. In its 4th year now, many lessons learned so far are being used to expand the program, without compromising on the technical quality. Many including the trainees who have completed the program speak highly of the epidemiological skills imparted in real time and feel that if the India EIS program is \"regionalized\" and expanded rapidly, it could in due course transform public health in the country.", "Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is among the most debilitating psychiatric disorders. Comorbid autism spectrum disorder (ASD) or autistic traits may impair treatment response in OCD. To identify possible neurostructural deficits underlying autistic traits, we performed white matter tractography on diffusion tensor images (DTI) and assessed autistic trait severity using the Autism-Spectrum Quotient (AQ) in 33 OCD patients. Correlations between AQ and the DTI parameters, fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD), and radial diffusivity (RD) were examined in major white matter tracts that were suggested to be altered in previous OCD studies. We found a negative correlation between AQ and FA and positive correlations between AQ and MD, AD and RD in the left uncinate fasciculus using age, Beck Depression Inventory, Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale, intelligence quotient and medication as covariates. However, we could not detect the significant results between AQ and all DTI parameters when adding gender as a covariate. In addition, in the ASD comorbid group, FA in the left uncinate fasciculus was significantly lower than in the non-ASD comorbid group and MD and RD were significantly higher than in the non-ASD group. These results did not survive correction for multiple comparisons. In ASD, the socio-emotional dysfunction is suggested to be related to the alteration of white matter microstructure in uncinate fasciculus. Our results suggest that variations in white matter features of the left uncinate fasciculus might be partly explained by autistic traits encountered in OCD patients.", "Memristors with tunable resistance states are emerging building blocks of artificial neural networks. However, in situ learning on a large-scale multiple-layer memristor network has yet to be demonstrated because of challenges in device property engineering and circuit integration. Here we monolithically integrate hafnium oxide-based memristors with a foundry-made transistor array into a multiple-layer neural network. We experimentally demonstrate in situ learning capability and achieve competitive classification accuracy on a standard machine learning dataset, which further confirms that the training algorithm allows the network to adapt to hardware imperfections. Our simulation using the experimental parameters suggests that a larger network would further increase the classification accuracy. The memristor neural network is a promising hardware platform for artificial intelligence with high speed-energy efficiency.", "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a group of neurodevelopmental disorders that shown a close association with impaired lipid metabolism. The acyl-carnitine spectrum status in Chinese children with ASD has not been reported. In this study, we assessed the levels of blood acyl-carnitines in Chinese children with ASD and examined the relation between acyl-carnitine profiles and the intelligence levels. Blood levels of acyl-carnitines were determined by tandem mass spectrometry in 60 children with ASD and 30 typically developing children. Chinese Wechsler Young Children Scale of Intelligence (C-WYCSI) was used in ASD group. Blood levels of free carnitine, glutaricyl carnitine, octyl carnitine, twenty four carbonyl carnitine and carnosyl carnitine in the ASD group were significantly lower than those in the control group. Glutaryl carnitine and carnosyl carnitine might be potential biomarkers for diagnosis of ASD. The changes in the acyl-carnitine spectrum indicate potential mitochondrial dysfunction and abnormal fatty acid metabolism in preschool ASD children.", "While cranial irradiation is often essential to attain a cure for pediatric brain tumors, it is associated with adverse neurocognitive outcomes, primarily manifested as declines in full-scale IQ (FSIQ). This decline results primarily from a decline in processing speed, a component of FSIQ. However, estimated IQ (EIQ) is frequently used in research and clinical settings but does not incorporate processing speed. We hypothesized that EIQ systematically underestimates neurocognitive sequelae in irradiated pediatric brain tumor survivors.\nWe treated 185 pediatric brain tumor patients with proton radiation therapy. All patients had at least 1 neuropsychological evaluation at baseline and/or 1 or more follow-up evaluations with sufficient data to calculate both FSIQ and EIQ. The Wechsler Intelligence Scales were used to calculate FSIQ and EIQ for each patient, and mixed linear models were used to assess disparities between FSIQ and EIQ.\nAt baseline, EIQ was 2.2 points (95% confidence interval 1.2-3.2 points) higher on average than FSIQ (P\u00a0<\u00a0.001). The median follow-up period was 26\u00a0months. The disparity between EIQ and FSIQ persisted and worsened over time (P\u00a0=\u00a0.012), with FSIQ losing on average 0.4 points/year (95% confidence interval 0.01-0.8 points/year) relative to EIQ. The disparity at baseline varied with sex and age.\nEIQ systematically underestimates the neurocognitive sequelae of children treated with cranial radiation therapy. FSIQ is much more likely than EIQ to identify neurocognitive deficits, allowing for appropriate interventions, as well as academic services and accommodations. Thus, EIQ should have a very limited role in both clinical and research settings for this population.", "Deficits in auditory short-term memory have been widely reported in children with Specific Language Impairment (SLI), and recent evidence suggests that children with Autism Spectrum Disorder and co-morbid language impairment (ALI) experience similar difficulties. Music, like language relies on auditory memory and the aim of the study was to extend work investigating the impact of auditory short-term memory impairments to musical perception in children with neurodevelopmental disorders. Groups of children with SLI and ALI were matched on chronological age (CA), receptive vocabulary, non-verbal intelligence and digit span, and compared with CA matched typically developing (TD) controls, on tests of pitch and temporal acuity within a voluntary musical imagery paradigm. The SLI participants performed at significantly lower levels than the ALI and TD groups on both conditions of the task and their musical imagery and digit span scores were positively correlated. In contrast ALI participants performed as well as TD controls on the tempo condition and better than TD controls on the pitch condition of the task. Whilst auditory short-term memory and receptive vocabulary impairments were similar across ALI and SLI groups, these were not associated with a deficit in voluntary musical imagery performance in the ALI group.", "The UK's Life Sciences Strategy provides UK clinical pharmacologists with a unique opportunity to enhance the impact of their discipline on patients and the NHS as well as the pharmaceutical industry. The full benefits of electronic prescribing systems, supported by artificial intelligence, will require clinical pharmacological expertise. Similarly, the Strategy's support for 'healthy ageing' will only be realized if clinical pharmacologists are able to use their expertise in promoting the safe and effective use of medicines in older people. Furthermore, their needs to be an active - and continuing - collaboration between clinical pharmacologists in the NHS and the pharmaceutical industry in general as well as with the discipline of pharmaceutical medicine.", "Self-management leads to blood glucose control and reduced morbidity and mortality in adolescents with type 1 diabetes. Different factors affect the self-management whose role and effect are still unknown. Among the influential factors whose effect is vague are spiritual intelligence, and this study aims to investigate the predictive role of spiritual intelligence in diabetes management.\nIn this descriptive-correlation study, 200 adolescents with type 1 diabetes were enrolled. To measure spiritual intelligence, the 24-question SISRI questionnaire and to measure self-management of diabetes, the SMOD-A questionnaire (48 questions) were used. Data were analyzed using SPSS software version 18 using linear regression analysis tests. Data collection was conducted by simple sampling.\nMean score of self-management of diabetes and spirituality was 86.1 \u00b1 15.1 and 60.42 \u00b1 12.9, respectively. Linear regression test (ANOVA: 0.002, F = 9.839) showed effect on diabetes self-management (\u03b2: 0.218).\nThis study showed that spiritual intelligence can predict diabetes self-management, though poorly predicted, and by strengthening it, has a decisive role in improving the health of adolescents with diabetes. Considering the findings of this study, a new window of nurses' performance in managing diabetes based on the promotion of spiritual intelligence in the educational, care, counseling, and support roles of nursing science can be opened.", "Traditional health information systems are generally devised to support clinical data collection at the point of care. However, as the significance of the modern information economy expands in scope and permeates the healthcare domain, there is an increasing urgency for healthcare organisations to offer information systems that address the expectations of clinicians, researchers and the business intelligence community alike. Amongst other emergent requirements, the principal unmet need might be defined as the 3R principle (right data, right place, right time) to address deficiencies in organisational data flow while retaining the strict information governance policies that apply within the UK National Health Service (NHS). Here, we describe our work on creating and deploying a low cost structured and unstructured information retrieval and extraction architecture within King's College Hospital, the management of governance concerns and the associated use cases and cost saving opportunities that such components present.\nTo date, our CogStack architecture has processed over 300 million lines of clinical data, making it available for internal service improvement projects at King's College London. On generated data designed to simulate real world clinical text, our de-identification algorithm achieved up to 94% precision and up to 96% recall.\nWe describe a toolkit which we feel is of huge value to the UK (and beyond) healthcare community. It is the only open source, easily deployable solution designed for the UK healthcare environment, in a landscape populated by expensive proprietary systems. Solutions such as these provide a crucial foundation for the genomic revolution in medicine.", "In patients with cortical lesions, the structure of intelligence has never been studied as a function of age at lesion onset and presence vs absence of lesional epilepsy over the life span.\nTwo thousand one hundred eighty-six cases were assembled bearing unilateral cortical lesions occurring at all ages (1301 with seizures) with postlesion verbal intelligence quotient (IQ) (VIQ) and performance IQ (PIQ).\nGlobal IQ significantly and constantly decreased as a function of age at lesion onset in the cases without epilepsy, and increased in the cases with epilepsy. Beyond the lesion onset age of 12\u202fyears, VIQ was significantly higher than PIQ in the cases without epilepsy, and lower in the cases with epilepsy. The VIQ/PIQ\u202f\u00d7\u202flesion-side interaction indicative of hemispheric specialization increased significantly linearly with age at lesion onset in the patients without epilepsy but ceased to progress at the lesion-onset age of 30\u202fyears and beyond in the cases with epilepsy.\nPostlesion global IQ, the difference between VIQ and PIQ, and the laterality index all vary significantly as a function of age at lesion onset. In addition, these changes over the life span are all quite different between cases with and without epilepsy.", "Cognitive experimental and neuroscientific research in adults indicates that an important property of face perception is its specificity and reliance on configural processing. In addition, individual differences in face perception between adults cannot be entirely explained through general cognitive functioning and object cognition. Although recent years have witnessed growing interest in the development of face perception through childhood and adolescence, as yet, little is known about individual differences in configural face perception in this period of life, and whether these differences are face-specific. Here, we addressed these questions in a large sample (N\u202f=\u202f338) drawn continuously from age six to 21. We applied a face composite task and a spatial manipulation task including stimulus inversion. Immediate and delayed face memory were assessed as covariates of configural face perception. Content specificity in configural face perception was tested by analogous tasks with houses as stimuli. In addition, we measured working memory and fluid intelligence. Our results show that there are large individual differences in configural face perception across the entire age range from six to 21\u202fyears. Supporting theories of early maturation, configural face perception was almost adult-like already at age six. Individual differences in configural face perception were related with immediate and delayed face memory and fluid intelligence across the whole age range. In sum, we provide novel evidence on large individual differences in configural face and object perception already in middle childhood, complementing findings from aging studies and providing new perspectives for further research.", "The maximization principle-that people aspire to the highest possible level of something good if all practical constraints are removed-is a common yet untested assumption about human nature. We predict that in holistic cultures-where contradiction, change, and context are emphasized-ideal states of being for the self will be more moderate than in other cultures. In two studies ( Ns = 2,392 and 6,239), we asked this question: If participants could choose their ideal level of happiness, pleasure, freedom, health, self-esteem, longevity, and intelligence, what level would they choose? Consistent with predictions, results showed that maximization was less pronounced in holistic cultures; members of holistic cultures aspired to less happiness, pleasure, freedom, health, self-esteem, longevity, and IQ than did members of other cultures. In contrast, no differences emerged on ideals for society. The studies show that the maximization principle is not a universal aspect of human nature and that there are predictable cultural differences in people's notions of perfection.", "Human intelligence has been conceptualized as a complex system of dissociable cognitive processes, yet studies investigating the neural basis of intelligence have typically emphasized the contributions of discrete brain regions or, more recently, of specific networks of functionally connected regions. Here we take a broader, systems perspective in order to investigate whether intelligence is an emergent property of synchrony within the brain's intrinsic network architecture. Using a large sample of resting-state fMRI and cognitive data (n = 830), we report that the synchrony of functional interactions within and across distributed brain networks reliably predicts fluid and flexible intellectual functioning. By adopting a whole-brain, systems-level approach, we were able to reliably predict individual differences in human intelligence by characterizing features of the brain's intrinsic network architecture. These findings hold promise for the eventual development of neural markers to predict changes in intellectual function that are associated with neurodevelopment, normal aging, and brain disease.", "The aim of this study is to investigate glucose uptake on 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) in patients with chronic mental and cognitive symptoms following a single blunt mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) and without visible brain lesions on computed tomography (CT)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Eighty-nine consecutive patients (mean age 43.8\u2009\u00b1\u200910.75 years) who had a single blunt mild TBI from a traffic accident and suffering from chronic mental and cognitive symptoms without visible brain lesions on CT/MRI were enrolled in the study. Patients underwent FDG-PET imaging, and the mean interval between the TBI and FDG-PET was 50.0 months. The Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale version III (WAIS-III) testing was performed within 1 month of the FDG-PET. A control group consisting of 93 healthy adult volunteers (mean age 42.2\u2009\u00b1\u200914.3 years) also underwent FDG-PET. The glucose uptake pattern from FDG-PET in the patient group was compared with that from normal controls using statistical parametric mapping. Glucose uptake was significantly decreased in the bilateral prefrontal area and significantly increased around the limbic system in the patient group compared with normal controls. This topographical pattern of glucose uptake is different from that reported previously in patients with diffuse axonal injury (DAI), but may be similar to that seen in patients with major depression disorder. These results suggest that the pathological mechanism causing chronic mental and cognitive symptoms in patients with a single blunt mild TBI and without visible brain lesions might be different from that due to primary axonopathy in patients with DAI.", "The current study intended to model the link between implicit theories of intelligence (ITI) and students' academic achievement, within a meta-analytic review procedure. To assess studies' effect size, the Pearson's correlation coefficient (r) was used. The review of 46 studies (94 effect sizes) with 412,022 students presented a low-to-moderate association between the ITI and students' academic achievement. The results indicated that incremental theorists are more likely to have higher grades in specific subjects (verbal and quantitative) and in overall achievement. The entity beliefs were positively associated with students' specific verbal and quantitative domains but at a lower magnitude than incremental beliefs. Moreover, the moderator effect analyses results indicated that the link between ITI and students' achievement was not moderated by gender, but there was a moderate association in student's middle school grade. Additionally, the ITI assessment based on the most recent versions of Dweck's scales, the use of specific academic scales instead of general ITI scales, and the use of the original measures rather than adapted versions strongly moderated the link between ITI and achievement. Moreover, students from Eastern continents (Asia and Oceania) reported a positive association between incremental beliefs and achievement, Europe displayed a positive link between entity beliefs and achievement, whereas North America presented negative correlations between entity perspectives and academic achievement. This meta-analysis updates the current evidence supporting the direct link of ITI and students' academic achievement and acknowledges specific effects that ITI could have in different academic outcomes.", "To explore how much people with Asperger's syndrome know and understand about early attachment behaviors and whether this knowledge can be increased through a DVD.\nAdults with Asperger's syndrome who were not parents (N = 28) took part in four experimental conditions: Baseline, pre-intervention, post-intervention, and follow-up. Participants watched a DVD and received a booklet summarizing its contents. Participants were asked seven questions about attachment in all four conditions. Measures of trait emotional intelligence, IQ and autistic symptomatology were explored as possible predicting factors.\nA significant increase in knowledge of early attachment behaviors was observed at post-intervention for the total knowledge score and four out of the seven attachment questions. This was maintained at follow-up. Trait emotional intelligence, IQ and autistic symptomology did not predict pre-intervention or increase in knowledge.\nKnowledge and understanding of early attachment behaviors can be improved through the use of a DVD.", "Epilepsy is frequently associated with neurocognitive impairments, mental health, and psychosocial problems but these are rarely documented in low- and middle-income countries. The aim of this study was to examine the neurocognitive outcomes, depressive symptoms, and psychosocial adjustments of people with epilepsy (PWE) in Kilifi, Kenya. We evaluated the impact of these outcomes on health-related quality of life. Self-report, interviewer-administered measures of depression (Major Depression Inventory) and quality of life (RAND SF-36) were administered to 63 PWE and 83 community controls. Neurocognitive functioning was assessed using Raven's Standard Progressive Matrices, Digit Span, and Contingency Naming Test. The results show that PWE have poorer scores for executive function, working memory, intelligence quotient (IQ), depression, and quality of life than controls. Twenty-seven (27%) of PWE had depressive symptoms, which was significantly greater than in controls (6%); P\u202f<\u202f0.001. Quality-of-life scores were significantly lower in PWE with depressive symptoms than in those without depressive symptoms (Mean QoL scores (standard deviation (SD)): 46.43 (13.27) versus 64.18 (17.69); P\u202f=\u202f0.01. On adjusted linear regression models, depression affected total quality-of-life scores (P\u202f=\u202f0.07) as well as individual health indicator domains touching on pain (P\u202f=\u202f0.04), lethargy/fatigue (P\u202f=\u202f0.01), and emotional well-being (P\u202f=\u202f0.02). Our results show that epilepsy is associated with a significant burden of mental health and neurocognitive impairments in the community; however, community-based studies are needed to provide precise estimates of these disorders.", "Artificial intelligence and machine learning are poised to influence nearly every aspect of the human condition, and cardiology is not an exception to this trend. This paper provides a guide for clinicians on relevant aspects of artificial intelligence and machine learning, reviews selected applications of these methods in cardiology to date, and identifies how cardiovascular medicine could incorporate artificial intelligence in the future. In particular, the paper first reviews predictive modeling concepts relevant to cardiology such as feature selection and frequent pitfalls such as improper dichotomization. Second, it discusses common algorithms used in supervised learning and reviews selected applications in cardiology and related disciplines. Third, it describes the advent of deep learning and related methods collectively called unsupervised learning, provides contextual examples both in general medicine and in cardiovascular medicine, and\u00a0then explains how these methods could be applied to enable precision cardiology and improve patient outcomes.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) is emerging as a technology with the power to transform established industries, and with applications from automated manufacturing to advertising and facial recognition to fully autonomous transportation. Advances in each of these domains have led some to call AI the \"fourth\" industrial revolution [1]. In healthcare, AI is emerging as both a productive and disruptive force across many disciplines. This is perhaps most evident in Diagnostic Radiology and Pathology, specialties largely built around the processing and complex interpretation of medical images, where the role of AI is increasingly seen as both a boon and a threat. In Radiation Oncology as well, AI seems poised to reshape the specialty in significant ways, though the impact of AI has been relatively limited at present, and may rightly seem more distant to many, given the predominantly interpersonal and complex interventional nature of the specialty. In this overview, we will explore the current state and anticipated future impact of AI on Radiation Oncology, in detail, focusing on key topics from multiple stakeholder perspectives, as well as the role our specialty may play in helping to shape the future of AI within the larger spectrum of medicine.", "Evolution sculpts both the body plans and nervous systems of agents together over time. By contrast, in artificial intelligence and robotics, a robot's body plan is usually designed by hand, and control policies are then optimized for that fixed design. The task of simultaneously co-optimizing the morphology and controller of an embodied robot has remained a challenge. In psychology, the theory of embodied cognition posits that behaviour arises from a close coupling between body plan and sensorimotor control, which suggests why co-optimizing these two subsystems is so difficult: most evolutionary changes to morphology tend to adversely impact sensorimotor control, leading to an overall decrease in behavioural performance. Here, we further examine this hypothesis and demonstrate a technique for 'morphological innovation protection', which temporarily reduces selection pressure on recently morphologically changed individuals, thus enabling evolution some time to 'readapt' to the new morphology with subsequent control policy mutations. We show the potential for this method to avoid local optima and converge to similar highly fit morphologies across widely varying initial conditions, while sustaining fitness improvements further into optimization. While this technique is admittedly only the first of many steps that must be taken to achieve scalable optimization of embodied machines, we hope that theoretical insight into the cause of evolutionary stagnation in current methods will help to enable the automation of robot design and behavioural training-while simultaneously providing a test bed to investigate the theory of embodied cognition.", "Evoking strength is one of the important contributions of the field of Biomedical Informatics to the discipline of Artificial Intelligence. The University at Buffalo's Orthopedics Department wanted to create an expert system to assist patients with self-diagnosis of knee problems and to thereby facilitate referral to the right orthopedic subspecialist. They had two independent sports medicine physicians review 469 cases. A board-certified orthopedic sports medicine practitioner, L.B., reviewed any disagreements until a gold standard diagnosis was reached. For each case, the patients entered 126 potential answers to 26 questions into a Web interface. These were modeled by an expert sports medicine physician and the answers were reviewed by L.B. For each finding, the clinician specified the sensitivity (term frequency) and both specificity (Sp) and the heuristic evoking strength (ES). Heuristics are methods of reasoning with only partial evidence. An expert system was constructed that reflected the posttest odds of disease-ranked list for each case. We compare the accuracy of using Sp to that of using ES (original model, p\u2009<\u20090.0008; term importance * disease importance [DItimesTI] model, p\u2009<\u20090.0001: Wilcoxon ranked sum test). For patient referral assignment, Sp in the DItimesTI model was superior to the use of ES. By the fifth diagnosis, the advantage was lost and so there is no difference between the techniques when serving as a reminder system.", "The aim of the present study was to examine the relation between understanding of emotions and cardiovascular related diseases, namely coronary heart disease, diabetes mellitus and obesity. The uniqueness of this study lies in the fact that it examined the relationship between the cardiovascular related diseases named above and the understanding of emotions in the context of Emotional Intelligence (EI).\nThe study was conducted in 300 participants during a 3 year period. All participants completed a self-report questionnaire, assessing various aspects of EI, such as self-emotion appraisal, other emotion appraisal, emotion regulation and use of emotions. As hypothesized, coronary heart disease is a prognostic factor of regulation of emotions.\nThe present study is an attempt to examine the relation between emotional understanding and cardiovascular related diseases, namely coronary heart disease, diabetes mellitus and obesity. Establishing which diseases are independent risk factors for the understanding of emotions, could have a significant impact on emotional health, through the treatment of these cardiovascular related diseases. Emotions were studied within the theoretical context of Emotional Intelligence (EI), which affects people's physical and mental health.\nThe results of this study emphasize on the relationship of cardiovascular related diseases and psychological characteristics, such as anxiety and anger, being aspects of EI. Additionally, this work fills a gap in the relevant Greek literature, as a first attempt to examine the correlation of EI with cardiovascular related diseases.", "A major ambition of artificial intelligence lies in translating patient data to successful therapies. Machine learning models face particular challenges in biomedicine, however, including handling of extreme data heterogeneity and lack of mechanistic insight into predictions. Here, we argue for \"visible\" approaches that guide model structure with experimental biology.", "In numerate societies, early arithmetic development is associated with visuospatial working memory, executive functions, nonverbal intelligence, and magnitude-comparison abilities. To what extent do these associations arise from cultural practices or general cognitive prerequisites? Here, we administered tests of these cognitive abilities (Corsi Blocks, Raven's Colored Progressive Matrices, Porteus Maze) to indigenous children in remote northern Australia, whose culture contains few counting words or counting practices, and to nonindigenous children from an Australian city. The indigenous children completed a standard nonverbal addition task; the nonindigenous children completed a comparable single-digit addition task. The correlation matrices among variables in the indigenous and nonindigenous children showed similar patterns of relationships, and parallel regression analyses showed that visuospatial working memory was the main predictor of addition performance in both groups. Our findings support the hypothesis that the same cognitive capacities promote competence for learners in both numerate and nonnumerate societies.", "Early socioeconomic status (SES) correlates with later-life cognition. However, the effect of socioeconomic context (SEC), which reflects influences from broader ecological contexts, has not been examined. The present study developed a measure of SEC using lifetime residential addresses and examined SEC and residential mobility effects on later-life cognition.\nOlder adults (N = 117, Mage = 75) reported addresses since birth. Latent SEC was constructed from census income, employment, and education (1920-2010) for each county and census year, extrapolated between census years. Controlling for current SES, SEC in childhood (ages 0-18) and adulthood (ages 19-60), with finer granulations in young adulthood (ages 19-39) and midlife (ages 40-60), predicted later-life cognition. Effects of residential mobility on later-life cognition were also examined.\nHigher childhood and adulthood SEC were associated with better Auditory Verbal Learning Test recognition (\u03b2 = .24, p = .012) and immediate recall (\u03b2 = .26, p = .008). Higher midlife SEC was associated with faster task switching (\u03b2 = .26, p = .025) and better task switching efficiency (\u03b2 = .27, p = .022). Higher residential mobility in childhood was associated with higher crystallized intelligence (\u03b2 = .194, p = .040).\nIndependent of current SES, childhood and adulthood SEC predicted later-life cognition, which may be sensitive to effects of social institutions and environmental health. SEC assessed across the lifespan, and related residential mobility information may be important complements to SES in predicting later-life cognitive health.", "Robots autonomously interact with their environment through a continual sense-decide-respond control loop. Most commonly, the decide step occurs in a central processing unit; however, the stiffness mismatch between rigid electronics and the compliant bodies of soft robots can impede integration of these systems. We develop a framework for programmable mechanical computation embedded into the structure of soft robots that can augment conventional digital electronic control schemes. Using an origami waterbomb as an experimental platform, we demonstrate a 1-bit mechanical storage device that writes, erases, and rewrites itself in response to a time-varying environmental signal. Further, we show that mechanical coupling between connected origami units can be used to program the behavior of a mechanical bit, produce logic gates such as AND, OR, and three input majority gates, and transmit signals between mechanologic gates. Embedded mechanologic provides a route to add autonomy and intelligence in soft robots and machines.", "(1) Examine performance on an objective measure of reward-related cognitive impulsivity (delay discounting) among self-reported habitual short sleepers and medium (i.e. recommended 7-9 hours) length sleepers either reporting or not reporting daytime dysfunction; (2) Inform the debate regarding what type and duration of short sleep (e.g. 21 to 24 hours of total sleep deprivation, self-reported habitual short sleep duration) meaningfully influences cognitive impulsivity; (3) Compare the predictive utility of sleep duration and perceived dysfunction to other factors previously shown to influence cognitive impulsivity via delay discounting performance (age, income, education, and fluid intelligence).\nWe analyzed data from 1190 adults from the Human Connectome Project database. Participants were grouped on whether they reported habitual short (\u22646 hours) vs. medium length (7-9 hours) sleep duration and whether they perceived daytime dysfunction using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index.\nAll short sleepers exhibited increased delay discounting compared to all medium length sleepers, regardless of perceived dysfunction. Of the variables examined, self-reported sleep duration was the strongest predictor of delay discounting behavior between groups and across all 1190 participants.\nIndividuals who report habitual short sleep are likely to exhibit increased reward-related cognitive impulsivity regardless of perceived sleep-related daytime impairment. Therefore, there is a reason to suspect that these individuals exhibit more daytime dysfunction, in the form of reward-related cognitive impulsivity, than they may assume. Current findings suggest that assessment of sleep duration over the prior month has meaningful predictive utility for human reward-related impulsivity.", "Artifical Intelligence (AI) was reviewed with a focus on its potential applicability to radiation oncology. The improvement of process efficiencies and the prevention of errors were found to be the most significant contributions of AI\u00a0to radiation oncology. It was found that the prevention of errors is most effective when data transfer processes were automated and operational decisions were based on logical or learned evaluations by the system. It was concluded that AI\u00a0could greatly improve the efficiency and accuracy of radiation oncology operations.", "Emotional Intelligence (EI) can be defined as an \"ability to monitor one's own and others' feelings and emotions, to discriminate among them and to use this information to guide one's thinking and actions\" (Salovey and Mayer, 1990) [1]. As such EI plays a major role in sport sciences. Studies conducted so far have shown contrasting findings. The paper contains data concerning the psychometric properties of the \"Profile of Emotional Competence\" questionnaire administered to a sample of 479 subjects (239 athletes, 240 non-athletes, age ranging from 12 to 18 years old, 239 men, and 240 women) in order: i) to explore EI between athletes and non-athletes students and ii) to examine differences in EI of young participants in terms of gender and age.", "Emotion dysregulation and impulsivity are important factors influencing the development and course of alcohol dependence. However, few empirical studies investigate the association between different aspects of impulsivity (cognitive, attentional, behavioral), emotion regulation, and alcohol use disorder symptoms in the same model. The goal of this study was to assess the association between emotion regulation and different facets of impulsivity among patients with an alcohol use disorder and healthy controls. The sample was comprised of 273 individuals: 180 participants with an alcohol use disorder undergoing inpatient alcohol treatment and 93 healthy controls. Emotion regulation was assessed using the Schutte Self-Report Emotional Intelligence Test subscale. Impulsivity was assessed with Barratt's Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11). Statistical models tested both the BIS-11 total score, as well as three secondary factors (non-planning, attentional, and motor impulsivity). Findings indicate that individuals with alcohol use disorder symptoms were characterized by poor emotion regulation and high levels of impulsivity in all analyzed domains. Moreover, path analytic models indicated that after accounting for demographic factors (i.e., biological sex, age, education) there was evidence for a significant indirect effect of alcohol use disorder symptomatology on non-planning and attentional impulsivity via emotion regulation. There was no association between emotion regulation and motor impulsivity. These findings indicate the importance of targeting emotion regulation skills as well as behavioral control when treating patients with alcohol use disorder.", "Total hippocampal volume has previously been shown to correlate with performance on tests for verbal episodic memory. However, there are sparse evidence on how hippocampal subfield volumes are related to verbal episodic memory in healthy adults. The present study investigated the association between volumes of separate hippocampal subfields and verbal episodic memory performance in healthy volunteers. Forty-seven participants (31 females) between 20-71 years age underwent testing with the California Verbal Learning Test II (CVLT II), and the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI) to obtain an estimate of cognitive functioning. T1-weighted MR images were obtained after cognitive testing, and volumetric estimates adjusted for age and estimated total intracranial volume were calculated in the FreeSurfer 6.0 software suite for cerebral -and hippocampal structures. The sample performed within the statistical normal range on both CVLT II and WASI. Significant correlations adjusted for multiple testing were found between CVLT II subtests of total learning, free immediate recall and free delayed recall and volumes of the left Cornu Ammonis (CA) 1-4 subfields. There were no significant correlations between right hippocampal subfields and CVLT II performance, and no significant correlation between WASI results and hippocampal subfields. The present results suggest that better verbal episodic memory measured by the CVLT II is associated with relative larger volumes of specific left CA hippocampal subfields in healthy adults. Due to the small sample size and large age-span of the participants, the present findings are preliminary and should be confirmed in larger samples.", "To investigate the cognitive profile of healthy individuals with increased Cardiovascular Risk Factors, Aging and Dementia (CAIDE) dementia risk score and to explore whether this association is related to vascular burden and CSF biomarkers of amyloidosis and neurodegeneration.\nCognitively normal participants (mean age 57.6 years) from the Gipuzkoa Alzheimer Project study were classified as having high risk (HR; n = 82) or low risk (LR; n = 293) for dementia according to a CAIDE score cutoff of 9. Cognitive composites were compared between groups. We explored using generalized linear models the role of APOE genotype, MRI white matter hyperintensities (WMH), and CSF (n = 218) levels of \u03b2-amyloid1-42 (A\u03b21-42), total tau (t-tau), and phosphorylated tau (p-tau) in the association between CAIDE score and cognition.\nHR participants obtained lower scores on executive function (EF) (p = 0.001) and visual perception and construction (VPC) (p < 0.001) composites. EF composite was associated with CAIDE score \u00d7 p-tau (p = 0.001), CAIDE score \u00d7 t-tau (p = 0.001), and WMH (p = 0.003). VPC composite was associated with APOE (p = 0.001), A\u03b21-42 (p = 0.004), the interaction APOE \u00d7 A\u03b21-42 (p = 0.003), and WMH (p = 0.004). Performance on global memory was associated with A\u03b21-42 (p = 0.006), APOE (p = 0.008), and their interaction (p = 0.006). Analyses were adjusted for age, education, sex, premorbid intelligence, and stress.\nHealthy participants at increased dementia risk based on CAIDE scores show lower performance in EF and VPC. This difference is related to APOE, WMH, and Alzheimer biomarkers.", "Predictions about the future of laboratory medicine have had a mixed success, and in some instances they have been overambitious and incorrectly assessed the future impact of emerging technologies. Current predictions suggest a more highly automated and connected future for diagnostic testing. The central laboratory of the future may be dominated by more robotics and more connectivity in order to take advantage of the benefits of the Internet of Things and artificial intelligence (AI)-based systems (e.g. decision support software and imaging analytics). For point-of-care testing, mobile health (mHealth) may be in the ascendancy driven by healthcare initiatives from technology companies such as Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, IBM, Microsoft and Uber.", "Previous studies have shown that high socioeconomic status (SES) is significantly associated with inhibitory control, working memory, verbal comprehension and IQ. However, in the Asian setting, with its prevailing poverty, information about the influence of SES on cognitive development of female adolescents is limited. This study was aimed to investigate the association between SES and neurocognitive performance of early female adolescents in Sri Lanka.\nFemale adolescents aged 11-14 years (n = 200) of low and middle SES were studied to assess neurocognitive function. After obtaining baseline data, eight subtests of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC - IV), Test Of Nonverbal Intelligence (TONI-3) and two computer-based executive function tests (inhibition and visuo-spatial working memory) were administered to assess neurocognitive measures of the above adolescents. The results were compiled into a data base and analyzed using SPSS version 20 statistical software.\nHigher SES was associated with higher performance in all neurocognitive tests. Low SES adolescents obtained significantly poor test scores for executive function test (inhibitory control: p < 0.0001) and for WISC [verbal comprehension index (VCI): p < 0.0001), working memory index (WMI): p < 0.0001 and estimated full scale IQ (EFSIQ): p < 0.0001)] when compared with middle SES adolescents. Maternal education alone significantly predicts VCI and EFSIQ than the combined influence of parental education, occupation and income. Psychosocial adversities of adolescents were inversely correlated with VCI (r = -0.30; p < 0.001) and EFSIQ (r = -0.20; p < 0.001) of WISC and mathematics performance (r = -0.34; p < 0.001) at examination in school.\nFindings of the study revealed the importance of upliftment of SES of the society to improve the cognitive and academic outcomes of low SES individuals.", "Non-heme iron is a vital metabolic cofactor for many core processes of brain development including myelination, dendritogenesis, and neurotransmitter synthesis, and accumulates in the brain with age. However, little is known about development-related differences in brain iron and its association with emerging cognitive abilities during formative years. In this study, we estimated brain iron via R2* relaxometry in children ages 7-16 (N\u202f=\u202f57; 38 females) and examined its relation to age-related differences in cognitive ability. As we hypothesized, age correlated positively with iron content in the hippocampus and across subregions of the basal ganglia. The magnitude of age differences in iron content differed between regions such that the largest effects were observed in basal ganglia subregions: globus pallidus, substantia nigra, caudate nucleus, and putamen, as compared to values obtained for the hippocampus and red nucleus. We did not observe sex or hemispheric differences in iron content. Notably, greater brain iron content was associated with both faster processing speed and higher general intelligence, and shared 21.4% of the age-related improvement in processing speed and 12.5% of the improvement in general intelligence. These results suggest that non-heme iron plays a central neurobiological role in the development of critical cognitive abilities during childhood.", "Human genetic research has implicated functional variants of more than one hundred genes in the modulation of persisting pain. Artificial intelligence and machine-learning techniques may combine this knowledge with results of genetic research gathered in any context, which permits the identification of the key biological processes involved in chronic sensitization to pain.\nBased on published evidence, a set of 110 genes carrying variants reported to be associated with modulation of the clinical phenotype of persisting pain in eight different clinical settings was submitted to unsupervised machine-learning aimed at functional clustering. Subsequently, a mathematically supported subset of genes, comprising those most consistently involved in persisting pain, was analysed by means of computational functional genomics in the Gene Ontology knowledgebase.\nClustering of genes with evidence for a modulation of persisting pain elucidated a functionally heterogeneous set. The situation cleared when the focus was narrowed to a genetic modulation consistently observed throughout several clinical settings. On this basis, two groups of biological processes, the immune system and nitric oxide signalling, emerged as major players in sensitization to persisting pain, which is biologically highly plausible and in agreement with other lines of pain research.\nThe present computational functional genomics-based approach provided a computational systems-biology perspective on chronic sensitization to pain. Human genetic control of persisting pain points to the immune system as a source of potential future targets for drugs directed against persisting pain. Contemporary machine-learned methods provide innovative approaches to knowledge discovery from previous evidence.\nWe show that knowledge discovery in genetic databases and contemporary machine-learned techniques can identify relevant biological processes involved in Persitent pain.", "The chemical signatures of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in humans can be utilized for point-of-care (POC) diagnosis. Apart from toxic exposure studies, VOCs generated in humans can provide insights into one's healthy and diseased metabolic states, acting as a biomarker for identifying numerous diseases noninvasively. VOC sensors and the technology of e-nose have received significant attention for continuous and selective monitoring of various physiological and pathophysiological conditions of an individual. Noninvasive detection of VOCs is achieved from biomatrices of breath, sweat and saliva. Among these, detection from sweat and saliva can be continuous in real-time. The sensing approaches include optical, chemiresistive and electrochemical techniques. This article provides an overview of such techniques. These, however, have limitations of reliability, precision, selectivity, and stability in continuous monitoring. Such limitations are due to lack of sensor stability and complexity of samples in a multivariate environment, which can lead to false readings. To overcome selectivity barriers, sensor arrays enabling multimodal sensing, have been used with pattern recognition techniques. Stability and precision issues have been addressed through advancements in nanotechnology. The use of various forms of nanomaterial not only enhance sensing performance, but also plays a major role in detection on a miniaturized scale. The rapid growth in medical Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence paves a pathway for improvements in human theranostics.", "Statistical learning (SL) is a method of learning based on the transitional probabilities embedded in sequential phenomena such as music and language. It has been considered an implicit and domain-general mechanism that is innate in the human brain and that functions independently of intention to learn and awareness of what has been learned. SL is an interdisciplinary notion that incorporates information technology, artificial intelligence, musicology, and linguistics, as well as psychology and neuroscience. A body of recent study has suggested that SL can be reflected in neurophysiological responses based on the framework of information theory. This paper reviews a range of work on SL in adults and children that suggests overlapping and independent neural correlations in music and language, and that indicates disability of SL. Furthermore, this article discusses the relationships between the order of transitional probabilities (TPs) (i.e., hierarchy of local statistics) and entropy (i.e., global statistics) regarding SL strategies in human's brains; claims importance of information-theoretical approaches to understand domain-general, higher-order, and global SL covering both real-world music and language; and proposes promising approaches for the application of therapy and pedagogy from various perspectives of psychology, neuroscience, computational studies, musicology, and linguistics.", "School performance is one of the most stable and heritable psychological characteristics. Notwithstanding, monozygotic twins (MZ), who have identical genotypes, differ in school performance. These MZ differences result from non-shared environments that do not contribute to the similarity within twin pairs. Because to date few non-shared environmental factors have been reliably associated with MZ differences in school performance, they are thought to be idiosyncratic and due to chance, suggesting that the effect of non-shared environments on MZ differences are age- and trait-specific. In a sample of 2768 MZ twin pairs, we found first that MZ differences in school performance were moderately stable from age 12 through 16, with differences at the ages 12 and 14 accounting for 20% of the variance in MZ differences at age 16. Second, MZ differences in school performance correlated positively with MZ differences across 16 learning-related variables, including measures of intelligence, personality and school attitudes, with the twin who scored higher on one also scoring higher on the other measures. Finally, MZ differences in the 16 learning-related variables accounted for 22% of the variance in MZ differences in school performance at age 16. These findings suggest that, unlike for other psychological domains, non-shared environmental factors affect school performance in systematic ways that have long-term and generalist influence. Our findings should motivate the search for non-shared environmental factors responsible for the stable and systematic effects on children's differences in school performance.

Specifically, we review previous work on the influence of intelligence, gender, age, personality, mental illnesses/medical conditions, dieting, craving, stress/anxiety, emotion/motivation, stereotype threat, temperature, mindfulness training, practice, bilingualism, musical training, altitude/hypoxia, sleep, exercise, diet, psychoactive substances, and brain stimulation on WM performance. In addition to a review of the literature, we suggest several frameworks for classifying these factors, identify shared mechanisms between several variables, and suggest areas requiring further investigation. This review critically examines the breadth of research investigating WM while synthesizing the results across related subfields in psychology.", "Heart Rate Variability (HRV) is an important tool for the analysis of a patient&rsquo;s physiological conditions, as well a method aiding the diagnosis of cardiopathies. Photoplethysmography (PPG) is an optical technique applied in the monitoring of the HRV and its adoption has been growing significantly, compared to the most commonly used method in medicine, Electrocardiography (ECG). In this survey, definitions of these technique are presented, the different types of sensors used are explained, and the methods for the study and analysis of the PPG signal (linear and nonlinear methods) are described. Moreover, the progress, and the clinical and practical applicability of the PPG technique in the diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases are evaluated. In addition, the latest technologies utilized in the development of new tools for medical diagnosis are presented, such as Internet of Things, Internet of Health Things, genetic algorithms, artificial intelligence and biosensors which result in personalized advances in e-health and health care. After the study of these technologies, it can be noted that PPG associated with them is an important tool for the diagnosis of some diseases, due to its simplicity, its cost\u207bbenefit ratio, the easiness of signals acquisition, and especially because it is a non-invasive technique.", "The evidence-based literature on healthcare is currently expanding exponentially. The opportunities provided by the advancement in artificial intelligence (AI) tools such as machine learning are appealing in tackling many of the current healthcare challenges. Thus, AI integration is expanding in most fields of healthcare, including the field of hematology. This study aims to review the current applications of AI in the field of hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). A literature search was done involving the following databases: Ovid MEDLINE, including In-Process and other non-indexed citations, and Google Scholar. The abstracts of the following professional societies were also screened: American Society of Hematology, American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation, and European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation. The literature review showed that the integration of AI in the field of HCT has grown remarkably in the last decade and offers promising avenues in diagnosis and prognosis in HCT populations targeting both pre- and post-transplant challenges. Studies of AI integration in HCT have many limitations that include poorly tested algorithms, lack of generalizability, and limited use of different AI tools. Machine learning techniques in HCT are an intense area of research that needs much development and extensive support from hematology and HCT societies and organizations globally as we believe that this will be the future practice paradigm.\nSa\u011fl\u0131k hizmetine y\u00f6nelik kan\u0131ta dayal\u0131 literat\u00fcr g\u00fcn\u00fcm\u00fczde katlanarak artmaktad\u0131r.

Nevertheless, little attention has been given to how attachment dynamics influence relationships at work or the extent to which adult attachment patterns are mirrored in leaders' perceptions and behaviors toward their direct reports. Moreover, attachment measures that use romantic relationships as their referent might not be appropriate for use in organizational settings with executive clients. Thus, a measure that directly references direct reports and that could be put to use in organizational contexts is needed. The two studies reported here supported the two-factor orthogonal structure of such a measure and results from a sample of Fortune 500 executives reveal that leader attachment relates in theoretically consistent ways with general adult attachment, the Big Five, emotional intelligence, and critical thinking. Results are discussed in terms of integrating attachment measures into organizational personality assessment to inform work with organizational clients.", "Mobile health (m-Health) has been repeatedly called the biggest technological breakthrough of our modern times. Similarly, the concept of big data in the context of healthcare is considered one of the transformative drivers for intelligent healthcare delivery systems. In recent years, big data has become increasingly synonymous with mobile health, however key challenges of 'Big Data and mobile health', remain largely untackled. This is becoming particularly important with the continued deluge of the structured and unstructured data sets generated on daily basis from the proliferation of mobile health applications within different healthcare systems and products globally. The aim of this paper is of twofold. First we present the relevant big data issues from the mobile health (m-Health) perspective. In particular we discuss these issues from the technological areas and building blocks (communications, sensors and computing) of mobile health and the newly defined (m-Health 2.0) concept. The second objective is to present the relevant rapprochement issues of big m-Health data analytics with m-Health. Further, we also present the current and future roles of machine and deep learning within the current smart phone centric m-health model. The critical balance between these two important areas will depend on how different stakeholder from patients, clinicians, healthcare providers, medical and m-health market businesses and regulators will perceive these developments. These new perspectives are essential for better understanding the fine balance between the new insights of how intelligent and connected the future mobile health systems will look like and the inherent risks and clinical complexities associated with the big data sets and analytical tools used in these systems. These topics will be subject for extensive work and investigations in the foreseeable future for the areas of data analytics, computational and artificial intelligence methods applied for mobile health.", "Wearables as medical technologies are becoming an integral part of personal analytics, measuring physical status, recording physiological parameters, or informing schedule for medication. These continuously evolving technology platforms do not only promise to help people pursue a healthier life style, but also provide continuous medical data for actively tracking metabolic status, diagnosis, and treatment. Advances in the miniaturization of flexible electronics, electrochemical biosensors, microfluidics, and artificial intelligence algorithms have led to wearable devices that can generate real-time medical data within the Internet of things. These flexible devices can be configured to make conformal contact with epidermal, ocular, intracochlear, and dental interfaces to collect biochemical or electrophysiological signals. This article discusses consumer trends in wearable electronics, commercial and emerging devices, and fabrication methods. It also reviews real-time monitoring of vital signs using biosensors, stimuli-responsive materials for drug delivery, and closed-loop theranostic systems. It covers future challenges in augmented, virtual, and mixed reality, communication modes, energy management, displays, conformity, and data safety. The development of patient-oriented wearable technologies and their incorporation in randomized clinical trials will facilitate the design of safe and effective approaches.", "The study investigated cross-cultural differences in variability and average performance in arithmetic, mathematical reasoning, symbolic and non-symbolic magnitude processing, intelligence, spatial ability, and mathematical anxiety in 890 6- to 9-year-old children from the United Kingdom, Russia, and China. Cross-cultural differences explained 28% of the variance in arithmetic and 17.3% of the variance in mathematical reasoning, with Chinese children outperforming the other two groups. No cross-cultural differences were observed for spatial ability and mathematical anxiety. In all samples, symbolic magnitude processing and mathematical reasoning were independently related to early arithmetic. Other factors, such as non-symbolic magnitude processing, mental rotation, intelligence, and mathematical anxiety, produced differential patterns across the populations. The results are discussed in relation to potential influences of parental practice, school readiness, and linguistic factors on individual differences in early mathematics. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? Cross-cultural differences in mathematical ability are present in preschool children. Similar mechanisms of mathematical development operate in preschool children from the United Kingdom, Russia, and China. Tasks that require understanding of numbers are best predictors of arithmetic in preschool children. What does this study add? Cross-cultural differences in mathematical ability become greater with age/years of formal education. Similar mechanisms of mathematical development operate in early primary school children from the United Kingdom, Russia, and China. Symbolic number magnitude and mathematical reasoning are the main predictors of arithmetic in all three populations.", "A portable back massage robot which can complete the massage operations such as tapping, kneading and rolling was designed to improve the level of intelligence and massage effect. An efficient full covered path planning algorithm was put forward for a portable back massage robot to improve the coverage.\nCurrently, massage robots has become one of important research focuses with the increasing requirements for healthcare. The massage robot is difficult to be widely accepted as there are problems of massage robot in control, structure, and coverage path planning.\nThe 3D electromagnetic simulation model was established to optimize electromagnetic force. By analyzing the Traditional Chinese Medicine massage operation and the demands, the path planning algorithm models were established. The experimental platform of the massage robot was built.\nThe simulation results show presented path planning algorithm is suitable for back massage, which ensures that the massage robot traverse the entire back area with improved massage coverage. The tested results show that the massage effect is best when the duty cycle is in the range of 1/8 to 1/2, and the massage force increases with the increase of the input voltage.\nThe massage robot eventually achieved the desired massage effect, and the proposed efficient algorithm can effectively improve the coverage and promote the massage effect.", "Magnetic resonance imaging may be useful to assess disease severity in cerebral small vessel disease (SVD), identify those individuals who are most likely to progress to dementia, monitor disease progression, and act as surrogate markers to test new therapies. Texture analysis extracts information on the relationship between signal intensities of neighboring voxels. A potential advantage over techniques, such as diffusion tensor imaging, is that it can be used on clinically obtained magnetic resonance sequences. We determined whether texture parameters (TP) were abnormal in SVD, correlated with cognitive impairment, predicted cognitive decline, or conversion to dementia.\nIn the prospective SCANS study (St George's Cognition and Neuroimaging in Stroke), we assessed TP in 121 individuals with symptomatic SVD at baseline, 99 of whom attended annual cognitive testing for 5 years. Conversion to dementia was recorded for all subjects during the 5-year period. Texture analysis was performed on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery and T1-weighted images. The TP obtained from the SVD cohort were cross-sectionally compared with 54 age-matched controls scanned on the same magnetic resonance imaging system.\nThere were highly significant differences in several TP between SVD cases and controls. Within the SVD population, TP were highly correlated to other magnetic resonance imaging parameters (brain volume, white matter lesion volume, lacune count). TP correlated with executive function and global function at baseline and predicted conversion to dementia, after controlling for age, sex, premorbid intelligence quotient, and magnetic resonance parameters.\nTP, which can be obtained from routine clinical images, are abnormal in SVD, and the degree of abnormality correlates with executive dysfunction and global cognition at baseline and decline during 5 years. TP may be useful to assess disease severity in clinically collected data. This needs testing in data clinically acquired across multiple sites.", "During the preclinical research period of drug development, animal testing is widely used to help screen out a drug's dangerous side effects. However, it remains difficult to predict side effects within the central nervous system. Here, we introduce a machine learning-based in vitro system designed to detect seizure-inducing side effects before clinical trial. We recorded local field potentials from the CA1 alveus in acute mouse neocortico-hippocampal slices that were bath-perfused with each of 14 different drugs, and at 5 different concentrations of each drug. For each of these experimental conditions, we collected seizure-like neuronal activity and merged their waveforms as one graphic image, which was further converted into a feature vector using Caffe, an open framework for deep learning. In the space of the first two principal components, the support vector machine completely separated the vectors (i.e., doses of individual drugs) that induced seizure-like events, and identified diphenhydramine, enoxacin, strychnine and theophylline as \"seizure-inducing\" drugs, which have indeed been reported to induce seizures in clinical situations. Thus, this artificial intelligence-based classification may provide a new platform to pre-clinically detect seizure-inducing side effects of drugs.", "This study replicates and extends the findings of Koppehele-Gossel, Schnuerch, and Gibbons (2016) of a posterior semantic asymmetry (PSA) in event-related brain potentials (ERPs), which closely tracks the time course and degree of semantic activation from single visual words. This negativity peaked 300\u202fms after word onset, was derived by subtracting right- from left-side activity, and was larger in a semantic task compared to two non-semantic control tasks. The validity of the PSA in reflecting the effort to activate word meaning was again attested by a negative correlation between the meaning-specific PSA increase and verbal intelligence, even after controlling for nonverbal intelligence. Extending prior work, current source density (CSD) transformation was used. CSD results were consistent with a left temporo-parietal cortical origin of the PSA. Moreover, no PSA was found for pictorial material, suggesting that the component reflects early semantic processing specific to verbal stimuli.", "Nano-bio interfaces are emerging from the convergence of engineered nanomaterials and biological entities. Despite rapid growth, clinical translation of biomedical nanomaterials is heavily compromised by the lack of comprehensive understanding of biophysicochemical interactions at nano-bio interfaces. In the past decade, a few investigations have adopted a combinatorial approach toward decoding nano-bio interfaces. Combinatorial nano-bio interfaces comprise the design of nanocombinatorial libraries and high-throughput bioevaluation. In this Perspective, we address challenges in combinatorial nano-bio interfaces and call for multiparametric nanocombinatorics (composition, morphology, mechanics, surface chemistry), multiscale bioevaluation (biomolecules, organelles, cells, tissues/organs), and the recruitment of computational modeling and artificial intelligence. Leveraging combinatorial nano-bio interfaces will shed light on precision nanomedicine and its potential applications.", "Intellectual giftedness is usually defined in terms of having a very high Intellectual Quotient (IQ). The intellectual capacity is assessed by a standardized test such as the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC). However, the identification of intellectually gifted children (IGC) often remains time-consuming. A short-form WISC can be used as a screening instrument. The practitioners and researchers in this field can then make a more in-depth evaluation of the IGC's cognitive and socioemotional characteristics if needed. The aim of our study is thus to determine the best short tests, in terms of their psychometric qualities, for the identification of IGC. The current study is composed of three-step analyses. Firstly, we created nine IQs short forms (IQSF) with 2-subtests, and nine IQSF with 4-subtests from the WISC-IV (Wechsler, 2005). Secondly, we estimated psychometric parameters (i.e., reliability and validity) from empirical and simulated dataset with WISC-IV. The difference in the estimation of psychometric qualities of each IQSF from the simulated data is very close to those derived from empirical data. We thus selected the three best IQSF based on these psychometrics parameters estimated from simulated datasets. For each selected short form of the WISC-IV, we estimated the screening quality in our sample of IGC. Thirdly, we created IQSF with 2- and 4-subtests from the WISC-V (Wechsler, 2016) with simulated dataset. We then highlighted the three best short forms of WISC-V based on the estimated psychometric parameters. The results are interpreted in terms of validity, reliability and screening quality of IGC. In spite of the important changes in the WISC-V, our findings show that the 2-subtest form, Similitaries + Matrix Reasoning, and 4-subtest form, Similitaries + Vocabulary + Matrix Reasoning + Block Design, are the most efficient to identify the IGC at the two recent versions of Wechsler scales. Finally, we discuss the advantages and drawbacks of a brief assessment of intellectual aptitudes for the identification of the IGC.", "There is inadequate information regarding the factor structure of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children - Fifth UK Edition (WISC-VUK ; Wechsler, 2016a, Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Fifth UK Edition, Harcourt Assessment, London, UK) to guide interpretation.\nThe WISC-VUK was examined using complementary exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) for all models proposed by Wechsler (2016b, Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Fifth UK Edition: Administration and scoring manual, Harcourt Assessment, London, UK) as well as rival bifactor models.\nThe WISC-VUK standardization sample (N\u00a0=\u00a0415) correlation matrix was used in analyses due to denial of standardization sample raw data.\nEFA did not support a theoretically posited fifth factor because only one subtest (Matrix Reasoning) had a salient pattern coefficient on the fifth factor. A model with four group factors and a general intelligence factor resembling the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children - Fourth Edition (WISC-IV; Wechsler, 2003, Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Fourth Edition, Psychological Corporation, San Antonio, TX, USA) was supported by both EFA and CFA. General intelligence (g) was the dominant source of subtest variance and large omega-hierarchical coefficients supported interpretation of the Full Scale IQ (FSIQ) score. In contrast, the four group factors accounted for small portions of subtest variance and low omega-hierarchical subscale coefficients indicated that the four-factor index scores were of questionable interpretive value independent of g. Present results replicated independent assessments of the Canadian, Spanish, French, and US versions of the WISC-V (Canivez, Watkins, & Dombrowski, 2016, Psychological Assessment, 28, 975; 2017, Psychological Assessment, 29, 458; Fennollar-Cort\u00e9s & Watkins, 2018, International Journal of School & Educational Psychology; Lecerf & Canivez, 2018, Psychological Assessment; Watkins, Dombrowski, & Canivez, 2018, International Journal of School and Educational Psychology).\nPrimary interpretation of the WISC-VUK should be of the FSIQ as an estimate of general intelligence.", "The original aim of complex problem solving (CPS) research was to bring the cognitive demands of complex real-life problems into the lab in order to investigate problem solving behavior and performance under controlled conditions. Up until now, the validity of psychometric intelligence constructs has been scrutinized with regard to its importance for CPS performance. At the same time, different CPS measurement approaches competing for the title of the best way to assess CPS have been developed. In the first part of the paper, we investigate the predictability of CPS performance on the basis of the Berlin Intelligence Structure Model and Cattell's investment theory as well as an elaborated knowledge taxonomy. In the first study, 137 students managed a simulated shirt factory (Tailorshop; i.e., a complex real life-oriented system) twice, while in the second study, 152 students completed a forestry scenario (FSYS; i.e., a complex artificial world system). The results indicate that reasoning - specifically numerical reasoning (Studies 1 and 2) and figural reasoning (Study 2) - are the only relevant predictors among the intelligence constructs. We discuss the results with reference to the Brunswik symmetry principle. Path models suggest that reasoning and prior knowledge influence problem solving performance in the Tailorshop scenario mainly indirectly. In addition, different types of system-specific knowledge independently contribute to predicting CPS performance. The results of Study 2 indicate that working memory capacity, assessed as an additional predictor, has no incremental validity beyond reasoning. We conclude that (1) cognitive abilities and prior knowledge are substantial predictors of CPS performance, and (2) in contrast to former and recent interpretations, there is insufficient evidence to consider CPS a unique ability construct. In the second part of the paper, we discuss our results in light of recent CPS research, which predominantly utilizes the minimally complex systems (MCS) measurement approach. We suggest ecologically valid microworlds as an indispensable tool for future CPS research and applications.", "The vertiginous development of robotics, as part of the Artificial Intelligence, is currently raising its potential from the point of view of care. The purpose of the present article is the robotic implementation of a logical sequence model of the phases that happen in proper care. This requires approaching the representation and formalization of knowledge about care, what and how the care is: starting with the conceptual dissertation between life, and human characteristics, and also consider this care with the aim to lay the groundwork for Robots based on care..", "Automatic question answering (QA), which can greatly facilitate the access to information, is an important task in artificial intelligence. Recent years have witnessed the development of QA methods based on deep learning. However, a great amount of data is needed to train deep neural networks, and it is laborious to annotate training data for factoid QA of new domains or languages. In this paper, a distantly supervised method is proposed to automatically generate QA pairs. Additional efforts are paid to let the generated questions reflect the query interests and expression styles of users by exploring the community QA. Specifically, the generated questions are selected according to the estimated probabilities they are asked. Diverse paraphrases of questions are mined from community QA data, considering that the model trained on monotonous synthetic questions is very sensitive to variants of question expressions. Experimental results show that the model solely trained on generated data via the distant supervision and mined paraphrases could answer real-world questions with the accuracy of 49.34%. When limited annotated training data is available, significant improvements could be achieved by incorporating the generated data. An improvement of 1.35 absolute points is still observed on WebQA, a dataset with large-scale annotated training samples.", "Virtual Screening (VS) has emerged as an important tool in the drug development process, as it conducts efficient in silico searches over millions of compounds, ultimately increasing yields of potential drug leads. As a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML) is a powerful way of conducting VS for drug leads. ML for VS generally involves assembling a filtered training set of compounds, comprised of known actives and inactives. After training the model, it is validated and, if sufficiently accurate, used on previously unseen databases to screen for novel compounds with desired drug target binding activity.\nThe study aims to review ML-based methods used for VS and applications to Alzheimer's Disease (AD) drug discovery.\nTo update the current knowledge on ML for VS, we review thorough backgrounds, explanations, and VS applications of the following ML techniques: Na\u00efve Bayes (NB), k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forests (RF), and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN).\nAll techniques have found success in VS, but the future of VS is likely to lean more largely toward the use of neural networks - and more specifically, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), which are a subset of ANN that utilize convolution. We additionally conceptualize a work flow for conducting ML-based VS for potential therapeutics for AD, a complex neurodegenerative disease with no known cure and prevention. This both serves as an example of how to apply the concepts introduced earlier in the review and as a potential workflow for future implementation.\nDifferent ML techniques are powerful tools for VS, and they have advantages and disadvantages albeit. ML-based VS can be applied to AD drug development.", "Dyslexia is a disability that causes difficulties in reading and writing despite average intelligence. This hidden disability often goes undetected since dyslexics are normal and healthy in every other way. Electroencephalography (EEG) is one of the upcoming methods being researched for identifying unique brain activation patterns in dyslexics. The aims of this paper are to examine pros and cons of existing EEG-based pattern classification frameworks for dyslexia and recommend optimisations through the findings to assist future research. A critical analysis of the literature is conducted focusing on each framework's (1) data collection, (2) pre-processing, (3) analysis and (4) classification methods. A wide range of inputs as well as classification approaches has been experimented for the improvement in EEG-based pattern classification frameworks. It was uncovered that incorporating reading- and writing-related tasks to experiments used in data collection may help improve these frameworks instead of using only simple tasks, and those unwanted artefacts caused by body movements in the EEG signals during reading and writing activities could be minimised using artefact subspace reconstruction. Further, support vector machine is identified as a promising classifier to be used in EEG-based pattern classification frameworks for dyslexia.", "Early identification of critically ill patients who will require prolonged mechanical ventilation (PMV) has proven to be difficult. The purpose of this study was to use machine learning to identify patients at risk for PMV and tracheostomy placement.\nThe Multiparameter Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive Care III database was queried for all intensive care unit (ICU) stays with mechanical ventilation. PMV was defined as ventilation >7 d. Classifiers with a gradient-boosted decision trees algorithm were created for the outcomes of PMV and tracheostomy placement. The variables used were six different severity-of-illness scores calculated on the first day of ICU admission including their components and 30 comorbidities. Mean receiver operating characteristic curves were calculated for the outcomes, and variable importance was quantified.\nThere were 20,262 ICU stays identified. PMV was required in 13.6%, and tracheostomy was performed in 6.6% of patients. The classifier for predicting PMV was able to achieve a mean area under the curve (AUC) of 0.820\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.016, and tracheostomy was predicted with an AUC of 0.830\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.011. There were 60.7% patients admitted to a surgical ICU, and the classifiers for these patients predicted PMV with an AUC of 0.852\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.017 and tracheostomy with an AUC of 0.869\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.015. The variable with the highest importance for predicting PMV was the logistic organ dysfunction score pulmonary component (13%), and the most important comorbidity in predicting tracheostomy was cardiac arrhythmia (12%).\nThis study demonstrates the use of artificial intelligence through machine-learning classifiers for the early identification of patients at risk for PMV and tracheostomy. Application of these identification techniques could lead to improved outcomes by allowing for early intervention.", "A fully-labeled image dataset provides a unique resource for reproducible research inquiries and data analyses in several computational fields, such as computer vision, machine learning and deep learning machine intelligence. With the present contribution, a large-scale fully-labeled image dataset is provided, and made publicly and freely available to the research community. The current dataset entitled MCIndoor20000 includes more than 20,000 digital images from three different indoor object categories, including doors, stairs, and hospital signs. To make a comprehensive dataset addressing current challenges that exist in indoor objects modeling, we cover a multiple set of variations in images, such as rotation, intra-class variation plus various noise models. The current dataset is freely and publicly available at https://github.com/bircatmcri/MCIndoor20000.", "Relating ion channel (iCh) structural dynamics to physiological function remains a challenge. Current experimental and computational techniques have limited ability to explore this relationship in atomistic detail over physiological timescales. A framework associating iCh structure to function is necessary for elucidating normal and disease mechanisms. We formulated a modeling schema that overcomes the limitations of current methods through applications of artificial intelligence machine learning. Using this approach, we studied molecular processes that underlie human IKs voltage-mediated gating. IKs malfunction underlies many debilitating and life-threatening diseases. Molecular components of IKs that underlie its electrophysiological function include KCNQ1 (a pore-forming tetramer) and KCNE1 (an auxiliary subunit). Simulations, using the IKs structure-function model, reproduced experimentally recorded saturation of gating-charge displacement at positive membrane voltages, two-step voltage sensor (VS) movement shown by fluorescence, iCh gating statistics, and current-voltage relationship. Mechanistic insights include the following: 1) pore energy profile determines iCh subconductance; 2) the entire protein structure, not limited to the pore, contributes to pore energy and channel subconductance; 3) interactions with KCNE1 result in two distinct VS movements, causing gating-charge saturation at positive membrane voltages and current activation delay; and 4) flexible coupling between VS and pore permits pore opening at lower VS positions, resulting in sequential gating. The new modeling approach is applicable to atomistic scale studies of other proteins on timescales of physiological function.", "Rhinoceros (rhinos) have suffered a dramatic increase in poaching over the past decade due to the growing demand for rhino horn products in Asia. One way to reverse this trend is to enhance enforcement and intelligence gathering tools used for species identification of horns, in particular making them fast, inexpensive and accurate. Traditionally, species identification tests are based on DNA sequence data, which, depending on laboratory resources, can be either time or cost prohibitive. This study presents a rapid rhino species identification test, utilizing species-specific primers within the cytochrome b gene multiplexed in a single reaction, with a presumptive species identification based on the length of the resultant amplicon. This multiplex PCR assay can provide a presumptive species identification result in less than 24 hours. Sequence-based definitive testing can be conducted if/when required (e.g. court purposes). This work also presents an actual casework scenario in which the presumptive test was successfully utlitised, in concert with sequence-based definitive testing. The test was carried out on seized suspected rhino horns tested at the Institute of Ecology and Biological Resources, the CITES mandated laboratory in Vietnam, a country that is known to be a major source of demand for rhino horns. This test represents the basis for which future 'rapid species identification tests' can be trialed.", "Having accurate, detailed, and up-to-date information about the location and behavior of animals in the wild would improve our ability to study and conserve ecosystems. We investigate the ability to automatically, accurately, and inexpensively collect such data, which could help catalyze the transformation of many fields of ecology, wildlife biology, zoology, conservation biology, and animal behavior into \"big data\" sciences. Motion-sensor \"camera traps\" enable collecting wildlife pictures inexpensively, unobtrusively, and frequently. However, extracting information from these pictures remains an expensive, time-consuming, manual task. We demonstrate that such information can be automatically extracted by deep learning, a cutting-edge type of artificial intelligence. We train deep convolutional neural networks to identify, count, and describe the behaviors of 48 species in the 3.2 million-image Snapshot Serengeti dataset. Our deep neural networks automatically identify animals with >93.8% accuracy, and we expect that number to improve rapidly in years to come. More importantly, if our system classifies only images it is confident about, our system can automate animal identification for 99.3% of the data while still performing at the same 96.6% accuracy as that of crowdsourced teams of human volunteers, saving >8.4 y (i.e., >17,000 h at 40 h/wk) of human labeling effort on this 3.2 million-image dataset. Those efficiency gains highlight the importance of using deep neural networks to automate data extraction from camera-trap images, reducing a roadblock for this widely used technology. Our results suggest that deep learning could enable the inexpensive, unobtrusive, high-volume, and even real-time collection of a wealth of information about vast numbers of animals in the wild.", "Pulmonary nodule recognition is the core module of lung CAD. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm has been widely used in pulmonary nodule recognition, and the algorithm of Multiple Kernel Learning Support Vector Machine (MKL-SVM) has achieved good results therein. Based on grid search, however, the MKL-SVM algorithm needs long optimization time in course of parameter optimization; also its identification accuracy depends on the fineness of grid. In the paper, swarm intelligence is introduced and the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is combined with MKL-SVM algorithm to be MKL-SVM-PSO algorithm so as to realize global optimization of parameters rapidly. In order to obtain the global optimal solution, different inertia weights such as constant inertia weight, linear inertia weight, and nonlinear inertia weight are applied to pulmonary nodules recognition. The experimental results show that the model training time of the proposed MKL-SVM-PSO algorithm is only 1/7 of the training time of the MKL-SVM grid search algorithm, achieving better recognition effect. Moreover, Euclidean norm of normalized error vector is proposed to measure the proximity between the average fitness curve and the optimal fitness curve after convergence. Through statistical analysis of the average of 20 times operation results with different inertial weights, it can be seen that the dynamic inertial weight is superior to the constant inertia weight in the MKL-SVM-PSO algorithm. In the dynamic inertial weight algorithm, the parameter optimization time of nonlinear inertia weight is shorter; the average fitness value after convergence is much closer to the optimal fitness value, which is better than the linear inertial weight. Besides, a better nonlinear inertial weight is verified.", "This study examined individual differences in mathematics learning by combining antecedent (A), opportunity (O), and propensity (P) indicators within the Opportunity-Propensity Model. Although there is already some evidence for this model based on secondary datasets, there currently is no primary data available that simultaneously takes into account A, O, and P factors in children with and without Mathematical Learning Disabilities (MLD). Therefore, the mathematical abilities of 114 school-aged children (grade 3 till 6) with and without MLD were analyzed and combined with information retrieved from standardized tests and questionnaires. Results indicated significant differences in personality, motivation, temperament, subjective well-being, self-esteem, self-perceived competence, and parental aspirations when comparing children with and without MLD. In addition, A, O, and P factors were found to underlie mathematical abilities and disabilities. For the A factors, parental aspirations explained about half of the variance in fact retrieval speed in children without MLD, and SES was especially involved in the prediction of procedural accuracy in general. Teachers' experience contributed as O factor and explained about 6% of the variance in mathematical abilities. P indicators explained between 52 and 69% of the variance, with especially intelligence as overall significant predictor. Indirect effects pointed towards the interrelatedness of the predictors and the value of including A, O, and P indicators in a comprehensive model. The role parental aspirations played in fact retrieval speed was partially mediated through the self-perceived competence of the children, whereas the effect of SES on procedural accuracy was partially mediated through intelligence in children of both groups and through working memory capacity in children with MLD. Moreover, in line with the componential structure of mathematics, our findings were dependent on the math task used. Different A, O, and P indicators seemed to be important for fact retrieval speed compared to procedural accuracy. Also, mathematical development type (MLD or typical development) mattered since some A, O, and P factors were predictive for MLD only and the other way around. Practical implications of these findings and recommendations for future research on MLD and on individual differences in mathematical abilities are provided.", "To help clinicians to efficiently diagnose the severity of a person's depression, the affective computing community and the artificial intelligence field have shown a growing interest in designing automated systems. The speech features have useful information for the diagnosis of depression. However, manually designing and domain knowledge are still important for the selection of the feature, which makes the process labor consuming and subjective. In recent years, deep-learned features based on neural networks have shown superior performance to hand-crafted features in various areas. In this paper, to overcome the difficulties mentioned above, we propose a combination of hand-crafted and deep-learned features which can effectively measure the severity of depression from speech. In the proposed method, Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNN) are firstly built to learn deep-learned features from spectrograms and raw speech waveforms. Then we manually extract the state-of-the-art texture descriptors named median robust extended local binary patterns (MRELBP) from spectrograms. To capture the complementary information within the hand-crafted features and deep-learned features, we propose joint fine-tuning layers to combine the raw and spectrogram DCNN to boost the depression recognition performance. Moreover, to address the problems with small samples, a data augmentation method was proposed. Experiments conducted on AVEC2013 and AVEC2014 depression databases show that our approach is robust and effective for the diagnosis of depression when compared to state-of-the-art audio-based methods.", "Healthcare is considered as one of the most promising areas where big data can be applied to foster innovation for the benefit of patients and of the whole system. Healthcare analytics have the potential to accelerate R&D, increase knowledge on diseases and risk factors, improve treatments, develop personalised medicine, help physicians with decision support systems\u2026 The access to data is also a driving force for patients' empowerment and for the democratic debate. However, there are also concerns about the societal, economic and ethic impacts of this wave of digitization and of the growing use of data, algorithms and artificial intelligence. Given the issues at stake, collecting and analysing data generated by health care systems is a strategic challenge in all countries; in that respect the French National System of Health Data (a national data warehouse linking data from several sources and giving a vision of the care pathways for the entire population, with a ten-year history) is an asset, but it has to be completed and enriched with data from electronic health records.", "In this paper, an automatic design method based on a swarm intelligence approach for CMOS analog integrated circuit (IC) design is presented. The hybrid meta-heuristics optimization technique, namely, the salp swarm algorithm (SSA), is applied to the optimal sizing of a CMOS differential amplifier and the comparator circuit. SSA is a nature-inspired optimization algorithm which mimics the navigating and hunting behavior of salp. The hybrid SSA is applied to optimize the circuit design parameters and to minimize the MOS transistor sizes. The proposed swarm intelligence approach was successfully implemented for an automatic design and optimization of CMOS analog ICs using Generic Process Design Kit (GPDK) 180 nm technology. The circuit design parameters and design specifications are validated through a simulation program for integrated circuit emphasis simulator. To investigate the efficiency of the proposed approach, comparisons have been carried out with other simulation-based circuit design methods. The performances of hybrid SSA based CMOS analog IC designs are better than the previously reported studies.", "An important yet challenging problem in LINAC-based rotational arc radiation therapy is the design of beam trajectory, which requires simultaneous consideration of delivery efficiency and final dose distribution. In this work, we propose a novel trajectory selection strategy by developing a Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) algorithm during the beam trajectory selection process. To search through the vast number of possible trajectories, the MCTS algorithm was implemented. In this approach, a candidate trajectory is explored by starting from a leaf node and sequentially examining the next level of linked nodes with consideration of geometric and physical constraints. The maximum Upper Confidence Bounds for Trees, which is a function of average objective function value and the number of times the node under testing has been visited, was employed to intelligently select the trajectory. For each candidate trajectory, we run an inverse fluence map optimization with an infinity norm regularization. The ranking of the plan as measured by the corresponding objective function value was then fed back to update the statistics of the nodes on the trajectory. The method was evaluated with a chest wall and a brain case, and the results were compared with the coplanar and noncoplanar 4pi beam configurations. For both clinical cases, the MCTS method found effective and easy-to-deliver trajectories within an hour. As compared with the coplanar plans, it offers much better sparing of the OARs while maintaining the PTV coverage. The quality of the MCTS-generated plan is found to be comparable to the 4pi plans. Artificial intelligence based on MCTS is valuable to facilitate the design of beam trajectory and paves the way for future clinical use of non-coplanar treatment delivery.", "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) annually claims more lives and costs more dollars than any other disease globally amid widening health disparities, despite the known significant reductions in this burden by low cost dietary changes. The world's first medical school-based teaching kitchen therefore launched CHOP-Medical Students as the largest known multisite cohort study of hands-on cooking and nutrition education versus traditional curriculum for medical students.\nThis analysis provides a novel integration of artificial intelligence-based machine learning (ML) with causal inference statistics. 43 ML automated algorithms were tested, with the top performer compared to triply robust propensity score-adjusted multilevel mixed effects regression panel analysis of longitudinal data. Inverse-variance weighted fixed effects meta-analysis pooled the individual estimates for competencies.\n3,248 unique medical trainees met study criteria from 20 medical schools nationally from August 1, 2012, to June 26, 2017, generating 4,026 completed validated surveys. ML analysis produced similar results to the causal inference statistics based on root mean squared error and accuracy. Hands-on cooking and nutrition education compared to traditional medical school curriculum significantly improved student competencies (OR 2.14, 95% CI 2.00-2.28, p < 0.001) and MedDiet adherence (OR 1.40, 95% CI 1.07-1.84, p = 0.015), while reducing trainees' soft drink consumption (OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.37-0.85, p = 0.007). Overall improved competencies were demonstrated from the initial study site through the scale-up of the intervention to 10 sites nationally (p < 0.001).\nThis study provides the first machine learning-augmented causal inference analysis of a multisite cohort showing hands-on cooking and nutrition education for medical trainees improves their competencies counseling patients on nutrition, while improving students' own diets. This study suggests that the public health and medical sectors can unite population health management and precision medicine for a sustainable model of next-generation health systems providing effective, equitable, accessible care beginning with reversing the CVD epidemic.", "Perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are widespread persistent organic compounds that have been suggested to affect neurodevelopment.\nWe aimed to evaluate whether prenatal exposure to PFASs is associated with IQ in children.\nWe studied 1,592 pregnancies enrolled in the Danish National Birth Cohort (DNBC) during 1996-2002. Sixteen PFASs were measured in maternal plasma collected in early gestation. Child IQ was assessed at 5 y of age using the Wechsler Primary and Preschool Scales of Intelligence-Revised (WPPSI-R) administered by trained psychologists. Using multivariable linear regression models, we estimated the differences in child IQ scores according to PFAS concentration [per natural-log (ng/mL) unit increase or values categorized in quartiles].\nPerfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) were detected in all samples, and five additional PFASs were quantified in >80% of the samples. Overall, we found no strong associations between a natural-log unit increase in each of the seven PFASs we evaluated and child IQ scores. A few positive and negative associations were found in the sex-stratified PFAS quartile analyses, but the patterns were inconsistent.\nOverall, we did not find consistent evidence to suggest prenatal exposure to PFASs to be associated with child IQ scores at 5 y of age in the DNBC. Some of the sex-specific observations warrant further investigation. Additional studies should examine offspring IQ at older ages and assess other functional cognitive and neuropsychiatric measures in addition to intelligence. Postnatal exposures to PFASs and mixture effects for PFASs and PFASs with other environmental pollutants should also be considered in future research. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP2754.", "Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is characterized by inappropriate levels of hyperactivity, impulsivity, and/or inattention. Individuals with ADHD may present limitations with regard to executive functions and performing activities that involve planning and/or attention/concentration. The aim of the study was to investigate the association between dental caries and signs of ADHD in a representative sample of schoolchildren. A representative sample of 851 schoolchildren aged seven to 12 years was randomly selected from public and private schools. Data acquisition involved a clinical dental examination for cavitated permanent and deciduous teeth using the DMFT/dmft indices. Neuropsychological evaluations, including the assessment of intelligence (Raven's Colored Progressive Matrix Test) and executive functions (Corsi Tapping Blocks tests and Digit Span test) were also performed. Parents/caregivers and teachers answered the SNAP-IV Questionnaire for the investigation of signs of inattention and hyperactivity in the family and school environment. Parents/caregivers also answered questionnaires addressing socioeconomic and socio-demographic characteristics. Descriptive analysis of the variables and Poisson regression with robust variance were performed. Parental reports of signs of inattention (PR: 1.28; p < 0.05) and hyperactivity (PR: 1.15; p < 0.05) were associated with a greater occurrence of caries. A better performance on the backward order of the Corsi Tapping Blocks tests (PR: 0.94; p < 0.05) and higher level of mother's schooling were associated with a lower frequency of caries. A better performance on executive function tasks was a protective factor against dental caries, whereas children considered inattentive and/or hyperactive by their parents had a higher prevalence rate of dental caries.", "As Twitter has become an active data source for health surveillance research, it is important that efficient and effective methods are developed to identify tweets related to personal health experience. Conventional classification algorithms rely on features engineered by human domain experts, and engineering such features is a challenging task and requires much human intelligence. The resultant features may not be optimal for the classification problem, and can make it challenging for conventional classifiers to correctly predict personal experience tweets (PETs) due to the various ways to express and/or describe personal experience in tweets. In this study, we developed a method that combines word embedding and long short-term memory (LSTM) model without the need to engineer any specific features. Through word embedding, tweet texts were represented as dense vectors which in turn were fed to the LSTM neural network as sequences.\nStatistical analyses of the results of 10-fold cross-validations of our method and conventional methods indicate that there exist significant differences (p\u2009<\u20090.01) in performance measures of accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC/AUC, demonstrating that our approach outperforms the conventional methods in identifying PETs.\nWe presented an efficient and effective method of identifying health-related personal experience tweets by combining word embedding and an LSTM neural network. It is conceivable that our method can help accelerate and scale up analyzing textual data of social media for health surveillance purposes, because of no need for the laborious and costly process of engineering features.", "Although lifespan is increasing, there is no evidence to suggest that older people are experiencing better health in their later years than previous generations. Nutrition, at all stages of life, plays an important role in determining health and wellbeing.\nA roundtable meeting of UK experts on nutrition and ageing considered key aspects of the diet-ageing relationship and developed a consensus position on the main priorities for research and public health actions that are required to help people live healthier lives as they age.\nThe group consensus highlighted the requirement for a life course approach, recognising the multifactorial nature of the impact of ageing. Environmental and lifestyle influences at any life stage are modified by genetic factors and early development. The response to the environment at each stage of life can determine the impact of lifestyle later on. There are no key factors that act in isolation to determine patterns of ageing and it is a combination of environmental and social factors that drives healthy or unhealthy ageing. Too little is known about how contemporary dietary patterns and sedentary lifestyles will impact upon healthy ageing in future generations and this is a priority for future research.\nThere is good evidence to support change to lifestyle (i.e. diet, nutrition and physical) activity in relation to maintaining or improving body composition, cognitive health and emotional intelligence, immune function and vascular health. Lifestyle change at any stage of life may extend healthy lifespan, although the impact of early changes appears to be greatest.", "Association between home environment and the behavioral and neurocognitive development of children from a community childcare center for low-income families was examined (aged 6 to 12 years, n=155).\nThe parents performed a questionnaire on home environment (K-HOME-Q) to assess home environment including parenting attitude and the Child Behavior Checklist (K-CBCL). The children performed the Wechsler Intelligence (IQ) Scale, Stroop interference test (Stroop), word fluency test (WF), and design fluency test (DF) to assess their neurocognitive development.\n'Nurturing of Development' and 'Variety of Language Interaction' scores from the K-HOME-Q, were inversely associated with total behavior problems, externalization, rule-breaking, and aggressive behavior subscales of K-CBCL, and 'Emotional atmosphere' and 'Tolerance toward the child' scores showed inverse associations with the total behavior problems, rule-breaking, aggressive behavior, and withdrawn/depressed subscales. Despite economic hardship, the mean scores of the neurocognitive tests were comparable to the average level of Korean children's normative sample. However, 'Nurturing of Development' and 'Tolerance toward the Child' score of K-HOME-Q were associated with better executive function (IQ, WF, DF).\nThese results suggest that parental stimulation of development and tolerant parenting attitude may offer protection against the negative effects of suboptimal economic environment on children's behavior and neurocognitive development.", "To examine metacognitive ability (MC) following moderate to severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) using an empirical assessment approach and to determine the relationship between alterations in gray matter volume (GMV) and MC.\nA sample of 62 individuals (TBI n = 34; healthy control [HC] n = 28) were included in the study. Neuroimaging and neuropsychological data were collected for all participants during the same visit. MC was quantified using an approach borrowed from signal detection theory (Type II area under the receiver operating characteristic curve calculation) to evaluate judgments during a modified version of the 3rd edition of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale's Matrix Reasoning subtest where half of the items were presented randomly and half were presented in the order of increasing difficulty. Retrospective confidence judgments were collected on an item-by-item basis. Brain volumetric analyses were conducted using FreeSurfer software.\nAnalyses of the modified Matrix Reasoning task data demonstrated that HCs significantly outperformed TBIs (ordered: d = .63; random: d = .58). There was a significant difference between groups for MC for the randomly presented stimuli (d = .54) but not the ordered stimuli. There was an association between GMV and MC in the TBI group between the right orbital region and MC (R2 = .11). In the HC group, there were associations between the left posterior (R2 = .17), left orbital (R2 = .29), and left dorsolateral (R2 = .21) regions and MC.\nThese results are consistent with those of previous research on MC in the cognitive neurosciences, but this study demonstrates that injury may moderate the regional contributions to MC.

In this study, we aim to explore the relationships between multiple heavy metals (manganese, lead, cadmium, mercury, antimony, and bismuth), neurocognitive function, and ADHD symptoms. Methods: We recruited 29 patients with ADHD inattentive type (ADHD-I), 47 patients with ADHD hyperactivity/impulsivity type (ADHD-H/I), and 46 healthy control children. Urine samples were obtained to measure the levels of the aforementioned heavy metals in each child. Participants&rsquo; cognitive function and clinical symptoms were assessed, respectively. Results: We found ADHD-H/I patients demonstrated the highest antimony levels (p = 0.028), and ADHD-I patients demonstrated the highest cadmium levels (p = 0.034). Antimony levels were positively correlated with the severity of ADHD symptoms that were rated by teachers, and cadmium levels were negatively correlated with the Full Scale Intelligence Quotient. Lead levels were negatively correlated with most indices of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children\u207bFourth Edition (WISC-IV), but positively correlated with inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity symptoms (p < 0.05). Conclusion: Lead, cadmium and antimony were associated with susceptibility to ADHD and symptom severity in school-age children. Eliminating exposure to heavy metals may help to prevent neurodevelopmental disorders in children.", "Population intelligence quotients increased throughout the 20th century-a phenomenon known as the Flynn effect-although recent years have seen a slowdown or reversal of this trend in several countries. To distinguish between the large set of proposed explanations, we categorize hypothesized causal factors by whether they accommodate the existence of within-family Flynn effects. Using administrative register data and cognitive ability scores from military conscription data covering three decades of Norwegian birth cohorts (1962-1991), we show that the observed Flynn effect, its turning point, and subsequent decline can all be fully recovered from within-family variation. The analysis controls for all factors shared by siblings and finds no evidence for prominent causal hypotheses of the decline implicating genes and environmental factors that vary between, but not within, families.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) is projected to substantially influence clinical practice in the foreseeable future. However, despite the excitement around the technologies, it is yet rare to see examples of robust clinical validation of the technologies and, as a result, very few are currently in clinical use. A thorough, systematic validation of AI technologies using adequately designed clinical research studies before their integration into clinical practice is critical to ensure patient benefit and safety while avoiding any inadvertent harms. We would like to suggest several specific points regarding the role that peer-reviewed medical journals can play, in terms of study design, registration, and reporting, to help achieve proper and meaningful clinical validation of AI technologies designed to make medical diagnosis and prediction, focusing on the evaluation of diagnostic accuracy efficacy. Peer-reviewed medical journals can encourage investigators who wish to validate the performance of AI systems for medical diagnosis and prediction to pay closer attention to the factors listed in this article by emphasizing their importance. Thereby, peer-reviewed medical journals can ultimately facilitate translating the technological innovations into real-world practice while securing patient safety and benefit.", "Previous research shows that children with reading disorders perform poorly on auditory processing (AP) tasks. Correlational studies have also shown significant associations between some AP tasks and word and nonword reading. There is less clear evidence for AP contributions to spelling and passage reading. The aim of this research was to extend current knowledge by investigating the association between a range of AP measures used clinically and children's reading of words, nonwords, and passages, as well as word spelling.\nRegression analyses were conducted on data from 90 children 7 to 13 years of age (58 males) with reported listening and/or reading concerns. All children had normal hearing sensitivity and were tested on AP tasks including the frequency pattern test (FPT), dichotic digits test, random gap detection test, and the masking level difference. Reading tasks included word, nonword, and passage reading. Phonologic processing, core language skills, nonverbal intelligence, memory, and attention were also measured.\nAll multiregression analyses were fixed order with age and gender, nonverbal intelligence, core language, phoneme manipulation, and digits backward scores included in the model before AP measures. FPT was the only AP task that accounted for significant unique variance in word/nonword reading and nonword spelling, but not passage reading.\nThe findings from this study failed to show an association between many clinically used AP measures and children's reading and spelling outcomes. Nevertheless, they reiterate the importance of evaluating FPT in children with word reading disorders. The findings justify further investigation into the role of this test when diagnosing children with reading or spelling disorders.", "We describe here the clinical outcome of four women with epilepsy with eyelid myoclonia (aged 21-53\u2009years). All patients had an uneventful early history, normal physical growth and appearance and no comorbid sensory or motor disability and normal brain magnetic resonance imaging finding. Two women were moderately and one mildly intellectually disabled and one showed a low-average intelligence. The overall well-being of the patients was hampered by psychiatric or various somatic comorbidities and related psychosocial problems. The three women with an intellectual disability had been treated with narrow-spectrum antiepileptic drugs and one also with vigabatrin during childhood and adolescence. The patient with a low-average intelligence had been on broad-spectrum antiepileptic medication (i.e. valproate and ethosuximide) since the epilepsy diagnosis but she has had compliance problems. Based on these cases, the cognitive deficits in patients with epilepsy with eyelid myoclonia may occur more commonly than what has been thought hitherto. We discuss the role of narrow-spectrum antiepileptic drugs as a contributing factor to poor seizure control and an impaired intelligence.", "The aim of this study was to characterize the neuropsychological features of a representative sample of Sleep-related Hypermotor Epilepsy (SHE) patients and to highlight clinical associations.\nThis cross-sectional study included 60 consecutive patients with video/video-electroencephalography-documented SHE. All were assessed by measures of intelligence. Individuals with normal scores underwent a standardized battery of tests. The Fisher exact test and Wilcoxon rank-sum test for statistical analysis.\nMean total IQ was 96.96\u00a0\u00b1\u00a021.50, with significant differences between verbal and performance scores (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). Nine patients (15%) had intellectual disability (ID)/cognitive deterioration. Of the 49 assessed by the extensive battery, 23 (46.9%) showed deficits in at least one test evaluating phonemic fluency (24.5%), memory (24.5%), inhibitory control (22.4%), or working memory (10.2%). Patients with mutations in SHE genes had lower IQ than patients without mutations, irrespective of the specific gene (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0176). Similarly, pathological neurological examination (NE) and \"any underlying brain disorder\" (at least one among pathological NE, abnormal brain magnetic resonance imaging findings, perinatal insult) were associated with ID (p\u00a0=\u00a00.029, p\u00a0=\u00a00.036). A higher seizure frequency at last assessment and poor prognosis correlated with worse scores in visuo-spatial memory (p\u00a0=\u00a00.038, p\u00a0=\u00a00.040) and visuo-spatial abilities (p\u00a0=\u00a00.016). Status epilepticus (p\u00a0=\u00a00.035), poor response to antiepileptic drugs (p\u00a0=\u00a00.033), and poor prognosis (p\u00a0=\u00a00.020) correlated with lower shifting abilities, whereas bilateral convulsive seizures correlated with worse working memory (p\u00a0=\u00a00.049).\nIn all, 53.3% of SHE patients had neuropsychological deficits. The profile of impairment showed worse verbal IQ, as well as deficits in extrafrontal and selective frontal functions. Our data support the contribution of genetics in ID by different biological mechanisms. Variables of clinical severity affect memory and executive functioning.", "To explore the types of exemplary professional behaviors and the facilitators and barriers to professional behavior discussed by student-mentor dyads during appreciative inquiry (AI) dialogs.\nWe conducted a qualitative analysis of AI narratives discussing exemplary professional practice written by third-year medical students following a dialog with mentors. Narratives were thematically analyzed using directed content analysis to explore the types of exemplary professional behaviors discussed and the facilitators and barriers to professional practice. Narratives were coded independently by two investigators; codes were finalized, themes were derived, and a model on how exemplary professional behaviors are nurtured and reinforced was developed.\nThemes addressed humanism toward others and excellence, with altruism being an underlying implicit guiding principle behind professional behavior. Humanism toward self was infrequently discussed as an aspect of professionalism, but when discussed, was perceived to foster resilience. Principle-based attitudes and emotional intelligence facilitated professional behaviors. Programmatic scaffolds facilitated professional behavior and included curricula on reflective practice, mentorship, promoting learner autonomy and connectedness, and a safe environment.\nAI is an effective strategy that can be used to stimulate learner reflection on professionalism, humanism, and wellness and promote learner acknowledgement of positive aspects of the learning environment.", "To determine characteristics and concordance of subjective cognitive complaints (SCCs) 6\u00a0months following mild-traumatic brain injury (mTBI) as assessed by two different TBI common data elements (CDEs).\nThe Transforming Research and Clinical Knowledge in Traumatic Brain Injury (TRACK-TBI) Pilot Study was a prospective observational study that utilized the NIH TBI CDEs, Version 1.0. We examined variables associated with SCC, performance on objective cognitive tests (Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, California Verbal Learning Test, and Trail Making Tests A and B), and agreement on self-report of SCCs as assessed by the acute concussion evaluation (ACE) versus the Rivermead Post Concussion Symptoms Questionnaire (RPQ).\nIn total, 68% of 227 participants endorsed SCCs at 6\u00a0months. Factors associated with SCC included less education, psychiatric history, and being assaulted. Compared to participants without SCC, those with SCC defined by RPQ performed significantly worse on all cognitive tests. There was moderate agreement between the two measures of SCCs (kappa\u00a0=\u00a00.567 to 0.680).\nWe show that the symptom questionnaires ACE and RPQ show good, but not excellent, agreement for SCCs in an mTBI study population. Our results support the retention of RPQ as a basic CDE for mTBI research.\nBSI-18: Brief Symptom Inventory; 18CDEs: common data elements; CT: computed tomography; CVLT: California Verbal Learning Test; ED: emergency department; GCS: Glasgow coma scale; LOC: loss of consciousnessm; TBI: mild-traumatic brain injury; PTA: post-traumatic amnesia; SCC: subjective cognitive complaints; TBI: traumatic brain injury; TRACK-TBI: Transforming Research and Clinical Knowledge in Traumatic Brain Injury; TMT: Trail Making Test; WAIS-PSI: Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, Fourth Edition, Processing Speed Index.", "To describe the accuracy of the Bayley Scales of Infant Development-Second Edition (BSID-II) Mental Development Index (MDI) at 2 years of age for prediction of cognitive function at school age of children born extremely preterm.\nStudy participants were enrolled in the Extremely Low Gestational Age Newborn Study between 2002 and 2004. Two-thirds of surviving children (n\u2009=\u2009795) were assessed at 2 years with the BSID-II and at 10 years with an intelligence quotient (IQ) test. We computed test characteristics for a low MDI (<70), including predictive value positive.\nAlmost two-thirds of children with a low MDI had a normal IQ (\u2265\u200970) at 10 years. Concordance between MDI and IQ was highest among children with major motor and/or sensory impairment, and when MDI was adjusted for gestational age.\nMost children born extremely preterm with low BSID-II MDI at 2 years have normal intelligence at school age.", "Emotional Intelligence and critical thinking are regarded as important traits that nurses have which may influence the quality of their work including clinical decision-making and reasoning ability and adoption of evidence-based practice and practice-based knowledge.\nThe aim of this study is to investigate nursing students' critical thinking dispositions and emotional intelligence as an essential skill, over the course of the undergraduate nursing program.\nA longitudinal design.\nThe research study was conducted as a longitudinal design. The target group of this study consists of 182 students studying at the faculty of nursing. Asymmetrical cluster sampling method has been applied to select the sample group and all students in their first academic year were included in the study.\nInformation Form, California Critical Thinking Disposition Scale and Emotional Intelligence Assessment Scale were used in order to collect data. The data was analyzed by using frequency, standard deviation, Kruskal Wallis and Bonferroni test.\nThere was no relationship between sub-dimensions of emotional intelligence respectively; awareness of emotions, empathy, social skills in the first academic year and critical thinking disposition and the end of academic year. A moderate correlation was found in the positive direction between the self-motivation at the beginning of the academic year and critical thinking disposition at the end of the final academic year.\nIt is recommended that the nursing scholarship investigates the current issues on the subjects of emotional intelligence and critical thinking in detail, discuss different aspects of the subjects and debate over the criticisms. Briefly, the discussion should go beyond the scope of nursing and include different aspects.", "Sensory neurons within skin form an interface between the external physical reality and the inner tactile perception. This interface enables sensory information to be organized identified, and interpreted through perceptual learning-the process whereby the sensing abilities improve through experience. Here, an artificial sensory neuron that can integrate and differentiate the spatiotemporal features of touched patterns for recognition is shown. The system comprises sensing, transmitting, and processing components that are parallel to those found in a sensory neuron. A resistive pressure sensor converts pressure stimuli into electric signals, which are transmitted to a synaptic transistor through interfacial ionic/electronic coupling via a soft ionic conductor. Furthermore, the recognition error rate can be dramatically decreased from 44% to 0.4% by integrating with the machine learning method. This work represents a step toward the design and use of neuromorphic electronic skin with artificial intelligence for robotics and prosthetics.", "Pedophilia is a heterogeneous disorder for which the neurobiological correlates are not well established. In particular, there are no biological markers identifying individuals with high risk to commit child sexual offense (CSO). Pedophiles with CSO (P+CSO; N = 73), pedophiles without CSO (P-CSO; N = 77), and non-pedophilic controls (NPC; N = 133) were assessed using multimodal structural neuroimaging measures including: cortical thickness (CT), surface area (SA), and white matter fractional anisotropy (FA), as well as full scale IQ (FSIQ) performance. Cortex-wise mediation analyses were used to assess the relationships among brain structure, FSIQ and CSO behavior. Lower FSIQ performance was strongly predict with P+CSO (Wald Chi2 = 13.0, p = 3.1 \u00d7 10-5). P+CSO had lower CT in the right motor cortex and pronounced reductions in SA spanning the bilateral frontal, temporal, cingulate, and insular regions (PFWE-corrected < 0.05). P+CSO also had lower FA particularly in the corpus callosum (PFWE-corrected < 0.05). The relationship between SA and P+CSO was significantly mediated by FSIQ, particularly in the prefrontal and anterior insular cortices (PFWE-corrected < 0.05). Within P+CSO, left prefrontal and right anterior cingulate SA negatively correlated with number of CSOs (PFWE-corrected < 0.05). This study demonstrates converging neurobiological findings in which P+CSO had lower FSIQ performance, reduced CT, reduced SA, and reduced FA, compared to P-CSO as well as NPC. Further, FSIQ potentially mediates abuse by pedophiles via aberrant SA, whereas the CT and FA associations were independent of FSIQ differences. These findings suggest aberrant neuroanatomy and lower intelligence as a potential core feature underlying child sexual abuse behavior by pedophiles.", "Reduced autonomic activity is a risk factor for psychopathy, but the mechanisms underlying this association are under-researched. We hypothesize that emotional intelligence mediates this relationship. Emotional intelligence, cognitive intelligence, scores on the Psychopathy Checklist- Revised (PCL-R), skin conductance, and heart rate were assessed in 156 men from communities in Los Angeles. Emotional intelligence fully mediated the relationship between autonomic functioning and total psychopathy after controlling for cognitive intelligence for both autonomic measures. Full mediation was also found when using PCL-R factors and facets as outcome variables, with the exception of a partial mediation of the heart rate - Antisocial facet relationship. These findings are the first to document emotional intelligence as a mediator of the blunted physiological stress activity - psychopathy relationship, and are interpreted within the framework of the somatic marker and somatic aphasia theories of psychopathy. Possible implications for treatment interventions are also discussed.", "An ability to map seizure-generating brain tissue, i.e. the seizure onset zone (SOZ), without recording actual seizures could reduce the duration of invasive EEG monitoring for patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. A widely-adopted practice in the literature is to compare the incidence (events/time) of putative pathological electrophysiological biomarkers associated with epileptic brain tissue with the SOZ determined from spontaneous seizures recorded with intracranial EEG, primarily using a single biomarker. Clinical translation of the previous efforts suffers from their inability to generalize across multiple patients because of (a) the inter-patient variability and (b) the temporal variability in the epileptogenic activity.\nHere, we report an artificial intelligence-based approach for combining multiple interictal electrophysiological biomarkers and their temporal characteristics as a way of accounting for the above barriers and show that it can reliably identify seizure onset zones in a study cohort of 82 patients who underwent evaluation for drug-resistant epilepsy.\nOur investigation provides evidence that utilizing the complementary information provided by multiple electrophysiological biomarkers and their temporal characteristics can significantly improve the localization potential compared to previously published single-biomarker incidence-based approaches, resulting in an average area under ROC curve (AUC) value of 0.73 in a cohort of 82 patients. Our results also suggest that recording durations between 90\u2009min and 2\u2009h are sufficient to localize SOZs with accuracies that may prove clinically relevant.\nThe successful validation of our approach on a large cohort of 82 patients warrants future investigation on the feasibility of utilizing intra-operative EEG monitoring and artificial intelligence to localize epileptogenic brain tissue. Broadly, our study demonstrates the use of artificial intelligence coupled with careful feature engineering in augmenting clinical decision making.", "The aim of the study was to explore the relationship between spirituality/religiousness with cyber bullying and victimization amongst Indian University students and whether emotional intelligence mediates the relationship. Data were collected from 490 University students studying in undergraduate and postgraduate courses across India. IBM AMOS was used to find reliability and validity of instruments and PROCESS macro for IBM SPSS by Preacher and Hayes (Behav Res Methods 36(4): 717-731, 2004) was used for conducting mediation analyses. Both spiritual and existential well-being were found negatively related with cyber bullying and victimization. As far as mediation goes, the negative relationships between spiritual and existential well-being with that of cyber bullying and victimization were significantly mediated by Appraisal of Self-Emotions, Appraisal of Other's Emotions and Regulation and control of Emotions dimensions of emotional intelligence. Implication and future directions are also discussed.", "More than 50% of cancer patients are treated with radiotherapy, either exclusively or in combination with other methods. The planning and delivery of radiotherapy treatment is a complex process, but can now be greatly facilitated by artificial intelligence technology. Deep learning is the fastest-growing field in artificial intelligence and has been successfully used in recent years in many domains, including medicine. In this article, we first explain the concept of deep learning, addressing it in the broader context of machine learning. The most common network architectures are presented, with a more specific focus on convolutional neural networks. We then present a review of the published works on deep learning methods that can be applied to radiotherapy, which are classified into seven categories related to the patient workflow, and can provide some insights of potential future applications. We have attempted to make this paper accessible to both radiotherapy and deep learning communities, and hope that it will inspire new collaborations between these two communities to develop dedicated radiotherapy applications.", "Food insecurity (FI) refers to the lack of sufficient and safe availability of the food. Accumulating studies have suggested associations between dietary intake and Intelligence quotient (IQ). Accordingly, we aimed to examine the association between FI and IQ.\nCase-control study.\nIn this case-control study, 222 girl students aged 9 to 11 years old were randomly chosen from Bandar-Anzali, Iran in 2013. Students with low and moderate IQ were considered as case (n=111) and control (n=111) group, respectively. General and demographic characteristics were collected using interview. United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) household FI questionnaires were also completed. To determine IQ, Wechsler's revised intelligence test was used.\nFI was observed in 51% of study participants. The prevalence of FI in case and control group was 58.6% and 22.5%, respectively. The mean IQ was 77.97 \u00b15.56 in case and 94.6 \u00b15.47 for control group. It was found that there was an inverse association between FI and low IQ. The results of the multiple variable logistic regression analysis (odds ratio and its 95% confidence interval) showed that, FI 3.46 (1.85, 6.50; P>0.001), natural type of delivery 2.45 (1.30, 4.62; P=0.006), and father's low education level 2.97 (1.43, 6.19; P=0.004) were the risky factors leading to low IQ.\nThere was an inverse link between FI and IQ. Therefore, it is necessary to pay more attention to FI and its consequences, particularly in mental health of children.", "The Supplementary Motor Area (SMA)-located in the superior and medial aspects of the superior frontal gyrus-is a preferential site of certain brain tumors and arteriovenous malformations, which often provoke the so-called SMA syndrome. The bulk of the literature studying this syndrome has focused on two of its most apparent symptoms: contralateral motor and speech deficits. Surprisingly, little attention has been given to working memory (WM) even though neuroimaging studies have implicated the SMA in this cognitive process. Given its relevance for higher-order functions, our main goal was to examine whether WM is compromised in SMA lesions. We also asked whether WM deficits might be reducible to processing speed (PS) difficulties. Given the connectivity of the SMA with prefrontal regions related to executive control (EC), as a secondary goal we examined whether SMA lesions also hampered EC. To this end, we tested 12 patients with lesions involving the left (i.e., the dominant) SMA. We also tested 12 healthy controls matched with patients for socio-demographic variables. To ensure that the results of this study can be easily transferred and implemented in clinical practice, we used widely-known clinical neuropsychological tests: WM and PS were measured with their respective Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale indexes, and EC was tested with phonemic and semantic verbal fluency tasks. Non-parametric statistical methods revealed that patients showed deficits in the executive component of WM: they were able to sustain information temporarily but not to mentally manipulate this information. Such WM deficits were not subject to patients' marginal PS impairment. Patients also showed reduced phonemic fluency, which disappeared after controlling for the influence of WM. This observation suggests that SMA damage does not seem to affect cognitive processes engaged by verbal fluency other than WM. In conclusion, WM impairment needs to be considered as part of the SMA syndrome. These findings represent the first evidence about the cognitive consequences (other than language) of damage to the SMA. Further research is needed to establish a more specific profile of WM impairment in SMA patients and determine the consequences of SMA damage for other cognitive functions.", "Excessive fluoride exposure is associated with adverse health outcomes, but little is known of the effects of moderately chronic fluoride exposure on children's health.\nWe conducted a cross-sectional study to explore the health impact of moderately excessive fluoride in drinking water.\nWe recruited 2886 resident children, aged 7 to 13\u202fyears, randomly from endemic and non-endemic fluorosis areas in Tianjin, China. The fluoride levels in drinking water and urine were measured using the national standardized ion selective electrode method. We examined the dose-response effects of low-to-moderate fluoride exposure on dental fluorosis (DF) and intelligence quotient (IQ), and evaluated the potential relationships between DF grades and intelligence levels using piecewise linear regression and multiple logistic regression, respectively.\nThe adjusted odds ratios (ORs) of DF were 2.24 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.02 to 2.48) for every 0.1\u202fmg/L increment in the water fluoride concentration in the range of 0.80 to 1.50\u202fmg/L, and 2.61 (95% CI: 2.32 to 2.93) for every 0.5\u202fmg/L increment in the urinary fluoride level up to 1.80\u202fmg/L. Every 0.5\u202fmg/L increment in the water fluoride level was associated with a reduction of 4.29 in the IQ score (95% CI: -8.09 to -0.48) in the range of 3.40 to 3.90\u202fmg/L, and a decreased probability of developing excellent intelligence (IQ\u202f\u2265\u202f130, OR\u202f=\u202f0.60, 95% CI: 0.47 to 0.77) in the range of 0.20-1.40\u202fmg/L, respectively. Every 0.5\u202fmg/L increment in the urinary fluoride level was related to a decrease of 2.67 in the IQ scores (95% CI: -4.67 to -0.68) between 1.60\u202fmg/L to 2.50\u202fmg/L. Excellent intelligence decreased by 51% in children with higher urinary fluoride, and by 30% with each degree increment of DF.\nOur study suggests threshold and saturation effects of moderately excessive fluoride exposure on DF and intelligence loss in children, and a potential association between DF and the loss of excellent intelligence.", "An ontology of care is a formal, explicit specification of a shared conceptualization. Constructing an ontology is a process that requires four elements: knowledge object, subject that knows, knowledge operation and result. These elements configure theframework to generate ontologies that can be used in Artificial Intelligence systems for care.", "People with schizophrenia often exhibit difficulties to comprehend figurative expressions, such as irony, proverbs, metaphors and idioms, with a general proneness to neglect the figurative meaning and to accept the more literal one. This inability is usually referred to as concretism and it constitutes a clinical manifestation of the broader language dysfunction called Formal Thought Disorder. The current review focuses on the neuropsychological and neuroanatomical underpinnings of schizophrenics' misinterpretation of a subgroup of figurative expressions, i.e., metaphors. Metaphors are heterogeneous in nature, classifiable according to various criteria; for instance, metaphors can be conventional and familiar, or conversely, novel and unusual. These linguistic distinctions are substantial because the comprehension of the different types of metaphor entails partially different cognitive strategies and neural substrates. This review gathers studies that have directly investigated which neurocognitive deficits explain the inefficient comprehension of metaphor in schizophrenia. Several impairments have been put forward, such as general intelligence, executive functions and theory of mind deficits. Moreover, the neural correlates of metaphor comprehension in schizophrenia, like the left inferior/medial frontal gyrus and the temporal lobe, match those cortices affected by the neuropathology of schizophrenia. Even though the causal defective mechanism is still a matter of investigation, we provide an attempt to integrate existing findings.", "Scholars and practitioners advocate evidence-based decision-making (EBDM) because facts lead to beneficial outcomes. At the same time, EBDM to reduce risks in water quality is under-studied. We examine types of decision-making by water utilities and government agencies, and the nature and origin of evidence available to them in their work on delivering safe drinking water to households. Using qualitative content analysis, we comparatively analyze water utilities and government agencies in Malawi, Ecuador, and Brazil. The results show that the water utilities perform combinations of decision-making types on water quality such as implementation, intelligence-gathering, and evaluation and choice, while government agencies perform more intelligence gathering. Sources and types of information are mainly water consumers, guidelines for water quality standards, and self-monitoring from water utilities. The analysis is useful in establishing a foundation for developing evidence-based management within water supply services, and potentially other water resources management activities.", "Over past several years, machine learning, or more generally artificial intelligence, has generated overwhelming research interest and attracted unprecedented public attention. As tomographic imaging researchers, we share the excitement from our imaging perspective [item 1) in the Appendix], and organized this special issue dedicated to the theme of \"Machine learning for image reconstruction.\" This special issue is a sister issue of the special issue published in May 2016 of this journal with the theme \"Deep learning in medical imaging\" [item 2) in the Appendix]. While the previous special issue targeted medical image processing/analysis, this special issue focuses on data-driven tomographic reconstruction. These two special issues are highly complementary, since image reconstruction and image analysis are two of the main pillars for medical imaging. Together we cover the whole workflow of medical imaging: from tomographic raw data/features to reconstructed images and then extracted diagnostic features/readings.", "The ability to act on the world with the goal of gaining information is core to human adaptability and intelligence. Perhaps the most successful and influential account of such abilities is the Optimal Experiment Design (OED) hypothesis, which argues that humans intuitively perform experiments on the world similar to the way an effective scientist plans an experiment. The widespread application of this theory within many areas of psychology calls for a critical evaluation of the theory's core claims. Despite many successes, we argue that the OED hypothesis remains lacking as a theory of human inquiry and that research in the area often fails to confront some of the most interesting and important questions. In this critical review, we raise and discuss nine open questions about the psychology of human inquiry.", "This paper measures the adhesion/cohesion force among asphalt molecules at nanoscale level using an Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) and models the moisture damage by applying state-of-the-art Computational Intelligence (CI) techniques (e.g., artificial neural network (ANN), support vector regression (SVR), and an Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS)). Various combinations of lime and chemicals as well as dry and wet environments are used to produce different asphalt samples. The parameters that were varied to generate different asphalt samples and measure the corresponding adhesion/cohesion forces are percentage of antistripping agents (e.g., Lime and Unichem), AFM tips K values, and AFM tip types. The CI methods are trained to model the adhesion/cohesion forces given the variation in values of the above parameters. To achieve enhanced performance, the statistical methods such as average, weighted average, and regression of the outputs generated by the CI techniques are used. The experimental results show that, of the three individual CI methods, ANN can model moisture damage to lime- and chemically modified asphalt better than the other two CI techniques for both wet and dry conditions. Moreover, the ensemble of CI along with statistical measurement provides better accuracy than any of the individual CI techniques.", "Artificial neural network (ANN) is one of the most widely used methods to develop accurate predictive models based on artificial intelligence and machine learning. In the present study, the important practical aspects of developing a reliable ANN model e.g. appropriate assignment of the number of neurons, number of hidden layers, transfer function, training algorithm, dataset division and initialization of the network are discussed. As a case study, predictability of the flash point for a dataset of 740 organic compounds using ANNs was investigated via a total number of 484220ANNs to allow covering a wide range of parameters affecting the performance of an ANN. Among all studied parameters, the number of neurons or layers was found to be the most important parameters to develop a reliable ANN with low overfitting risk. To evaluate appropriate number of neurons and layers, a value of equal or greater than 10 for the ratio of the training samples to the ANN constants was suggested as a rule of thumb. More ever, a strategy for evaluation of the authentic performance of ANNs and deciding about the reliability of an ANN model was proposed which is applicable to other models developed by supervised learning. Based on the introduced considerations, an ANN model was proposed for predicting the flash point of pure organic compounds. According to the results, the new model was found to produce the lowest error compared to other available models.", "Emotional intelligence can help nurses improve their clients' satisfaction and health. The aim of this hermeneutic phenomenological study was to explore Iranian hospital nurses' lived experiences of emotional intelligence. Data collection was done through holding ten in-depth semi-structured interviews with ten hospital nurses. Participants were recruited from hospitals affiliated with Hamedan University of Medical Sciences, Hamedan, Iran. Data analysis was done using Van Manen's ( 1997 ) six-step approach and resulted in the development of the main theme of normative interactive management and the following three subthemes of resorting to spiritualities, self-protection, and intelligent resilience.", "Video tracking based biological early warning system achieved a great progress with advanced computer vision and machine learning methods. Ability of video tracking of multiple biological organisms has been largely improved in recent years. Video based behavioral monitoring has become a common tool for acquiring quantified behavioral data for aquatic risk assessment. Investigation of behavioral responses under chemical and environmental stress has been boosted by rapidly developed machine learning and artificial intelligence. In this paper, we introduce the fundamental of video tracking and present the pioneer works in precise tracking of a group of individuals in 2D and 3D space. Technical and practical issues suffered in video tracking are explained. Subsequently, the toxic analysis based on fish behavioral data is summarized. Frequently used computational methods and machine learning are explained with their applications in aquatic toxicity detection and abnormal pattern analysis.

The present study addresses some limitations of Carroll's work: specification, reproducibility with more modern methods, and interpretive relevance. We reanalyzed select data sets from Carroll's survey of factor analytic studies using confirmatory factor analysis as well as modern indices of interpretive relevance. For the majority of data sets, we found that Carroll likely extracted too many factors representing Stratum II abilities. Moreover, almost all factors representing Stratum II abilities had little-to-no interpretive relevance above and beyond that of general intelligence. We conclude by discussing the implications of this research with respect to the interpretive relevance and clinical utility of scores reflecting cognitive abilities at all strata of the three-stratum theory and offer some directions for future research. (PsycINFO Database Record", "The relationship between creativity and intelligence has been intensely studied, but still is not clearly understood. Here, we aimed to investigate how creativity and intelligence are related to the different levels of human needs hierarchy. 342 participants completed a battery of instruments for intelligence and creativity as well as inventories for assessing the human needs satisfaction/frustration and self-actualization. We expected that creativity, as a characteristic of a self-actualized person should be related stronger to self-actualization needs, whereas intelligence should be related stronger to satisfaction/frustration, because of its role for humans' adaptation and survival. Results largely confirm expectations: Intelligence is positively related to lower needs, while creativity measures (divergent thinking, creative achievements and activities) show positive associations with higher levels of human needs. These results might contribute to the scientific debate regarding the distinction and the nature of the difference between intelligence and creativity.", "Intelligence is among the key determinants of power and social status in modern societies. In this functional magnetic resonance imaging study, we examined the neural correlates of intelligence evaluation from faces. Participants underwent scans while they evaluated the perceived intelligence and friendliness of faces. We found that medial orbitofrontal cortex activity increased linearly with friendliness ratings. The relationship between perceived intelligence and brain activity was positively linear in the right caudate nucleus and U-shaped (i.e., strong responses to unintelligent-looking or intelligent-looking faces) in the right anterior insula/inferior frontal gyrus. Perceived intelligence was also significantly positively correlated with both friendliness and attractiveness. Furthermore, intelligence rating scores had a positive linear effect on reaction times in the friendliness rating task, suggesting that participants had greater conflicts when making friendliness judgments for faces that appeared to belong to intelligent individuals. In addition, the degree of this effect predicted individual differences in the positive linear modulatory effect of intelligence scores in the right caudate nucleus. Our interpretation was that the activity in the caudate nucleus revealed an approach-avoidance conflict with regard to highly intelligent people, that is, they were perceived as attractive but also potentially threatening. Although our interpretations are merely suggestive because we did not measure the approach-avoidance behaviors directly, our findings have important implications for understanding the dynamics of human interaction in modern societies that increasingly allocate power and status based on intelligence.", "Novel information and communication technologies create possibilities to change the future of health care. Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) is seen as a promising supplement of the current care models. The main goal of AAL solutions is to apply ambient intelligence technologies to enable elderly people to continue to live in their preferred environments. Applying trained models from health data is challenging because the personalized environments could differ significantly than the ones which provided training data. This paper investigates the effects on activity recognition accuracy using single accelerometer of personalized models compared to models built on general population. In addition, we propose a collaborative filtering based approach which provides balance between fully personalized models and generic models. The results show that the accuracy could be improved to 95% with fully personalized models, and up to 91.6% with collaborative filtering based models, which is significantly better than common models that exhibit accuracy of 85.1%. The collaborative filtering approach seems to provide highly personalized models with substantial accuracy, while overcoming the cold start problem that is common for fully personalized models.", "The aim of this work is to extend the research on the relationships between emotional intelligence and various indicators of subjective well-being in adolescents, such as stress and social anxiety. The existence of differences in stress and social anxiety as a function of an emotional intelligence score is also analyzed. A total of 505 Spanish adolescents between the ages of 12 and 18 participated in the study. The results obtained support the existence of a positive relationship between trait emotional intelligence and subjective well-being. Likewise, the existence of a negative association between emotional intelligence and stress, and emotional intelligence and social anxiety, is confirmed. These results are consistent with other similar works based on adolescent samples.", "Objective:To analyze the correlation between obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAHS) and cognitive impairment and functional status after stroke. Method:From February 2014 to September 2016, a total of 189 patients were included in the study, 33 patients with mild OSAHS were excluded, and finally 86 patients in the study group and 70 patients in the control group were included in the final analysis. The main indicators included the cognitive and functional status. Cognitive status was assessed by nine dimensions: vigilance, attention, memory, working memory, executive, language, insight, mental activity, psychomotor, and intelligence. Functional status was assessed using neurological status and functional independence. Secondary measures included sleepiness, fatigue, anxiety and depression, and sleep quality. Result:The age of the study group was higher than the control group, the BMI was higher than the control group, the average hospitalization time was longer than the control group, and all of the difference were statistically significant (all P<0.05). The total cognitive status of the two groups was significantly different, and the total cognitive status study group was significantly worse than in the control group (t=9.276, P=0.012). In the nine dimensions of cognitive ability, the study group's attention, execution, insight, mental adjustment and intelligence were lower than the control group, and the difference was statistically significant (P<0.05). The functional status of the study group was worse than that of the control group (t=38.094, P=0.000). There were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of sleepiness, fatigue, sleep quality, anxiety and depression (P>0.05). Conclusion:The cognitive impairment and functional status of stroke patients with OSAHS are significantly worse. OSAHS is a risk factor for poor prognosis in stroke patients.", "Child abuse and neglect have been associated with cognitive deficits, among other effects on child development. This study explores the prediction that child abuse and neglect has an impact on Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scales 5th Edition (SB5) IQ scores, in relation to gender, age and type of abuse experienced. 300 children with experiences of abuse and neglect were included in the study, comprising 100 sexually abused, 100 physically abused and 100 neglected children. Overall, all scores on the SB5 were found to be significantly lower than the minimum average scores on the test. Verbal IQ (VIQ) scores were likewise found to be significantly lower than Nonverbal IQ (NVIQ) scores. Full Scale IQ (FSIQ) scores did not reveal heterogeneity when gender was factored in. Age and type of abuse (with a moderate effect size) on the other hand, showed significant differences among groups. Statistical analyses of SB5 Factor Index Scores revealed that abused children, in general, have significantly higher Visual-Spatial Processing (VS) and Quantitative Reasoning (QR) scores and lower scores in Knowledge (KN). There was a large effect size found in such an analysis. Age (with a large effect size), gender and type of abuse (with moderate effect sizes) give significant variations to this obtained profile.", "To evaluate the validity of scores from three instruments measuring achievement goal motivation-related constructs: a shortened version of Dweck's Implicit Theories of Intelligence Scale (ITIS-S), measuring incremental and entity mindsets; Elliot's Achievement Goal Questionnaire-Revised (AGQ-R), measuring mastery-approach, mastery-avoidance, performance-approach, and performance-avoidance achievement goals; and Midgley's Patterns of Adaptive Learning Scales (PALS), measuring mastery, performance-approach, and performance-avoidance achievement goals.\nHigh school students participating in a medical simulation training activity in May 2017 completed each instrument. The authors evaluated internal structure using reliability and factor analysis and relations with other variables using the multitrait-multimethod matrix.\nThere were 178 participants. Internal consistency reliability (Cronbach alpha) was > 0.70 for all subscores. Confirmatory factor analysis of ITIS-S scores demonstrated good model fit. Confirmatory factor analysis of AGQ-R scores demonstrated borderline fit; exploratory factor analysis suggested a three-domain model (approach, mastery-avoidance, performance-avoidance). Confirmatory factor analysis of PALS scores also demonstrated borderline fit; exploratory factor analyses suggested consistent distinction between mastery and performance goals but inconsistent distinction between performance-approach and performance-avoidance goals. Correlations among AGQ-R and PALS scores were large for mastery (r = 0.72) and moderate for performance (\u2265 0.45) domains; correlations among incremental and mastery scores were moderate (\u2265 0.34). Contrary to expectations, correlations between entity and performance scores were negligible. Correlations between conceptually unrelated domains were small or negligible.\nAll instrument scores had good internal consistency and generally appropriate relations with other variables, but empirically determined domain structures did not consistently match theory.", "In less than a decade, big data in medicine has become quite a phenomenon and many biomedical disciplines got their own tribune on the topic. Perspectives and debates are flourishing while there is a lack for a consensual definition for big data. The 3Vs paradigm is frequently evoked to define the big data principles and stands for Volume, Variety and Velocity. Even according to this paradigm, genuine big data studies are still scarce in medicine and may not meet\u00a0all expectations. On one hand, techniques usually presented as specific to the big data such as machine learning techniques are supposed to support the ambition of personalized, predictive and preventive medicines. These techniques are mostly far from been new and are more than 50 years old for the most ancient. On the other hand, several issues closely related to the properties of big data and inherited from other scientific fields such as artificial intelligence are often underestimated if not ignored. Besides, a few papers temper the almost unanimous big data enthusiasm and are worth attention since they delineate what is at stakes. In this context, forensic science is still awaiting for its position papers as well as for a comprehensive outline of what kind of contribution big data could bring to the field. The present situation calls for definitions and actions to rationally guide research and practice in big data. It is an opportunity for grounding a true interdisciplinary approach in forensic science and medicine that is mainly based on evidence.", "Concern about increasing carbapenem and piperacillin/tazobactam use led the Scottish Antimicrobial Prescribing Group (SAPG) to develop national guidance on optimal use of these agents, and to implement a quality improvement programme to assess the impact of guidance on practice.\nTo evaluate how SAPG guidance had been implemented by health boards, assess how this translated into clinical practice, and investigate clinicians' views and behaviours about prescribing carbapenems and alternative agents.\nLocal implementation of SAPG guidance was assessed using an online survey. A bespoke point prevalence survey was used to evaluate prescribing. Clinicians' experience of using carbapenems and alternatives was examined through semi-structured interviews. National prescribing data were analysed to assess the impact of the programme.\nThere were greater local restrictions for carbapenems than for piperacillin/tazobactam. Laboratory result suppression was inconsistent between boards and carbapenem-sparing antibiotics were not widely available. Compliance with local guidelines was good for meropenem but lower for piperacillin/tazobactam. Indication for use was well documented but review/stop dates were poorly documented for both antibiotics. Decisions to prescribe a carbapenem were influenced by local guidelines and specialist advice. Many clinicians lacked confidence to de-escalate treatment. Use of both antibiotics decreased during the course of the programme.\nA multifaceted quality improvement programme was used to gather intelligence, promote behaviour change, and focus interventions on the use of carbapenems and piperacillin/tazobactam. Use of these antimicrobials decreased during the programme-a trend not seen elsewhere in Europe. The programme could be generalized to other antimicrobials.", "Ensuring the conditions for all people to be healthy, though always the core mission of public health, has evolved in approaches in response to the changing epidemiology and challenges. In the Public Health 3.0 era, multisectorial efforts are essential in addressing not only infectious or noncommunicable diseases but also upstream social determinants of health. In this article, we argue that actionable, geographically granular, and timely intelligence is an essential infrastructure for the protection of our health today. Even though local and state efforts are key, there are substantial federal roles in accelerating data access, connecting existing data systems, providing guidance, incentivizing nonproprietary analytic tools, and coordinating measures that matter most.", "Whether obesity is associated with childhood cognition is unknown. Given the sensitivity of the developing brain to environmental factors, this study examined whether early-life weight status was associated with children's cognition.\nUsing data from mother-child pairs enrolled in the Health Outcomes and Measures of the Environment (HOME) Study (2003-2006), children's early-life weight status was assessed using weight-for-length/height standard deviation (SD) scores. A battery of neuropsychological tests was administered to assess cognition, executive function, and visual-spatial abilities at ages 5 and 8 years. Using linear mixed models, associations between early-life weight status and cognition were estimated.\nAmong 233 children, 167 were lean (\u22641 SD) and 48 were nonlean (>1 SD). After covariate adjustment, the results suggest that full-scale intelligence quotient scores decreased with a 1-unit increase in weight-for-height SD score (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009-1.4, 95% CI: -3.0 to 0.1). For individual component scores, with a 1-unit increase in weight-for-height SD score, perceptual reasoning (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009-1.7, 95% CI: -3.3 to 0.0) and working memory (\u03b2: -2.4, CI: -4.4 to -0.4) scores decreased. Weight status was generally not associated with other cognition measures.\nWithin this cohort of typically developing children, early-life weight status was inversely associated with children's perceptual reasoning and working memory scores and possibly with full-scale intelligent quotient scores.", "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is the most frequent and severe form of the dystrophinopathies. The literature shows that about 30-40% of DMD subjects have intellectual disability. In males with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, neuropsychiatric disorders have also been observed: attention deficit disorder and hyperactivity, autism spectrum disorders, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Duchenne muscular dystrophy is not just a muscle disorder, but also a disease that affects the brain. The aim of the present study was to describe a case series of children with Duchenne muscular dystrophy that have also the presence of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). They have been assessed by means of standardized autism scales and the most appropriate psycho-educational treatment is herein discussed.\nIn order to evaluate and identify the presence and intensity of autistic symptoms have been used the Childhood Autism Rating Scale and Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule tools. Moreover, in order to assess the intelligence of subjects and their lower limb function, Wisch-R intelligence scale and Vignos function scale were used, respectively.\nAtypical behaviors included a preference for being alone, and selective interest in privileged objects used in a stereotyped manner, motor fretting, and attention instability were present in all children. By the administration of these scales was confirmed the presence of an autism spectrum disorders in all subjects.\nIt is important for clinical practice to consider this association increased.", "While the neuroanatomic substrates of symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) have been investigated, less is known about the neuroanatomic correlates of cognitive abilities pertinent to the disorder, particularly in adults. Here we define the neuroanatomic correlates of key cognitive abilities and determine if there are associations with histories of psychostimulant medication.\nWe acquired neuroanatomic magnetic resonance imaging data from 264 members of 60 families (mean age 29.5; s.d. 18.4, 116 with ADHD). Using linear mixed model regression, we tested for associations between cognitive abilities (working memory, information processing, intelligence, and attention), symptoms and both cortical and subcortical volumes.\nSymptom severity was associated with spatial working memory (t = -3.77, p = 0.0002), processing speed (t = -2.95, p = 0.004) and a measure of impulsive responding (t = 2.19, p = 0.03); these associations did not vary with age (all p &gt; 0.1). Neuroanatomic associations of cognition varied by task but centered on prefrontal, lateral parietal and temporal cortical regions, the thalamus and putamen. The neuroanatomic correlates of ADHD symptoms overlapped significantly with those of working memory (Dice's overlap coefficient: spatial, p = 0.003; verbal, p = 0.001) and information processing (p = 0.02). Psychostimulant medication history was associated with neither cognitive skills nor with a brain-cognition relationships.\nDiagnostic differences in the cognitive profile of ADHD does not vary significantly with age; nor were cognitive differences associated with psychostimulant medication history. The neuroanatomic substrates of working memory and information overlapped with those for symptoms within these extended families, consistent with a pathophysiological role for these cognitive skills in familial ADHD.", "Myotonia congenita (MC) is a non-dystrophic myotonia inherited either in dominant (Thomsen) or recessive (Becker) form. MC is due to an abnormal functioning of skeletal muscle voltage-gated chloride channel (CLCN1), but the genotype/phenotype correlation remains unclear.\nA 48-year-old man, from consanguineous parents, presented with a fixed muscle weakness, muscle atrophy, and a cognitive impairment. Notably, his brother presented the same mutation but with a different phenotype, mainly involving cognitive function.\nThe patient was submitted to cognitive assessment, needle electromyography, brain and muscle MRI, and genetic analysis.\nThe Milan Overall Dementia Assessment showed short-term memory, verbal fluency and verbal intelligence impairment. His genetic analysis showed a recessive splice-site mutation in the CLCN1 gene (IVS19+2T>A). Muscle MRI revealed a symmetric and bilateral fat infiltration of the tensor of fascia lata, gluteus medius, and gluteus maximus muscles, associated to mild atrophy.\nRecessive myotonia congenita was diagnosed.\nFurther studies should establish if and to which extent the CLCN1 mutation is responsible for this c MC phenotype, taking into account a gene-gene and /or a gene-environment.", "The carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) is an important biomarker for cardiovascular diseases and stroke monitoring. This study presents an intelligence-based, novel, robust, and clinically-strong strategy that uses a combination of deep-learning (DL) and machine-learning (ML) paradigms.\nA two-stage DL-based system (a class of AtheroEdge\u2122 systems) was proposed for cIMT measurements. Stage I consisted of a convolution layer-based encoder for feature extraction and a fully convolutional network-based decoder for image segmentation. This stage generated the raw inner lumen borders and raw outer interadventitial borders. To smooth these borders, the DL system used a cascaded stage II that consisted of ML-based regression. The final outputs were the far wall lumen-intima (LI) and media-adventitia (MA) borders which were used for cIMT measurements. There were two sets of gold standards during the DL design, therefore two sets of DL systems (DL1 and DL2) were derived.\nA total of 396\u202fB-mode ultrasound images of the right and left common carotid artery were used from 203 patients (Institutional Review Board approved, Toho University, Japan). For the test set, the cIMT error for the DL1 and DL2 systems with respect to the gold standard was 0.126\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.134 and 0.124\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.100\u202fmm, respectively. The corresponding LI error for the DL1 and DL2 systems was 0.077\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.057 and 0.077\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.049\u202fmm, respectively, while the corresponding MA error for DL1 and DL2 was 0.113\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.105 and 0.109\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.088\u202fmm, respectively. The results showed up to 20% improvement in cIMT readings for the DL system compared to the sonographer's readings. Four statistical tests were conducted to evaluate reliability, stability, and statistical significance.\nThe results showed that the performance of the DL-based approach was superior to the nonintelligence-based conventional methods that use spatial intensities alone. The DL system can be used for stroke risk assessment during routine or clinical trial modes.", "The leadership of an organization requires specific features to adapt to changes and to survive and grow in new environments, and emotional intelligence is one of the most important attributes that can help leaders and managers respond to these changes.\nThis study aimed to determine the relationship between emotional intelligence with administrators' performance at Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.\nThis cross-sectional study was conducted on 100 basic and middle managers of Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran who were selected by census method in 2016. The instrument of data collecting was the \"Inventory Shrinkage\", and the \"Organizational performance evaluation forms\". The data were analyzed by SPSS version 16 using descriptive statistics and Spearman correlation.\nThe results showed there was a significant negative correlation between emotional intelligence and organizational performance in administrators (r=-0.214, p=0.032). The findings also showed that among the components of emotional intelligence and administrators' performance, only components of empathy, was there a significant negative correlation (r=-0.199, p=0.047). Also, there was no statistically significant relationship between emotional intelligence and demographic variables such as work experience, age, marital status and education level (p>0.05). There was no significant relationship between organizational performance and demographic variables, either (p>0.05). But between the components of emotional intelligence, only for social skills and work place of administrators, a significant positive correlation was confirmed (r=0.203, p=0.043).\nThe results of this study showed that there was a negative and significant correlation between the components of emotional intelligence and administrators' performance of Mashhad University of Medical Sciences administrators, only in the empathy component.", "Intelligence was assessed using the Standard Progressive Matrices in 316 MZ and 550 same-sex DZ twins with a mean age of 10 years in Sudan. Heritability was estimated at 0.172 and shared environmental influences at 0.596.", "Chronic pain is associated with school difficulties; however, there is limited published evidence on the cognitive or neuropsychological functioning of youth with chronic pain.\nWhen beginning intensive interdisciplinary pain treatment, 94 youth (age = 10-18) with chronic pain completed neuropsychological assessment (e.g., intelligence, academic skills, learning and recall, and attention) and clinical questionnaires (e.g., pain and physical and psychological functioning). We compared neuropsychological scores with test norms and with clinical questionnaires.\nYouth with chronic pain had higher verbal comprehension and full scale IQ scores than expected, below-average nondominant hand dexterity, and difficulty with visual recall. Self-reported difficulties with executive functioning were associated with small-to-moderate difficulties with objectively measured attention. Performance on neuropsychological measures was generally not associated with pain, impairment, anxiety, or depression, though catastrophizing was negatively correlated with perceptual reasoning. An expected number of these youth had learning disorders (14%); however, more than expected had an autism spectrum disorder (9%) or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (18%), and nearly a quarter demonstrated characteristics of nonverbal learning disability (22%).\nSome of these cognitive findings may be a consequence of chronic pain, and others may reflect subtle neurodevelopmental differences that may predate or be comorbid with pain. Regardless of etiology, with more than half the current sample experiencing some type of learning challenge, often undiagnosed, pediatric psychologists evaluating youth with chronic pain may wish to screen for comorbid learning difficulties.", "Purpose To compare peripheral nervous system function and balance between adult survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and matched controls and to determine associations between peripheral neuropathy (PN) and limitations in static balance, mobility, walking endurance, and quality of life (QoL) among survivors. Patients and Methods Three hundred sixty-five adult survivors of childhood ALL and 365 controls with no cancer history completed assessments of PN (modified Total Neuropathy Score [mTNS]), static balance (Sensory Organization Test [SOT]), mobility (Timed Up and Go), walking endurance (6-minute walk test), QoL (Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form Survey), and visual-motor processing speed (Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale). Results PN, but not impairments, in performance on SOT was more common in survivors than controls (41.4% v 9.5%, respectively; P < .001). In multivariable models, higher mTNS scores were associated with longer time to complete the Timed Up and Go (\u03b2 = 0.15; 95% CI, 0.06 to 0.23; P < .001), shorter distance walked in 6 minutes (\u03b2 = -4.39; 95% CI, -8.63 to -0.14; P = .04), and reduced QoL (\u03b2 = -1.33; 95% CI, -1.79 to -0.87; P < .001 for physical functioning; \u03b2 = -1.16; 95% CI, -1.64 to -0.67; P < .001 for role physical; and \u03b2 = -0.88; 95% CI, -1.34 to -0.42; P < .001 for general health). Processing speed (\u03b2 = 1.69; 95% CI, 0.98 to 2.40; P < .001), but not mTNS score, was associated with anterior-posterior sway on the SOT. Conclusion PN in long-term ALL survivors is associated with movement, including mobility and walking endurance, but not with static standing balance. The association between processing speed and sway suggests that static balance impairment in ALL survivors may be influenced by problems with CNS function, including the processing of sensory information.", "Electroencephalography (EEG) was introduced into anesthesia practice in the 1990s as a tool to titrate anesthetic depth. However, limitations in current analysis techniques have called into question whether these techniques improve standard of care, or instead call for improved, more ubiquitously applicable measures to assess anesthetic transitions and depth. This review highlights emerging analytical approaches and techniques from neuroscience research that have the potential to better capture anesthetic transitions to provide better measurements of anesthetic depth.\nSince the introduction of electroencephalography, neuroscientists, engineers, mathematicians, and clinicians have all been developing new ways of analyzing continuous electrical signals. Collaborations between these fields have proliferated several analytical techniques that demonstrate how anesthetics affect brain dynamics and conscious transitions. Here, we review techniques in the following categories: network science, integration and information, nonlinear dynamics, and artificial intelligence.\nUp-and-coming techniques have the potential to better clinically define and characterize altered consciousness time points. Such new techniques used alongside traditional measures have the potential to improve depth of anesthesia measurements and enhance an understanding of how the brain is affected by anesthetic agents. However, new measures will be needed to be tested for robustness in real-world environments and on diverse experimental protocols.", "A growing body of research has examined whether people's judgments of their own memory functioning accurately reflect their memory performance at cross-section and over time. Relatively less is known about whether these judgments are specifically based on memory performance, or reflect general cognitive change. The aim of the present study was to examine longitudinal associations of subjective memory with performance in tests of episodic memory and a wide range of other cognitive tests, including the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised (WAIS-R) Block Design, Comprehension, Digit Span, Digit Symbol, and Vocabulary subtests. We applied latent growth curve models to five occasions over up to 16 years of neuropsychological assessments from 956 participants of the Seattle Longitudinal Study (SLS; 57% women; age at baseline: M = 65.1, SD = 11.4, 38 - 96 years). Results revealed that lower self-reported Frequency of Forgetting was significantly associated with better performance in all cognitive domains at baseline. The baseline correlation of Frequency of Forgetting with memory performance was stronger than its correlations with performance in other cognitive tests. Furthermore, additional analyses with baseline data showed that a latent memory performance factor reliably predicted Frequency of Forgetting after controlling for a general cognitive factor. Over time, steeper increases in Frequency of Forgetting were associated with steeper declines in tests of memory performance and in the Block Design and Digit Symbol subtests. Taken together, these findings suggest that although self-reported Frequency of Forgetting reflects performance in a broad range of other cognitive domains, it also shows some specificity for memory performance. (PsycINFO Database Record", "Studies have found a higher risk of burnout among employees in the healthcare sector. As such, this study focused on Certified Nursing Aides (CNAs) who have shown a high prevalence of burnout and are therefore considered an especially vulnerable group. The objective of this study was to identify the relationships between some organizational, personal, and sociodemographic factors and burnout. The final study sample included 278 working CNAs with a mean age of 40.88 (SD = 9.41). To compile the data, an ad hoc questionnaire was used to collect sociodemographic information. To collect professional and employment information, we used the Brief Emotional Intelligence Inventory for Adults, the Brief Questionnaire on Perceived Social Support, and the General Self-Efficacy Scale. The results showed that Burnout Syndrome is significantly and negatively related to all the emotional intelligence factors, self-efficacy, and perceived social support. The risk of burnout is higher in younger persons and in permanently employed professionals. General self-efficacy and stress management act as protective factors against the likelihood of burnout. This study suggests that organizations should urge coaching and transformational leadership training programs to promote the wellbeing and organizational commitment of workers.", "Flying ad-hoc networks (FANETs) are a very vibrant research area nowadays. They have many military and civil applications. Limited battery energy and the high mobility of micro unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) represent their two main problems, i.e., short flight time and inefficient routing. In this paper, we try to address both of these problems by means of efficient clustering. First, we adjust the transmission power of the UAVs by anticipating their operational requirements. Optimal transmission range will have minimum packet loss ratio (PLR) and better link quality, which ultimately save the energy consumed during communication. Second, we use a variant of the K-Means Density clustering algorithm for selection of cluster heads. Optimal cluster heads enhance the cluster lifetime and reduce the routing overhead. The proposed model outperforms the state of the art artificial intelligence techniques such as Ant Colony Optimization-based clustering algorithm and Grey Wolf Optimization-based clustering algorithm. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated in term of number of clusters, cluster building time, cluster lifetime and energy consumption.", "We recently demonstrated the acceptability and feasibility of a randomized, double-blind choline supplementation intervention for heavy drinking women during pregnancy. In this study, we report our results relating to the efficacy of this intervention in mitigating adverse effects of prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) on infant growth and cognitive function.\nSixty-nine Cape Coloured (mixed ancestry) heavy drinkers in Cape Town, South Africa, recruited in mid-pregnancy, were randomly assigned to receive a daily oral dose of either 2\u00a0g of choline or placebo from time of enrollment until delivery. Each dose consisted of an individually wrapped packet of powder that, when mixed with water, produced a sweet tasting grape-flavored drink. The primary outcome, eyeblink conditioning (EBC), was assessed at 6.5\u00a0months. Somatic growth was measured at birth, 6.5, and 12\u00a0months, recognition memory and processing speed on the Fagan Test of Infant Intelligence, at 6.5 and 12\u00a0months.\nInfants born to choline-treated mothers were more likely to meet criterion for conditioning on EBC than the placebo group. Moreover, within the choline arm, degree of maternal adherence to the supplementation protocol strongly predicted EBC performance. Both groups were small at birth, but choline-treated infants showed considerable catch-up growth in weight and head circumference at 6.5 and 12\u00a0months. At 12\u00a0months, the infants in the choline treatment arm had higher novelty preference scores, indicating better visual recognition memory.\nThis exploratory study is the first to provide evidence that a high dose of choline administered early in pregnancy can mitigate adverse effects of heavy PAE on EBC, postnatal growth, and cognition in human infants. These findings are consistent with studies of alcohol-exposed animals that have demonstrated beneficial effects of choline supplementation on classical conditioning, learning, and memory.", "Rare neurodevelopmental syndromes often present social cognitive deficits that may underlie difficulties in social interactions and increase the risk of psychosis or autism spectrum disorders. However, little is known regarding the specificities of social cognitive impairment across syndromes while it remains a major challenge for the care. Our review provides an overview of social cognitive dysfunctions in rare diseases associated with psychiatric symptoms (with a prevalence estimated between 1 in 1,200 and 1 in 25,000 live births: 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, Angelman syndrome, Fragile X syndrome, Klinefelter syndrome, Prader-Willi syndrome, Rett syndrome, Smith-Magenis syndrome, Turner syndrome, and Williams syndrome) and shed some light on the specific mechanisms that may underlie these skills in each clinical presentation. We first detail the different processes included in the generic expression \"social cognition\" before summarizing the genotype, psychiatric phenotype, and non-social cognitive profile in each syndrome. Then, we offer a systematic review of the social cognitive abilities and the disturbed mechanisms they are likely associated with. We followed the PRISMA process, including the definition of the relevant search terms, the selection of studies based on clear inclusion, and exclusion criteria and the quality appraisal of papers. We finally provide insights that may have considerable influence on the development of adapted therapeutic interventions such as social cognitive training (SCT) therapies specifically designed to target the psychiatric phenotype. The results of this review suggest that social cognition impairments share some similarities across syndromes. We propose that social cognitive impairments are strongly involved in behavioral symptoms regardless of the overall cognitive level measured by intelligence quotient. Better understanding the mechanisms underlying impaired social cognition may lead to adapt therapeutic interventions. The studies targeting social cognition processes offer new thoughts about the development of specific cognitive training programs, as they highlight the importance of connecting neurocognitive and SCT techniques.", "In this exploratory study, we investigated whether and to what extent individual differences in cognitive and personality variables are associated with spoken idiom comprehension in context. Language unimpaired participants were enrolled in a cross-modal lexical decision study in which semantically ambiguous Italian idioms (i.e., strings with both a literal and an idiomatic interpretation as, for instance, break the ice), predictable or unpredictable before the string offset, were embedded in idiom-biasing contexts. To explore the contributions of different cognitive and personality components, participants also completed a series of tests respectively assessing general speed, inhibitory control, short-term and working memory, cognitive flexibility, crystallized and fluid intelligence, and personality. Stepwise regression analyses revealed that online idiom comprehension was associated with the participants' working memory, inhibitory control and crystallized verbal intelligence, an association modulated by idiom type. Also personality-related variables (State Anxiety and Openness to Experience) were associated with idiom comprehension, although in marginally significant ways. These results contribute to the renewed interest on how individual variability modulates language comprehension, and for the first time document contributions of individual variability on lexicalized, high frequency multi-word expressions as idioms adding new knowledge to the existing evidence on metaphor and sarcasm.", "The aim of this study is to determine impairments of certain cognitive functions in certain vascular cognitive syndromes and to identify predictors of dementia.\nOne-year prospective study included 275 patients, who were hospitalized at the Department of Neurology Tuzla and therefore fulfilled certain criteria. Patients were divided into following subgroups of vascular cognitive impairment (VCI): dementia of strategic infarct (DSI), cortical dementia (CD), sub cortical dementia (SCD), hemorrhagic dementia (HD), and patients without dementia. Each of the patients underwent the clinical examination and scoring with appropriate measurement scales.\nSome of the types of VCI were verified in 190 (69%) patients, and the most common was SCD (58%). There was statistically significant connection between the level of intelligence and occurrence of VCI in patients after stroke (p\u2009<\u20090.001). We found significant connection between occurrence of dementia and impairment in narrative memory, numerical memory, visual perceptive, and visual constructive functions in patients with dementia compared with non-demented (p\u2009=\u20090.0001). The executive functions were statistically impaired in patients with CD (p\u2009=\u20090.004) and SCD (p\u2009<\u20090.001). Patients without dementia have significantly better quality of life than the demented ones (p\u2009<\u20090.0001). The algorithm \"tree of decision\" can help us in the prediction of dementia based on the impairment of certain cognitive functions.\nVascular cognitive syndromes are common after stroke. Some of the cognitive functions are significantly impaired in patients with dementia. Impairment of the certain cognitive functions can help in predicting the onset of dementia. Patients without dementia have better quality of life.", "Fluoride, one of the most celebrated ingredients for the prevention of dental caries in the 20th century, has also been controversial for its use in dentifrices and other applications. In the current review, we have concentrated primarily on early-life exposure to fluoride and how it may affect the various organs. The most recent controversial aspects of fluoride are related to toxicity of the developing brain and how it may possibly result in the decrease of intelligence quotient (IQ), autism, and calcification of the pineal gland. In addition, it has been reported to have possible effects on bone and thyroid glands. If nutritional stress is applied during a critical period of growth and development, the organ(s) and/or body will never recover once they pass through the critical period. For example, if animals are force-fed during experiments, they will simply get fat but never reach the normal size. Although early-life fluoride exposure causing fluorosis is well reported in the literature, the dental profession considers it primarily as an esthetic rather than a serious systemic problem. In the current review, we wanted to raise the possibility of future disease as a result of early-life exposure to fluoride. It is not currently known how fluoride will become a cause of future disease. Studies of other nutritional factors have shown that the effects of early nutritional stress are a cause of disease in later life.", "A trainer for online laparoscopic surgical skills assessment based on the performance of experts and nonexperts is presented. The system uses computer vision, augmented reality, and artificial intelligence algorithms, implemented into a Raspberry Pi board with Python programming language.\nTwo training tasks were evaluated by the laparoscopic system: transferring and pattern cutting. Computer vision libraries were used to obtain the number of transferred points and simulated pattern cutting trace by means of tracking of the laparoscopic instrument. An artificial neural network (ANN) was trained to learn from experts and nonexperts' behavior for pattern cutting task, whereas the assessment of transferring task was performed using a preestablished threshold. Four expert surgeons in laparoscopic surgery, from hospital \"Raymundo Abarca Alarc\u00f3n,\" constituted the experienced class for the ANN. Sixteen trainees (10 medical students and 6 residents) without laparoscopic surgical skills and limited experience in minimal invasive techniques from School of Medicine at Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Guerrero constituted the nonexperienced class. Data from participants performing 5 daily repetitions for each task during 5 days were used to build the ANN.\nThe participants tend to improve their learning curve and dexterity with this laparoscopic training system. The classifier shows mean accuracy and receiver operating characteristic curve of 90.98% and 0.93, respectively. Moreover, the ANN was able to evaluate the psychomotor skills of users into 2 classes: experienced or nonexperienced.\nWe constructed and evaluated an affordable laparoscopic trainer system using computer vision, augmented reality, and an artificial intelligence algorithm. The proposed trainer has the potential to increase the self-confidence of trainees and to be applied to programs with limited resources.", "Why do some people struggle with self-control (colloquially called willpower) whereas others are able to sustain it during challenging circumstances? Recent research showed that a person's implicit theories of willpower-whether they think self-control capacity is a limited or nonlimited resource-predict sustained self-control on laboratory tasks and on goal-related outcomes in everyday life. The present research tests the Implicit Theory of Willpower for Strenuous Mental Activities Scale (or ITW-M) Scale for measurement invariance across samples and gender within each culture, and two cultural contexts (the U.S. and Switzerland/Germany). Across a series of multigroup confirmatory factor analyses, we found support for the measurement invariance of the ITW-M scale across samples within and across two cultures, as well as across men and women. Further, the analyses showed expected patterns of convergent (with life-satisfaction and trait-self-control) and discriminant validity (with implicit theory of intelligence). These results provide guidelines for future research and clinical practice using the ITW-M scale for the investigation of latent group differences, for example, between gender or cultures.

These have generated novel opportunities for development of dedicated data-intensive machine learning techniques. In particular, recent research in deep learning (DL), reinforcement learning (RL), and their combination (deep RL) promise to revolutionize the future of artificial intelligence. The growth in computational power accompanied by faster and increased data storage, and declining computing costs have already allowed scientists in various fields to apply these techniques on data sets that were previously intractable owing to their size and complexity. This paper provides a comprehensive survey on the application of DL, RL, and deep RL techniques in mining biological data. In addition, we compare the performances of DL techniques when applied to different data sets across various application domains. Finally, we outline open issues in this challenging research area and discuss future development perspectives.", "There is growing interest in utilizing artificial intelligence, and particularly deep learning, for computer vision in histopathology. While accumulating studies highlight expert-level performance of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on focused classification tasks, most studies rely on probability distribution scores with empirically defined cutoff values based on post-hoc analysis. More generalizable tools that allow humans to visualize histology-based deep learning inferences and decision making are scarce.\nHere, we leverage t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) to reduce dimensionality and depict how CNNs organize histomorphologic information. Unique to our workflow, we develop a quantitative and transparent approach to visualizing classification decisions prior to softmax compression. By discretizing the relationships between classes on the t-SNE plot, we show we can super-impose randomly sampled regions of test images and use their distribution to render statistically-driven classifications. Therefore, in addition to providing intuitive outputs for human review, this visual approach can carry out automated and objective multi-class classifications similar to more traditional and less-transparent categorical probability distribution scores. Importantly, this novel classification approach is driven by a priori statistically defined cutoffs. It therefore serves as a generalizable classification and anomaly detection tool less reliant on post-hoc tuning.\nRoutine incorporation of this convenient approach for quantitative visualization and error reduction in histopathology aims to accelerate early adoption of CNNs into generalized real-world applications where unanticipated and previously untrained classes are often encountered.", "Neurofibromatosis type 1 is a genetic disorder associated with cognitive deficits, learning disabilities and behavioral problems. These domains appear to have a still controversial debated association with local areas of T2-hyperintensities on MRI images, called unidentified bright objects (UBOs).\nA cohort of 36 children (aged 7-11 years) included consecutively, underwent neuropsychological and behavioral assessment to determine their cognitive and neuropsychological profile, and the frequency of specific learning disabilities. MRI examination was used to determine the impact of UBOs' presence, number, and location on the cognitive, neuropsychological and behavioral profile, and also the presence of optic glioma.\nThe mean full intelligence quotient was 104.6; only one child had mild intellectual disability. Forty one percent of children had a diagnosis of specific learning disabilities and reading was mainly involved. Twenty per cent had attention problems. All children had normal scores in visuo-motor and visuo-perceptual tests. UBOs were present in 94.0% of the MRI examinations. Two children had optic glioma. Children with UBOs in a specific location and children with UBOs elsewhere were statistically compared, no one of the location seemed to have an impact on general cognition measured with full intelligence quotient. The thalamus was associated with problems in calculation and striatum with behavioral problems. An inverse relationship between the number of UBOs and the full intelligence quotient was present, but without a statistical significance.\nIn this study, the specific location of UBOs did not seem to influence the general cognitive profile and also the relationship between their number and the full intelligence quotient was not significant; these results are still controversial in literature. Finally, the presence of UBOs in the thalamus and striatum may represent a neuroradiological pattern that influences performances in calculation and behavior respectively in children with Neurofibromatosis type 1.", "This one-year longitudinal study examined the developmental trajectories of English reading in Chinese children learning English as a second language (ESL) and identified cognitive profiles of children who are at risk for English reading disability. One hundred and eighty-four Chinese ESL children from eight Hong Kong kindergartens were measured four times during their last year of kindergarten for phonological awareness, letter knowledge, vocabulary and English word reading. Growth mixture modeling was applied to classify the children based on their growth trajectories in English word reading. Four subgroups of word reading growth were classified, namely high-achieving, fast-growth, slow-growth and low-achieving groups. The cognitive-linguistic skills were compared across different groups with age, non-verbal intelligence and receptive vocabulary in L1 controlled. The results showed that low-achieving groups, who were expected to be at-risk for L2 reading disability, showed deficits in letter-name knowledge, phonemic awareness, and receptive and expressive vocabulary. Fast-growth and high-achieving groups were not distinguishable on the measured cognitive-linguistic skills. Children in the low-growth groups were significantly weaker in phonemic awareness, receptive vocabulary and expressive vocabulary than children in the high-achieving group. Our findings identified specific cognitive-linguistic deficits that were associated with children who are at-risk for reading disability. Implications for the early identification of L2 reading disability were discussed.", "A cochlear implant is a device that helps hearing-impaired children by transmitting sound signals to the brain and helping them improve their speech, language, and social interaction. Although various studies have investigated the different aspects of speech perception and language acquisition in cochlear-implanted children, little is known about their social skills, particularly Persian-speaking cochlear-implanted children. Considering the growing number of cochlear implants being performed in Iran and the increasing importance of developing near-normal social skills as one of the ultimate goals of cochlear implantation, this study was performed to compare the social interaction between Iranian cochlear-implanted children who have undergone rehabilitation (auditory verbal therapy) after surgery and normal-hearing children.\nThis descriptive-analytical study compared the social interaction level of 30 children with normal hearing and 30 with cochlear implants who were conveniently selected. The Raven test was administered to the both groups to ensure normal intelligence quotient. The social interaction status of both groups was evaluated using the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale, and statistical analysis was performed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 21.\nAfter controlling age as a covariate variable, no significant difference was observed between the social interaction scores of both the groups (p > 0.05). In addition, social interaction had no correlation with sex in either group.\nCochlear implantation followed by auditory verbal rehabilitation helps children with sensorineural hearing loss to have normal social interactions, regardless of their sex.", "The issue of financial distress prediction plays an important and challenging research topic in the financial field. Currently, there have been many methods for predicting firm bankruptcy and financial crisis, including the artificial intelligence and the traditional statistical methods, and the past studies have shown that the prediction result of the artificial intelligence method is better than the traditional statistical method. Financial statements are quarterly reports; hence, the financial crisis of companies is seasonal time-series data, and the attribute data affecting the financial distress of companies is nonlinear and nonstationary time-series data with fluctuations. Therefore, this study employed the nonlinear attribute selection method to build a nonlinear financial distress prediction model: that is, this paper proposed a novel seasonal time-series gene expression programming model for predicting the financial distress of companies. The proposed model has several advantages including the following: (i) the proposed model is different from the previous models lacking the concept of time series; (ii) the proposed integrated attribute selection method can find the core attributes and reduce high dimensional data; and (iii) the proposed model can generate the rules and mathematical formulas of financial distress for providing references to the investors and decision makers. The result shows that the proposed method is better than the listing classifiers under three criteria; hence, the proposed model has competitive advantages in predicting the financial distress of companies.", "Recent work has begun to focus on the role that individual differences in executive function and intelligence have on the production of fluent speech. However, isolating the underlying causes of different types of disfluency has been difficult given the speed and complexity of language production. In this study, we focused on the role of memory abilities and verbal intelligence, and we chose a task that relied heavily on memory for successful performance. Given the task demands, we hypothesised that a substantial proportion of disfluencies would be due to memory retrieval problems. We contrasted memory abilities with individual differences in verbal intelligence as previous work highlighted verbal intelligence as an important factor in disfluency production. A total of 78 participants memorised and repeated 40 syntactically complex sentences, which were recorded and coded for disfluencies. Model comparisons were carried out using hierarchical structural equation modelling. Results showed that repetitions were significantly related to verbal intelligence. Unfilled pauses and repairs, in contrast, were marginally ( p\u2009<\u2009.09) related to memory abilities. The relationship in all cases was negative. Conclusions explore the link between different types of disfluency and particular problems arising in the course of production, and how individual differences inform theoretical debates in language production.", "The fast and affordable sequencing of large clinical and environmental metagenomic datasets opens up new horizons in medical and biotechnological applications. It is believed that today we have described only about 1% of the microorganisms on the Earth, therefore, metagenomic analysis mostly deals with unknown species in the samples. Microbial communities in extreme environments may contain genes with high biotechnological potential, and clinical metagenomes, related to diseases, may uncover still unknown pathogens and pathological mechanisms in known diseases. While the species-level identification and description of the taxa in the samples do not seem to be possible today, we can search for novel genes with known functions in these samples, using numerous techniques, including artificial intelligence tools, like the hidden Markov models (HMMs). Here we describe a simple-to-use webserver, the MetaHMM, which is capable of homology-based automatic model-building for the genes to be searched for, and it also finds the closest matches in the metagenome. The webserver uses already highly successful building blocks: it performs multiple alignments by applying Clustal Omega, builds a hidden Markov model with HMMER components of hmmbuild and uses hmmsearch for finding similar sequences to the specified model in the metagenomes. The webserver is publicly available at https://metahmm.pitgroup.org.", "The rising prevalence of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) increases the need for evidence-based behavioral treatments to lessen the impact of symptoms on children's functioning. At present, there are no curative or psychopharmacological therapies to effectively treat all symptoms of the disorders. Early intensive behavioral intervention (EIBI) is a treatment based on the principles of applied behavior analysis. Delivered for multiple years at an intensity of 20 to 40 hours per week, it is one of the more well-established treatments for ASD. This is an update of a Cochrane review last published in 2012.\nTo systematically review the evidence for the effectiveness of EIBI in increasing functional behaviors and skills, decreasing autism severity, and improving intelligence and communication skills for young children with ASD.\nWe searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, 12 additional electronic databases and two trials registers in August 2017. We also checked references and contacted study authors to identify additional studies.\nRandomized control trials (RCTs), quasi-RCTs, and controlled clinical trials (CCTs) in which EIBI was compared to a no-treatment or treatment-as-usual control condition. Participants must have been less than six years of age at treatment onset and assigned to their study condition prior to commencing treatment.\nWe used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.We synthesized the results of the five studies using a random-effects model of meta-analysis, with a mean difference (MD) effect size for outcomes assessed on identical scales, and a standardized mean difference (SMD) effect size (Hedges' g) with small sample correction for outcomes measured on different scales. We rated the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach.\nWe included five studies (one RCT and four CCTs) with a total of 219 children: 116 children in the EIBI groups and 103 children in the generic, special education services groups. The age of the children ranged between 30.2 months and 42.5 months. Three of the five studies were conducted in the USA and two in the UK, with a treatment duration of 24 months to 36 months. All studies used a treatment-as-usual comparison group.Primary outcomesThere is low quality-evidence at post-treatment that EIBI improves adaptive behaviour (MD 9.58 (assessed using Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale (VABS) Composite; normative mean = 100, normative SD = 15), 95% confidence interval (CI) 5.57 to 13.60, P < 0.0001; 5 studies, 202 participants), and reduces autism symptom severity (SMD -0.34, 95% CI -0.79 to 0.11, P = 0.14; 2 studies, 81 participants; lower values indicate positive effects) compared to treatment as usual.No adverse effects were reported across studies.Secondary outcomesThere is low-quality evidence at post-treatment that EIBI improves IQ (MD 15.44 (assessed using standardized IQ tests; scale 0 to 100, normative SD = 15), 95% CI 9.29 to 21.59, P < 0.001; 5 studies, 202 participants); expressive (SMD 0.51, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.90, P = 0.01; 4 studies, 165 participants) and receptive (SMD 0.55, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.87, P = 0.001; 4 studies, 164 participants) language skills; and problem behaviour (SMD -0.58, 95% CI -1.24 to 0.07, P = 0.08; 2 studies, 67 participants) compared to treatment as usual.\nThere is weak evidence that EIBI may be an effective behavioral treatment for some children with ASD; the strength of the evidence in this review is limited because it mostly comes from small studies that are not of the optimum design. Due to the inclusion of non-randomized studies, there is a high risk of bias and we rated the overall quality of evidence as 'low' or 'very low' using the GRADE system, meaning further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate.It is important that providers of EIBI are aware of the current evidence and use clinical decision-making guidelines, such as seeking the family's input and drawing upon prior clinical experience, when making recommendations to clients on the use EIBI. Additional studies using rigorous research designs are needed to make stronger conclusions about the effects of EIBI for children with ASD.", "To explore the heterogeneity of Tourette syndrome as part of a neurodevelopmental spectrum.\nUsing hierarchical ascendant clustering based on tic symptoms, developmental milestones, and neurodevelopmental comorbidities, we analyzed the heterogeneity of Tourette syndrome phenotypes in a sample of 174 children and adolescents with Tourette syndrome referred to a tertiary university clinic.\nThe model yielded three distinct clusters characterized as follows. In cluster 1, we found many neurodevelopmental comorbidities (including intellectual disabilities, autism spectrum disorder, attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder [ADHD], and learning disabilities) and academic impairments. In cluster 2, patients had no other neurodevelopmental comorbidities. In cluster 3, patients had higher intelligence, a high frequency of attentional impairment, school problems related to both ADHD and unspecific attention difficulties, and handwriting problems related to the tics themselves. Interestingly, clusters did not differ in terms of family history or anxious-depressive comorbidities. The only other differences that emerged were related to prenatal or perinatal risk factors (more represented in cluster 1) and treatment profiles (higher rates of stimulants in cluster 1).\nWe conclude that from a phenotypical perspective, Tourette syndrome is a heterogeneous syndrome with at least three main clusters that may help in addressing the etiological basis of Tourette syndrome and specific rehabilitative and therapeutic approaches.\nThe clustering of Tourette syndrome based on comorbidity with other neurodevelopmental conditions reveals three clusters. A group of patients with Tourette syndrome show school difficulties related to non-specific attention and writing problems. Analysing only children and adolescents helps to distinguish between developmental comorbid conditions and coexistent disorders.", "Motor outcomes of children with unilateral cerebral palsy are clearly documented and well understood, yet few studies describe the cognitive functioning in this population, and the associations between the two is poorly understood. Using two hands together in daily life involves complex motor and cognitive processes. Impairment in either domain may contribute to difficulties with bimanual performance. Research is yet to derive whether, and how, cognition affects a child's ability to use their two hands to perform bimanual tasks.\nThis study will use a prospective, cross-sectional multi-centre observational design. Children (aged 6-12\u00a0years) with unilateral cerebral palsy will be recruited from one of five Australian treatment centres. We will examine associations between cognition, bimanual performance and brain neuropathology (lesion type and severity) in a sample of 131 children. The primary outcomes are: Motor - the Assisting Hand Assessment; Cognitive - Executive Function; and Brain - lesion location on structural MRI. Secondary data collected will include: Motor - Box and Blocks, ABILHAND- Kids, Sword Test; Cognitive - standard neuropsychological measures of intelligence. We will use generalized linear modelling and structural equation modelling techniques to investigate relationships between bimanual performance, executive function and brain lesion location.\nThis large multi-centre study will examine how cognition affects bimanual performance in children with unilateral cerebral palsy. First, it is anticipated that distinct relationships between bimanual performance and cognition (executive function) will be identified. Second, it is anticipated that interrelationships between bimanual performance and cognition will be associated with common underlying neuropathology. Findings have the potential to improve the specificity of existing upper limb interventions by providing more targeted treatments and influence the development of novel methods to improve both cognitive and motor outcomes in children with unilateral cerebral palsy.\nACTRN12614000631606 ; Date of retrospective registration 29/05/2014.", "The 24th Annual Prostate Cancer Foundation (PCF) Scientific Retreat was held from October 5-7, 2017, at the Omni Shoreham Hotel in Washington, DC.\nThe PCF Scientific Retreat is a scientific conference that specifically focuses on cutting edge research deemed to have significant promise for accelerating advances in prostate cancer biology and treatment.\nThemes highlighted at this year's meeting included: (i) new understandings in prostate cancer biology and disease progression; (ii) new mechanisms and treatment targets in advanced prostate cancer; (iii) advances in precision medicine genomics, germline genetics, and selection of targeted therapies; (iv) PSMA-targeted agents for PET imaging and radionuclide therapy; (v) approaches for improving the efficacy of immunotherapy in prostate cancer; (vi) applications of 3D Genomics in prostate cancer research; and (vii) potential applications of artificial intelligence in prostate cancer.\nThis article reviews the research presented at the PCF Scientific Retreat, in order to improve understanding of the current state of prostate cancer research, encourage discourse and exchange of novel ideas, and stimulate new basic, translational, and clinical research that will ultimately improve the lives of patients.", "Adverse effects of severe maternal iodine deficiency in pregnancy on fetal brain development are well-established, but the effects of milder deficiency are uncertain. Most studies examine iodine status in pregnancy; less is known about iodine nutrition before conception.\nWe examined relations between maternal preconception iodine status and offspring cognitive function, within a prospective mother-offspring cohort.\nMaternal iodine status was assessed through the use of the ratio of iodine:creatinine concentrations (I/Cr) in spot urine samples [median (IQR) period before conception 3.3 y (2.2-4.7 y)]. Childhood cognitive function was assessed at age 6-7 y. Full-scale IQ was assessed via the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence, and executive function through the use of tests from the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB). Analyses (n\u00a0=\u00a0654 mother-child dyads) were adjusted for potential confounders including maternal intelligence, education, and breastfeeding duration.\nThe median (IQR) urinary iodine concentration was 108.4 \u00b5g/L (62.2-167.8 \u00b5g/L) and the I/Cr ratio 114 \u00b5g/g (76-164 \u00b5g/g). The preconception I/Cr ratio was positively associated with child IQ, before and after adjustment for potential confounding influences [\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.13 (95% CI: 0.04, 0.21)/SD, P\u00a0=\u00a00.003]. 8.9% of women had a preconception urinary I/Cr ratio <50 \u00b5g/g; compared with those with an I/Cr ratio \u2265150 \u00b5g/g, the IQ of their offspring was 0.49 (95% CI: 0.79, 0.18) SD lower. There were no associations with the executive function outcomes assessed via CANTAB, before or after adjustment for confounders.\nThe positive association between iodine status before conception and child IQ provides some support for demonstrated links between low maternal iodine status in pregnancy and poorer cognitive function reported in other studies. However, given the negative effects on school performance previously observed in children born to iodine-deficient mothers, the lack of associations with measures of executive function in the present study was unexpected. Further data are needed to establish the public health importance of low preconception iodine status.", "Flow cytometry analysis is the method of choice for the differential diagnosis of hematologic disorders. It is typically performed by a trained hematopathologist through visual examination of bidimensional plots, making the analysis time-consuming and sometimes too subjective. Here, a pilot study applying genetic algorithms to flow cytometry data from normal and acute myeloid leukemia subjects is described.\nInitially, Flow Cytometry Standard files from 316 normal and 43 acute myeloid leukemia subjects were transformed into multidimensional FITS image metafiles. Training was performed through introduction of FITS metafiles from 4 normal and 4 acute myeloid leukemia in the artificial intelligence system.\nTwo mathematical algorithms termed 018330 and 025886 were generated. When tested against a cohort of 312 normal and 39 acute myeloid leukemia subjects, both algorithms combined showed high discriminatory power with a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of 0.912.\nThe present results suggest that machine learning systems hold a great promise in the interpretation of hematological flow cytometry data.", "The current study was designed to analyze the clinical spectrum of Psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES) in children.\nChildren aged 6-16years with clinically suspected PNES, confirmed by short-term VEEG (STVEEG{video electroencephalogram}) and induction were classified as per Seneviratne classification. Stressors, associated co morbidities, Verbal IQ (Intelligence Quotient) and behavioral abnormalities were assessed using HTP(House tree person) test, DSM IV (Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders) TR criteria, MISIC (Malin intelligence scale for Indian children) and CBCL (Child behaviour checklist).\nEighty children with PNES {45 boys; mean age: 10.5 (\u00b11.6) years} were enrolled. Median delay in diagnosis was 5 months {IQR(interquartile range)- 0.5 to 48 months}) and 45% patients were already on AEDs (antiepileptic drugs). Commonest semiology was dialeptic (42.5%), followed by mixed (28.8%), motor (15%) and nonepileptic aura (13.8%). Family stressors were the commonest followed by school related issues. The most common psychiatric comorbidity was adjustment disorder. Somatic complaints were observed in 50% children.\nDialeptic PNES is commonest in children. In resource constrained settings, STVEEG along with induction is a reliable method to diagnose PNES. A comprehensive assessment protocol (including assessment of stressors) is needed for holistic management of pediatric PNES.", "Despite the diversity of electric wheelchairs, many people with physical limitations and seniors have difficulty using their standard joystick. As a result, they cannot meet their needs or ensure safe travel. Recent assistive technologies can help to give them autonomy and independence. This work deals with the real-time implementation of an artificial intelligence device to overcome these problems. Following a review of the literature from previous work, we present the methodology and process for implementing our intelligent control system on an electric wheelchair. The system is based on a neural algorithm that overcomes problems with standard joystick maneuvers such as the inability to move correctly in one direction. However, this implies the need for an appropriate methodology to map the position of the joystick handle. Experiments on a real wheelchair are carried out with real patients of the Mohamed Kassab National Institute Orthopedic, Physical and Functional Rehabilitation Hospital of Tunis. The proposed intelligent system gives good results compared to the use of a standard joystick.", "On-chip LiDAR sensors for vehicle collision avoidance are a rapidly expanding area of research and development. The assessment of reliable obstacle detection using data collected by LiDAR sensors has become a key issue that the scientific community is actively exploring. The design of a self-tuning methodology and its implementation are presented in this paper, to maximize the reliability of LiDAR sensors network for obstacle detection in the 'Internet of Things' (IoT) mobility scenarios. The Webots Automobile 3D simulation tool for emulating sensor interaction in complex driving environments is selected in order to achieve that objective. Furthermore, a model-based framework is defined that employs a point-cloud clustering technique, and an error-based prediction model library that is composed of a multilayer perceptron neural network, and k-nearest neighbors and linear regression models. Finally, a reinforcement learning technique, specifically a Q-learning method, is implemented to determine the number of LiDAR sensors that are required to increase sensor reliability for obstacle localization tasks. In addition, a IoT driving assistance user scenario, connecting a five LiDAR sensor network is designed and implemented to validate the accuracy of the computational intelligence-based framework. The results demonstrated that the self-tuning method is an appropriate strategy to increase the reliability of the sensor network while minimizing detection thresholds.", "In recent years, there has been a widespread deployment of submersible fluorescence sensors by water utilities. They are used to measure diagnostic pigments and estimate algae and cyanobacteria abundance in near real-time. Despite being useful and promising tools, operators and decision-makers often rely on the data provided by these probes without a full understanding of their limitations. As a result, this may lead to wrong and misleading estimations which, in turn, means that researchers and technicians distrust these sensors. In this review paper, we list and discuss the main limitations of such probes, as well as identifying the effect of environmental factors on pigment production, and in turn, the conversion to cyanobacteria abundance estimation. We argue that a comprehensive calibration approach to obtain reliable readings goes well beyond manufacturers' recommendations, and should involve several context-specific experiments. We also believe that if such a comprehensive set of experiments is conducted, the data collected from fluorescence sensors could be used in artificial intelligence modelling approaches to reliably predict, in near real-time, the presence and abundance of different cyanobacteria species. This would have significant benefits for both drinking and recreational water management, given that cyanobacterial toxicity, and taste and odour compounds production, are species-dependent.", "The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (DSM-V), criterion symptom listings are frequently used in clinical practice as checklists to make diagnoses. However, most DSM-V conditions are, in fact, syndromes, that is, collections of signs and symptoms that commonly occur together in the clinic. This report discusses the value of syndromes in medicine and psychiatry. It is argued that a more precise future enumeration of brain circuits and the pathogenesis of psychiatric conditions will help us better understand and treat psychiatric syndromes, but they are unlikely to eliminate the need to categorize psychiatric conditions. We expect that biomarkers will play an increasingly critical role in psychiatric diagnosis. Beyond a better mechanistic understanding of the DSM-V syndromes, future diagnostic efforts will need to increase the focus on function and address risk factors for nonresponse and relapse. We suggest that new artificial intelligence advances will increase the efficiency and acceptability of psychiatric diagnosis and assist with treatment delivery.", "Approximately 20% of children in Canada and the United States are raised in bilingual family homes. Current recommendations for typically developing children are to encourage and support bilingual exposure in the home; however, there are no specific guidelines for families of children with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), a disorder in which communication deficits are considered a hallmark feature.\nThe aim of this study is to present a scoping review of studies that compare cognitive, linguistic, and behavioral outcomes for children with ASDs raised in monolingual vs bilingual homes.\nA systematic search of 6 databases for peer-reviewed literature and gray literature search through dissertation databases, conference archives, and reference lists of pertinent studies was conducted.\nNine studies were included. No consistent differences were observed in the categories of core ASDs behaviors, cognitive function, or language. The studies suggest a potential bilingual advantage on nonverbal intelligence quotient scores, adaptive functioning, and expressive vocabulary.\nThere is no evidence of a detrimental effect of raising children with ASDs in a bilingual home.", "Aberrant motor function is an integral part of schizophrenia. In fact, abnormalities are frequently found in patients, in populations at risk, and in unaffected relatives. Motor abnormalities are suspected to be relevant for the clinical outcome and could probably predict the conversion from at-risk individuals to schizophrenia. Furthermore, motor function has been argued as endophenotype of the disorder. Yet, which particular motor domain may classify as a potential endophenotype is unknown. We aimed to compare schizophrenia patients, unaffected first-degree relatives and healthy controls for different motor domains. We expected impairments in all domains in patients and in some domains in relatives.\nWe included 43 schizophrenia patients, 34 unaffected first-degree relatives of schizophrenia patients, and 29 healthy control subjects, matched for age, gender, and education level. We compared motor function of four motor domains between the groups. The domains comprise neurological soft signs (NSS), abnormal involuntary movements (dyskinesia), Parkinsonism, and fine motor function including simple [finger tapping (FT)] and complex fine motor function, (i.e., dexterity as measured with the coin rotation test). Furthermore, we tested the association of motor function of the four domains with working memory, frontal lobe function, and nonverbal intelligence for each group separately using within-group bivariate correlations.\nSchizophrenia patients showed poorer motor function in all tested domains compared to healthy controls. First-degree relatives had intermediate ratings with aberrant function in two motor domains. In detail, relatives had significantly more NSS and performed poorer in the FT task than controls. In contrast, complex fine motor function was intact in relatives. Relatives did not differ from controls in dyskinesia or Parkinsonism severity.\nTaken together, schizophrenia patients have motor abnormalities in all tested domains. Thus, motor abnormalities are a key element of the disorder. Likewise, first-degree relatives presented motor deficits in two domains. A clear difference between relatives and healthy controls was found for NSS and FT. Thus, NSS and FT may be potential markers of vulnerability for schizophrenia. The lack of association between genetic risk and dyskinesia or Parkinsonism suggests distinct pathobiological mechanisms in the various motor abnormalities in schizophrenia.", "Human visual memory is tolerant, meaning that it supports object recognition despite variability across encounters at the image level. Tolerant object recognition remains one capacity in which artificial intelligence trails humans. Typically, tolerance is described as a property of human visual long-term memory (VLTM). In contrast, visual working memory (VWM) is not usually ascribed a role in tolerant recognition, with tests of that system usually demanding discriminatory power-identifying changes, not sameness. There are good reasons to expect that VLTM is more tolerant; functionally, recognition over the long-term must accommodate the fact that objects will not be viewed under identical conditions; and practically, the passive and massive nature of VLTM may impose relatively permissive criteria for thinking that two inputs are the same. But empirically, tolerance has never been compared across working and long-term visual memory. We therefore developed a novel paradigm for equating encoding and test across different memory types. In each experiment trial, participants saw two objects, memory for one tested immediately (VWM) and later for the other (VLTM). VWM performance was better than VLTM and remained robust despite the introduction of image and object variability. In contrast, VLTM performance suffered linearly as more variability was introduced into test stimuli. Additional experiments excluded interference effects as causes for the observed differences. These results suggest the possibility of a previously unidentified role for VWM in the acquisition of tolerant representations for object recognition.

Within a generation, the Internet has matured from a technological marvel to a utility, and mobile telephones have redefined how we communicate. Health care, as an industry, is quick to embrace technology, so it is no surprise that the application of programmable robotic systems that can carry out actions automatically and artificial intelligence (AI), e.g., machines that learn, solve problems, and respond to their environment, is being keenly explored.", "Participatory sensing combines the powerful sensing capabilities of current mobile devices with the mobility and intelligence of human beings, and as such has to potential to collect various types of information at a high spatial and temporal resolution. Success, however, entirely relies on the willingness and motivation of the users to carry out sensing tasks, and thus it is essential to incentivize the users&rsquo; active participation. In this article, we first present an open, generic participatory sensing framework (Citizense) which aims to make participatory sensing more accessible, flexible and transparent. Within the context of this framework we adopt three monetary incentive mechanisms which prioritize the fairness for the users while maintaining their simplicity and portability: fixed micro-payment, variable micro-payment and lottery. This incentive-enabled framework is then deployed on a large scale, real-world case study, where 230 participants were exposed to 44 different sensing campaigns. By randomly distributing incentive mechanisms among participants and a subset of campaigns, we study the behaviors of the overall population as well as the behaviors of different subgroups divided by demographic information with respect to the various incentive mechanisms. As a result of our study, we can conclude that (1) in general, monetary incentives work to improve participation rate; (2) for the overall population, a general descending order in terms of effectiveness of the incentive mechanisms can be established: fixed micro-payment first, then lottery-style payout and finally variable micro-payment. These two conclusions hold for all the demographic subgroups, even though different different internal distances between the incentive mechanisms are observed for different subgroups. Finally, a negative correlation between age and participation rate was found: older participants contribute less compared to their younger peers.", "Sleep recommendations are widely used to guide communities on children's sleep needs. Following recent adjustments to guidelines by the National Sleep Foundation and the subsequent consensus statement by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine, we undertook a systematic literature search to evaluate the current evidence regarding relationships between objectively measured sleep duration and cognitive function in children aged 5 to 13 years.\nCognitive function included measures of memory, attention, processing speed, and intelligence in children aged 5 to 13 years. Keyword searches of 7 databases to December 2016 found 23 meeting inclusion criteria from 137 full articles reviewed, 19 of which were suitable for meta-analysis.\nA significant effect (r = .06) was found between sleep duration and cognition, suggesting that longer sleep durations were associated with better cognitive functioning. Analyses of different cognitive domains revealed that full/verbal IQ was significantly associated with sleep loss, but memory, fluid IQ, processing speed and attention were not. Comparison of study sleep durations with current sleep recommendations showed that most children studied had sleep durations that were not within the range of recommended sleep. As such, the true effect of sleep loss on cognitive function may be obscured in these samples, as most children were sleep restricted.\nFuture research using more rigorous experimental methodologies is needed to properly elucidate the relationship between sleep duration and cognition in this age group.", "Big data analysis has become a common way to extract information from complex and large datasets among most scientific domains. This approach is now used to study large cohorts of patients in medicine. This work is a review of publications that have used artificial intelligence and advanced machine learning techniques to study physio pathogenesis-based treatments in pSS. A systematic literature review retrieved all articles reporting on the use of advanced statistical analysis applied to the study of systemic autoimmune diseases (SADs) over the last decade. An automatic bibliography screening method has been developed to perform this task. The program called BIBOT was designed to fetch and analyze articles from the pubmed database using a list of keywords and Natural Language Processing approaches. The evolution of trends in statistical approaches, sizes of cohorts and number of publications over this period were also computed in the process. In all, 44077 abstracts were screened and 1017 publications were analyzed. The mean number of selected articles was 101.0 (S.D. 19.16) by year, but increased significantly over the time (from 74 articles in 2008 to 138 in 2017). Among them only 12 focused on pSS but none of them emphasized on the aspect of pathogenesis-based treatments. To conclude, medicine progressively enters the era of big data analysis and artificial intelligence, but these approaches are not yet used to describe pSS-specific pathogenesis-based treatment. Nevertheless, large multicentre studies are investigating this aspect with advanced algorithmic tools on large cohorts of SADs patients.", "This article has been prepared by David Welchman on behalf of the APHA Avian Expert Group and Anna Brzozowska of the APHA's Surveillance Intelligence Unit.", "Contemporary cognitive neuroscience recognises unconstrained processing varies across individuals, describing variation in meaningful attributes, such as intelligence. It may also have links to patterns of on-going experience. This study examined whether dimensions of population variation in different modes of unconstrained processing can be described by the associations between patterns of neural activity and self-reports of experience during the same period. We selected 258 individuals from a publicly available data set who had measures of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging, and self-reports of experience during the scan. We used machine learning to determine patterns of association between the neural and self-reported data, finding variation along four dimensions. 'Purposeful' experiences were associated with lower connectivity - in particular default mode and limbic networks were less correlated with attention and sensorimotor networks. 'Emotional' experiences were associated with higher connectivity, especially between limbic and ventral attention networks. Experiences focused on themes of 'personal importance' were associated with reduced functional connectivity within attention and control systems. Finally, visual experiences were associated with stronger connectivity between visual and other networks, in particular the limbic system. Some of these patterns had contrasting links with cognitive function as assessed in a separate laboratory session - purposeful thinking was linked to greater intelligence and better abstract reasoning, while a focus on personal importance had the opposite relationship. Together these findings are consistent with an emerging literature on unconstrained states and also underlines that these states are heterogeneous, with distinct modes of population variation reflecting the interplay of different large-scale networks.", "At the beginning of the ancient \"Silk Road\", traditional Chinese medicine resources (TCM resources) have long been integrated into it, and it was once the \"important part\" of the ancient \"Silk Road\" in Chinese history, benefited from this, the political connections was strengthened, the economic and trade was developed, and Chinese medicine culture was spread. Before Qing Dynasty, people took out the \"silk\" and brought back \"herbs\" on the \"Silk Road\", which enriched China's medicinal resources. While in the later Qing Dynasty and the period of the Republic of China, more scientific and technological methods were brought back from abroad, and this in turn enriched the medical research methods. With more than 2 000 years' development, China's boundaries have changed countless times, therefore the word \"Foreign\" has different meanings in different historical periods. The import, development and utilization of foreign TCM resources is different in different historical periods, at present, with the continuous enhancement of China's comprehensiv national strength\uff0cespecially the \"Belt And Road\" strategy, the communication and import of TCM resources with countries that participating in the \"Belt and Road\" initiativ became much easier. In order to actively respond to the \"Belt and Road\" initiative promote the development and utilization of foreign medicinal resources; serve people from the countries participating in the \"Belt and Road\" initiative we sorted out the foreign TCM resources from different periods in ancient and modern China, and based on this, we proposed the strategy of import of foreign TCM resources under the new situation, those are: \"three levels, four steps, one support and one key\". And \"three levels\" refers to intelligence collection level, field investigation level, scientific research level, \"Four steps\" refers to the original identification research, safety evaluation research, functional positioning research and medicinal properties research; \"One support\" refers to relying on overseas Chinese or Chinese enterprises with working foundation and network resources, \"One key\" refers to the protection of the intellectual property rights of foreign TCM resources at the policy level and to mobilize the initiative of all parties.", "Visual-motor integration (VMI) skills, defined as the coordination of fine motor and visual perceptual abilities, are a very good indicator of a child's overall level of functioning. Research has clearly established that children with intellectual disability (ID) have deficits in VMI skills. This article presents a meta-analytic review of 10 research studies involving 652 children with mild ID for which a VMI skills assessment was also available. We measured the standardized mean difference (Hedges' g) between scores on VMI tests of these children with mild ID and either typically developing children's VMI test scores in these studies or normative mean values on VMI tests used by the studies. While mild ID is defined in part by intelligence scores that are two to three standard deviations below those of typically developing children, the standardized mean difference of VMI differences between typically developing children and children with mild ID in this meta-analysis was 1.75 (95% CI [1.11, 2.38]). Thus, the intellectual and adaptive skill deficits of children with mild ID may be greater (perhaps especially due to their abstract and conceptual reasoning deficits) than their relative VMI deficits. We discuss the possible meaning of this relative VMI strength among children with mild ID and suggest that their stronger VMI skills may be a target for intensive academic interventions as a means of attenuating problems in adaptive functioning.", "To quantify the longitudinal cognitive trajectory, before and after surgery, of Rasmussen syndrome (RS), a rare disease characterized by focal epilepsy and progressive atrophy of one cerebral hemisphere.\nThirty-two patients (mean age = 6.7 years; 17 male, 16 left hemispheres affected) were identified from hospital records. The changes in intelligence scores during 2 important phases in the patients' journey to treatment were investigated: (1) during the preoperative period (n = 28, mean follow-up 3.4 years) and (2) from before to after surgery (n = 21 patients, mean time to follow-up 1.5 years). A volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) analysis of longitudinal changes in gray matter volume was conducted in a subsample of 18 patients.\n(1) IQ during the preoperative period: At baseline assessment (on average 2.4 years after seizure onset), the left RS group had lower verbal than nonverbal intellectual abilities, whereas the right group exhibited more difficulties in nonverbal than verbal intellect. Verbal and nonverbal scores declined during the follow-up in both groups, irrespective of the affected side. Hemispheric gray matter volumes declined over time in both groups in affected as well as unaffected hemispheres. (2) Postoperative IQ change: The left surgery group declined further in verbal and nonverbal intellect. The right group's nonverbal intellect declined after surgery, whereas verbal abilities did not. Patients with higher abilities preoperatively experienced large declines, whereas those with poorer abilities showed little change. Postoperative seizures negatively impacted on cognitive abilities.\nDuring the chronic phase of the disease, parallel decline of verbal and nonverbal abilities suggest progressive bilateral hemispheric involvement, supported by evidence from MRI morphometry. Postsurgical cognitive losses are predicted by greater presurgical ability and continuing seizures. A shorter duration from seizure onset to surgery could reduce the postoperative cognitive burden by minimizing the decline in functions supported by the unaffected hemisphere.", "This study investigates the correlation of self-report accuracy with academic performance. The sample was composed of 289 undergraduate students (96 senior and 193 junior) enrolled in two engineering classes. Age ranged between 22 and 24\u00a0years, with a slight over representation of male students (53%). Academic performance was calculated based on students' final grades in each class. The tendency to report inaccurate information was measured at the end of the Raven Progressive Matrices Test, by asking students to report their exact finishing times. We controlled for gender, age, personality traits, intelligence, and past academic performance. We also included measures of centrality in their friendship, advice and trust networks. Correlation and multiple regression analyses results indicate that lower achieving students were significantly less accurate in self-reporting data. We also found that being more central in the advice network was correlated with higher performance (r = .20, p < .001). The results are aligned with existing literature emphasizing the individual and relational factors associated with academic performance and, pending future studies, may be utilized to include a new metric of self-report accuracy that is not dependent on academic records.", "The face is an important part of the human body by which an individual communicates in the society. Its importance can be highlighted by the fact that a person deprived of face cannot sustain in the living world. The amount of experiments being performed and the number of research papers being published under the domain of human face have surged in the past few decades. Several scientific disciplines, which are conducting research on human face include: Medical Science, Anthropology, Information Technology (Biometrics, Robotics, and Artificial Intelligence, etc.), Psychology, Forensic Science, Neuroscience, etc. This alarms the need of collecting and managing the data concerning human face so that the public and free access of it can be provided to the scientific community. This can be attained by developing databases and tools on human face using bioinformatics approach. The current research emphasizes on creating a database concerning literature data of human face. The database can be accessed on the basis of specific keywords, journal name, date of publication, author's name, etc. The collected research papers will be stored in the form of a database. Hence, the database will be beneficial to the research community as the comprehensive information dedicated to the human face could be found at one place. The information related to facial morphologic features, facial disorders, facial asymmetry, facial abnormalities, and many other parameters can be extracted from this database. The front end has been developed using Hyper Text Mark-up Language and Cascading Style Sheets. The back end has been developed using hypertext preprocessor (PHP). The JAVA Script has used as scripting language. MySQL (Structured Query Language) is used for database development as it is most widely used Relational Database Management System. XAMPP (X (cross platform), Apache, MySQL, PHP, Perl) open source web application software has been used as the server.The database is still under the developmental phase and discusses the initial steps of its creation. The current paper throws light on the work done till date.", "Treatment with glucocorticoids is the leading cause of drug-induced osteoporosis. National Osteoporosis Guideline Group (NOGG) 2017 guidelines advise a case-finding strategy for patients at risk. The aims of the audit were to evaluate the implementation of the NOGG 2017 guidelines for patients receiving long-term glucocorticoid therapy in a suburban general practice, to instigate changes to ensure 90% of patients are investigated and treated appropriately, and to evaluate impact at a 6-mo re-audit. Reporting Analysis and Intelligence Delivering Results (RAIDR) is a health-care intelligence tool accessing primary care clinical data. Using RAIDR, data on relevant osteoporotic risk factors were combined to produce FRAX scores for patients who had been prescribed glucocorticoids 3 or more times in the past 12 months. FRAX data were displayed in a NOGG guidance graph for major osteoporotic fracture probability. Patients were assessed as high, intermediate, or low risk. High- and intermediate-risk patients above the NOGG threshold were recommended to start bisphosphonates; these patients were sent a prescription for alendronate and a letter of explanation. There were no intermediate patients below the NOGG threshold. Low-risk patients were recommended to have lifestyle advice; a leaflet was produced and sent to these patients. Initial results showed that only 25% of patients recommended to be on bisphosphonates were taking them. Steps were taken to educate the general practitioners in the FRAX tool and NOGG guidelines; the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease annual template was amended to aid adherence by alerting the nurse to the number of glucocorticoid courses prescribed, with additional boxes for prescribing alendronate and printing the lifestyle leaflet; and 2-monthly RAIDR searches by the practice pharmacist were started. A re-audit 6\u2009mo later showed improvement to 92%. This audit showed that education, reminders, and simple computer prompts can greatly improve the implementation of NOGG guidelines for glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis.", "Openness to Experience is a complex trait, the taxonomic structure of which has been widely debated. Previous research has provided greater clarity of its lower order structure by synthesizing facets across several scales related to Openness to Experience. In this study, we take a finer grained approach by investigating the item-level relations of four Openness to Experience inventories (Big Five Aspects Scale, HEXACO-100, NEO PI-3, and Woo et\u00a0al.'s Openness to Experience Inventory), using a network science approach, which allowed items to form an emergent taxonomy of facets and aspects. Our results (N = 802) identified 10 distinct facets (variety-seeking, aesthetic appreciation, intellectual curiosity, diversity, openness to emotions, fantasy, imaginative, self-assessed intelligence, intellectual interests, and nontraditionalism) that largely replicate previous findings as well as three higher order aspects: two that are commonly found in the literature (intellect and experiencing; i.e., openness), and one novel aspect (open-mindedness). In addition, we demonstrate that each Openness to Experience inventory offers a unique conceptualization of the trait, and that some inventories provide broader coverage of the network space than others. Our findings establish a broader consensus of Openness to Experience at the aspect and facet level, which has important implications for researchers and the Openness to Experience inventories they use.", "The ability to read irregularly spelled words is commonly used to estimate premorbid intelligence, as this ability has been thought to be resistant to early effects of neurodegenerative disorders. However, studies evaluating decline of this skill in Alzheimer's disease (AD) have produced conflicting results. Irregular word reading was assessed three times over 36 months in a large (N = 995) sample, including healthy control, AD, and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) groups. At baseline, MCI and AD groups read correctly an average of 3.01 and 7.39 fewer words, respectively, than healthy controls. The MCI group's performance remained stable during the study, but the AD group declined. Importantly, the observed decline was likely an underestimate, as significant numbers of the AD participants (42.6%) could not complete the task at follow-up. Use of alternate (e.g., demographics-based) methods is advised to augment or replace word pronunciation in estimating premorbid intelligence in individuals with even mild AD.

We give a brief example that emphasizes the need for human intelligence in the rapidly evolving field of machine learning.", "Motivational interviewing is an effective intervention for supporting behavior change but traditionally depends on face-to-face dialogue with a human counselor. This study addressed a key challenge for the goal of developing social robotic motivational interviewers: creating an interview protocol, within the constraints of current artificial intelligence, which participants will find engaging and helpful.\nThe aim of this study was to explore participants' qualitative experiences of a motivational interview delivered by a social robot, including their evaluation of usability of the robot during the interaction and its impact on their motivation.\nNAO robots are humanoid, child-sized social robots. We programmed a NAO robot with Choregraphe software to deliver a scripted motivational interview focused on increasing physical activity. The interview was designed to be comprehensible even without an empathetic response from the robot. Robot breathing and face-tracking functions were used to give an impression of attentiveness. A total of 20 participants took part in the robot-delivered motivational interview and evaluated it after 1 week by responding to a series of written open-ended questions. Each participant was left alone to speak aloud with the robot, advancing through a series of questions by tapping the robot's head sensor. Evaluations were content-analyzed utilizing Boyatzis' steps: (1) sampling and design, (2) developing themes and codes, and (3) validating and applying the codes.\nThemes focused on interaction with the robot, motivation, change in physical activity, and overall evaluation of the intervention. Participants found the instructions clear and the navigation easy to use. Most enjoyed the interaction but also found it was restricted by the lack of individualized response from the robot. Many positively appraised the nonjudgmental aspect of the interview and how it gave space to articulate their motivation for change. Some participants felt that the intervention increased their physical activity levels.\nSocial robots can achieve a fundamental objective of motivational interviewing, encouraging participants to articulate their goals and dilemmas aloud. Because they are perceived as nonjudgmental, robots may have advantages over more humanoid avatars for delivering virtual support for behavioral change.", "Age-related cognitive decline and cognitive impairment represent the fastest growing health epidemic worldwide among those over 60. There is a critical need to identify effective and novel complex cognitive interventions to promote successful aging. Since piano training engages cognitive and bimanual sensorimotor processing, we hypothesize that piano training may serve as an effective cognitive intervention, as it requires sustained attention and engages an executive network that supports generalized cognition and emotional control. Here, I describe the protocol of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the impact of piano training on cognitive performance in adulthood, a period associated with decreased neuroplasticity. In this cluster RCT, healthy older adults (age 60-80) were recruited and screened to control for confounding variables. Eligible participants completed an initial 3-h assessment of standardized cognitive and psychosocial measures. Participants were stratified by age, education, and estimate of intelligence and randomly assigned to one of three groups: piano training, computer brain training, or a no-treatment control group. Computer brain training consisted of progressively difficult auditory cognitive exercises (Brain HQ; Posit Science, 2010). Participants assigned to training groups completed a 16-week program that met twice a week for 90 minutes. Upon program completion and at a 3-month follow-up, training participants and no-treatment controls completed a posttest visit lasting 2.5 hours.", "Over the past 20 years, neuroscience research on reward-based learning has converged on a canonical model, under which the neurotransmitter dopamine 'stamps in' associations between situations, actions and rewards by modulating the strength of synaptic connections between neurons. However, a growing number of recent findings have placed this standard model under strain. We now draw on recent advances in artificial intelligence to introduce a new theory of reward-based learning. Here, the dopamine system trains another part of the brain, the prefrontal cortex, to operate as its own free-standing learning system. This new perspective accommodates the findings that motivated the standard model, but also deals gracefully with a wider range of observations, providing a fresh foundation for future research.", "How does online technology affect sociability? Emerging evidence-much of it inconclusive-suggests a nuanced relationship between use of online technology (the Internet, social media, and virtual reality) and sociability (emotion recognition, empathy, perspective taking, and emotional intelligence). Although online technology can facilitate purely positive behavior (e.g., charitable giving) or purely negative behavior (e.g., cyberbullying), it appears to affect sociability in three ways, depending on whether it allows a deeper understanding of people's thoughts and feelings: (a) It benefits sociability when it complements already-deep offline engagement with others, (b) it impairs sociability when it supplants deeper offline engagement for superficial online engagement, and (c) it enhances sociability when deep offline engagement is otherwise difficult to attain. We suggest potential implications and moderators of technology's effects on sociability and call for additional causal research.", "Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common neurodevelopmental disorder in childhood. The psychostimulant methylphenidate is the most frequently used medication to treat it. Several studies have investigated the benefits of methylphenidate, showing possible favourable effects on ADHD symptoms, but the true magnitude of the effect is unknown. Concerning adverse events associated with the treatment, our systematic review of randomised clinical trials (RCTs) demonstrated no increase in serious adverse events, but a high proportion of participants suffered a range of non-serious adverse events.\nTo assess the adverse events associated with methylphenidate treatment for children and adolescents with ADHD in non-randomised studies.\nIn January 2016, we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, 12 other databases and two trials registers. We also checked reference lists and contacted authors and pharmaceutical companies to identify additional studies.\nWe included non-randomised study designs. These comprised comparative and non-comparative cohort studies, patient-control studies, patient reports/series and cross-sectional studies of methylphenidate administered at any dosage or formulation. We also included methylphenidate groups from RCTs assessing methylphenidate versus other interventions for ADHD as well as data from follow-up periods in RCTs. Participants had to have an ADHD diagnosis (from the 3rd to the 5th edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders or the 9th or 10th edition of theInternational Classification of Diseases, with or without comorbid diagnoses. We required that at least 75% of participants had a normal intellectual capacity (intelligence quotient of more than 70 points) and were aged below 20 years. We excluded studies that used another ADHD drug as a co-intervention.\nFourteen review authors selected studies independently. Two review authors assessed risk of bias independently using the ROBINS-I tool for assessing risk of bias in non-randomised studies of interventions. All review authors extracted data. We defined serious adverse events according to the International Committee of Harmonization as any lethal, life-threatening or life-changing event. We considered all other adverse events to be non-serious adverse events and conducted meta-analyses of data from comparative studies. We calculated meta-analytic estimates of prevalence from non-comparative cohorts studies and synthesised data from patient reports/series qualitatively. We investigated heterogeneity by conducting subgroup analyses, and we also conducted sensitivity analyses.\nWe included a total of 260 studies: 7 comparative cohort studies, 6 of which compared 968 patients who were exposed to methylphenidate to 166 controls, and 1 which assessed 1224 patients that were exposed or not exposed to methylphenidate during different time periods; 4 patient-control studies (53,192 exposed to methylphenidate and 19,906 controls); 177 non-comparative cohort studies (2,207,751 participants); 2 cross-sectional studies (96 participants) and 70 patient reports/series (206 participants). Participants' ages ranged from 3 years to 20 years. Risk of bias in the included comparative studies ranged from moderate to critical, with most studies showing critical risk of bias. We evaluated all non-comparative studies at critical risk of bias. The GRADE quality rating of the evidence was very low.Primary outcomesIn the comparative studies, methylphenidate increased the risk ratio (RR) of serious adverse events (RR 1.36, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.17 to 1.57; 2 studies, 72,005 participants); any psychotic disorder (RR 1.36, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.57; 1 study, 71,771 participants); and arrhythmia (RR 1.61, 95% CI 1.48 to 1.74; 1 study, 1224 participants) compared to no intervention.In the non-comparative cohort studies, the proportion of participants on methylphenidate experiencing any serious adverse event was 1.20% (95% CI 0.70% to 2.00%; 50 studies, 162,422 participants). Withdrawal from methylphenidate due to any serious adverse events occurred in 1.20% (95% CI 0.60% to 2.30%; 7 studies, 1173 participants) and adverse events of unknown severity led to withdrawal in 7.30% of participants (95% CI 5.30% to 10.0%; 22 studies, 3708 participants).Secondary outcomesIn the comparative studies, methylphenidate, compared to no intervention, increased the RR of insomnia and sleep problems (RR 2.58, 95% CI 1.24 to 5.34; 3 studies, 425 participants) and decreased appetite (RR 15.06, 95% CI 2.12 to 106.83; 1 study, 335 participants).With non-comparative cohort studies, the proportion of participants on methylphenidate with any non-serious adverse events was 51.2% (95% CI 41.2% to 61.1%; 49 studies, 13,978 participants). These included difficulty falling asleep, 17.9% (95% CI 14.7% to 21.6%; 82 studies, 11,507 participants); headache, 14.4% (95% CI 11.3% to 18.3%; 90 studies, 13,469 participants); abdominal pain, 10.7% (95% CI 8.60% to 13.3%; 79 studies, 11,750 participants); and decreased appetite, 31.1% (95% CI 26.5% to 36.2%; 84 studies, 11,594 participants). Withdrawal of methylphenidate due to non-serious adverse events occurred in 6.20% (95% CI 4.80% to 7.90%; 37 studies, 7142 participants), and 16.2% were withdrawn for unknown reasons (95% CI 13.0% to 19.9%; 57 studies, 8340 participants).\nOur findings suggest that methylphenidate may be associated with a number of serious adverse events as well as a large number of non-serious adverse events in children and adolescents, which often lead to withdrawal of methylphenidate. Our certainty in the evidence is very low, and accordingly, it is not possible to accurately estimate the actual risk of adverse events. It might be higher than reported here.Given the possible association between methylphenidate and the adverse events identified, it may be important to identify people who are most susceptible to adverse events. To do this we must undertake large-scale, high-quality RCTs, along with studies aimed at identifying responders and non-responders.", "Early childhood is a critical period for development of cognitive function, but research on the association between physical activity and cognitive function in preschool children is limited and inconclusive. This study aimed to examine the association between technology-assessed physical activity and cognitive function in preschool children. A cross-sectional analysis of baseline data from the Physical Activity and Cognitive Development Study was conducted in Shanghai, China. Physical activity was measured with accelerometers for 7 consecutive days, and cognitive functions were assessed using the Chinese version of Wechsler Young Children Scale of Intelligence (C-WYCSI). Linear regression analyses were used to assess the association between physical activity and cognitive function. A total of 260 preschool children (boys, 144; girls, 116; mean age: 57.2 &plusmn; 5.4 months) were included in analyses for this study. After adjusting for confounding factors, we found that Verbal Intelligence Quotient, Performance Intelligence Quotient, and Full Intelligence Quotient were significantly correlated with light physical activity, not moderate to vigorous physical activity, in boys. Standardized coefficients were 0.211, 0.218, and 0.242 (all p < 0.05) in three different models, respectively. However, the correlation between physical activity and cognitive functions were not significant in girls (p > 0.05). These findings suggest that cognitive function is apparently associated with light physical activity in boys. Further studies are required to clarify the sex-specific effect on physical activity and cognitive functions.", "Exposure to triclosan, an endocrine disrupting chemical, may affect thyroid hormone homeostasis and adversely affect neurodevelopment.\nUsing a longitudinal pregnancy and birth cohort, we investigated associations between triclosan exposures during different time windows, and cognitive test scores at 8 y of age in 198 children from the HOME Study.\nWe quantified triclosan in urine samples from mother-child pairs up to nine times between the second trimester of gestation and 8 y of age. The Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-IV [i.e., Full-Scale Intelligence Quotient (IQ)] assessment was administered to HOME Study children at 8 y of age. We estimated covariate-adjusted triclosan-IQ associations at each visit. We also tested whether associations between triclosan concentrations and cognitive test scores varied among exposure at different time periods.\nFull-Scale IQ was not significantly associated with urinary triclosan concentrations during gestation or childhood but was significantly associated with a 10-fold increase in maternal urinary triclosan concentration at delivery [-4.5\u2009points (95% CI: -7.0, -2.0)]. Perceptual Reasoning Index (PRI) scores were significantly decreased in association with urinary triclosan concentrations at delivery and at 2 y of age. Associations between repeated triclosan concentrations and cognitive test scores significantly varied among exposure at different time periods for Full-Scale IQ, PRI, Verbal Comprehension Index, and Working Memory (triclosan-visit interaction p\u22640.04).\nUrinary triclosan concentrations at delivery, but not during mid to late pregnancy and childhood, were associated with significantly lower children's cognitive test scores at 8 y of age in this cohort of U.S. children. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP2777.", "Contemporary realities of global population movement increasingly bring to the fore the challenge of quality and equitable health provision across language barriers. While this linguistic challenge is not unique to immigration contexts and is likewise shared by health systems responding to the needs of aboriginal peoples and other historical linguistic minorities, the expanding multilingual landscape of receiving societies renders this challenge even more critical, owing to limited or even non-existing familiarity of modern and often monolingual health systems with the particular needs of new linguistic minorities. The centrality of language to health beliefs, attitudes, practices, cultural scripts, and conceptual frameworks emphasizes its pivotal role in the healthcare process, and consequently in the adverse effects of treatment that is language-insensitive and unaware. Such an attitude on the part of medical authorities risks considerable epistemic injustice in the form of a (mis)judgement of patients' intelligence, credibility, and rationality based on the language that they speak and the manner in which they speak it, consequently impacting the quality and equity of care provided. This danger, I argue, may be effectively countered by fostering among the participants in the healthcare process a sense of epistemic humility through greater metalinguistic awareness. Outlining a range of operative steps that can be used to facilitate this. I argue that the reality of language barriers in the healthcare process, while not entirely eliminable, may nevertheless be successfully addressed, in order to mitigate the challenge of quality and equitable healthcare provision in multilingual societies.", "Various emerging technologies challenge existing governance processes to identify, assess, and manage risk. Though the existing risk-based paradigm has been essential for assessment of many chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear technologies, a complementary approach may be warranted for the early-stage assessment and management challenges of high uncertainty technologies ranging from nanotechnology to synthetic biology to artificial intelligence, among many others. This paper argues for a risk governance approach that integrates quantitative experimental information alongside qualitative expert insight to characterize and balance the risks, benefits, costs, and societal implications of emerging technologies. Various articles in scholarly literature have highlighted differing points of how to address technological uncertainty, and this article builds upon such knowledge to explain how an emerging technology risk governance process should be driven by a multi-stakeholder effort, incorporate various disparate sources of information, review various endpoints and outcomes, and comparatively assess emerging technology performance against existing conventional products in a given application area. At least in the early stages of development when quantitative data for risk assessment remain incomplete or limited, such an approach can be valuable for policymakers and decision makers to evaluate the impact that such technologies may have upon human and environmental health.", "High-performance stretchable and wearable electronic skins (E-skins) with high sensitivity and a large sensing range are urgently required with the rapid development of the Internet of things and artificial intelligence. Herein, a reduced graphene oxide (rGO)/polyaniline wrapped sponge is prepared via rGO coating and the in situ synthesis of polyaniline nanowires (PANI NWs) on the backbones of sponge for the fabrication of pressure sensors. From the as-prepared flexible sensor, tunable sensitivity (0.042 to 0.152 kPa-1), wide working range (0-27 kPa), fast response (\u223c96 ms), high current output (\u223c300 \u03bcA at 1 V), frequency-dependent performance reliable repeatability (\u223c9000 cycle) and stable signal waveform output can be readily obtained. In addition to tiny physiological activities (voice recognition, swallowing, mouth opening, blowing and breath), robust human motions (finger bending, elbow movement and knee squatting-arising) can also be detected in real-time by the flexible sensors based on rGO/polyaniline wrapped sponge. All the results demonstrate that the flexible pressure sensor based on the functional-sponge is a promising candidate for healthcare monitoring and wearable circuitry in artificial intelligence.", "Studying the cogni t ive development of blind children is particularly interesting in itself and because it provides intervention guidelines. The etiology of blindness is heterogeneous but this does not hinder the possibility of establishing the characteristics typical of its development. If these children acquire language at approximately 2 years, it means the last stage of sensorimotor intelligence has been achieved.\nTo determine the strategies that blind infants and toddlers adopt during the sensorimotor period to achieve an adequate level of development. Population and method. The study was carried out in students from a public Special Education School of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires. This was a qualitative study for the identification of coincidences to define strategies. Blind children aged 3 months to 3 years were observed. The analysis unit was each significant segment of the \"directed play\" sessions conducted in a Gesell chamber and guided by the stimulation therapist.\nThirty-four children were included and 55 observations were made. Children's \"modes of action\" were categorized as significant features of a strategy. Four thematic focuses and four stages were identified and chronologically supported with acquisitions that were considered \"organizers.\" The assessment showed that 71% of children achieved an adequate cognitive development for their age.\nSystematizing strategies will help to develop an instrument to detect delays and define intervention guidelines.\nIntroducci\u00f3n.

Machine learning methods excel in a\u00a0wide variety of tasks where sufficient data are available. We describe the application of a\u00a0deep convolutional neural network for the prediction of treatment indication with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) medications based on central retinal optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans. The neural network classifier was trained with OCT images acquired during routine treatment at the University of Regensburg over the years 2008-2016. In over 95% of the cases the treatment indication was accurately predicted based on a\u00a0singular OCT\u00a0B scan without human intervention. Despite promising classification the results of deep learning techniques, should always be controlled by the treating physician because false classification can never be excluded due to the probabilistic nature of the method.", "The Argentine neuropsychological school is born of the hand of the European school and is part of the beginning of the Experimental Psychology. In 1896 Horacio Pinero creates the first Department of Psychology at the University of Buenos Aires and in 1898 the first laboratory of Experimental Psychology is annexed. Jose Ingeniero, psychiatrist, neurologist, politician and above all sociologist publishes in France his work about the musical aphasia, the first neuropsychological work with international significance. In the same redeems to Charcot instead of to Knoblauch like the first one to describe the amusias, it speaks of an intelligence instead of a musical language and proposes a new classification and a methodology of assessment with a neurological-psychiatric integrative perspective. This article gave rise to this book in French on the musical language and its hysterical alterations awarded by the Academy of Medicine of Paris.\nJose Ingenieros y las amusias, sobre los origenes de la neuropsicologia argentina.\nLa escuela neuropsicologica argentina nace de la mano de la escuela europea y forma parte del inicio de la psicologia experimental.

FDP outcomes can help focus police investigations in search of unknown perpetrators, who are generally unidentifiable with standard DNA profiling. Therefore, we previously developed and forensically validated the IrisPlex DNA test system for eye colour prediction and the HIrisPlex system for combined eye and hair colour prediction from DNA traces. Here we introduce and forensically validate the HIrisPlex-S DNA test system (S for skin) for the simultaneous prediction of eye, hair, and skin colour from trace DNA. This FDP system consists of two SNaPshot-based multiplex assays targeting a total of 41 SNPs via a novel multiplex assay for 17 skin colour predictive SNPs and the previous HIrisPlex assay for 24 eye and hair colour predictive SNPs, 19 of which also contribute to skin colour prediction. The HIrisPlex-S system further comprises three statistical prediction models, the previously developed IrisPlex model for eye colour prediction based on 6 SNPs, the previous HIrisPlex model for hair colour prediction based on 22 SNPs, and the recently introduced HIrisPlex-S model for skin colour prediction based on 36 SNPs. In the forensic developmental validation testing, the novel 17-plex assay performed in full agreement with the Scientific Working Group on DNA Analysis Methods (SWGDAM) guidelines, as previously shown for the 24-plex assay. Sensitivity testing of the 17-plex assay revealed complete SNP profiles from as little as 63\u202fpg of input DNA, equalling the previously demonstrated sensitivity threshold of the 24-plex HIrisPlex assay. Testing of simulated forensic casework samples such as blood, semen, saliva stains, of inhibited DNA samples, of low quantity touch (trace) DNA samples, and of artificially degraded DNA samples as well as concordance testing, demonstrated the robustness, efficiency, and forensic suitability of the new 17-plex assay, as previously shown for the 24-plex assay. Finally, we provide an update to the publically available HIrisPlex website https://hirisplex.erasmusmc.nl/, now allowing the estimation of individual probabilities for 3 eye, 4 hair, and 5 skin colour categories from HIrisPlex-S input genotypes. The HIrisPlex-S DNA test represents the first forensically validated tool for skin colour prediction, and reflects the first forensically validated tool for simultaneous eye, hair and skin colour prediction from DNA.", "This article describes the DataBox project which offers a perspective of a new health data management solution in Germany. DataBox was initially conceptualized as a repository of individual lung cancer patient data (structured and unstructured). The patient is the owner of the data and is able to share his or her data with different stakeholders. Data is transferred, displayed, and stored online, but not archived. In the long run, the project aims at replacing the conventional method of paper- and storage-device-based handling of data for all patients in Germany, leading to better organization and availability of data which reduces duplicate diagnostic procedures, treatment errors, and enables the training as well as usage of artificial intelligence algorithms on large datasets.", "Background:\u00a0Fluid intelligence declines with advancing age, starting in early adulthood. Within-subject declines in fluid intelligence are highly correlated with contemporaneous declines in the ability to live and function independently. To support healthy aging, the mechanisms underlying these declines need to be better understood. Methods:\u00a0In this pre-registered analysis, we applied latent growth curve modelling to investigate the neural determinants of longitudinal changes in fluid intelligence across three time points in 185,317 individuals (N=9,719 two waves, N=870 three waves) from the UK Biobank (age range: 39-73 years). Results:\u00a0We found a weak but significant effect of cross-sectional age on the mean fluid intelligence score, such that older individuals scored slightly lower. However, the mean longitudinal slope was positive, rather than negative, suggesting improvement across testing occasions. Despite the considerable sample size, the slope variance was non-significant, suggesting no reliable individual differences in change over time. This null-result is likely due to the nature of the cognitive test used. In a subset of individuals, we found that white matter microstructure (N=8839, as indexed by fractional anisotropy) and grey-matter volume (N=9931) in pre-defined regions-of-interest accounted for complementary and unique variance in mean fluid intelligence scores. The strongest effects were such that higher grey matter volume in the frontal pole and greater white matter microstructure in the posterior thalamic radiations were associated with higher fluid intelligence scores. Conclusions:\u00a0In a large preregistered analysis, we demonstrate a weak but significant negative association between age and fluid intelligence. However, we did not observe plausible longitudinal patterns, instead observing a weak increase across testing occasions, and no significant individual differences in rates of change, likely due to the suboptimal task design. Finally, we find support for our preregistered expectation that white- and grey matter make separate contributions to individual differences in fluid intelligence beyond age.", "Blood lead level and its impact on haemoglobin and intelligence among school children near lead based industries, and to supplement them with a nutritious food for its effect, were studied. Blood was withdrawn from 120 children (9-12 years) and lead was estimated by Lead Care Analyzer Kit and haemoglobin by auto analyser. Culture Fair Non-verbal Test was used to assess the Intelligence Quotient. After pre-test, the experimental group (n = 60) were given nutritional supplementation for 3 months and education on hygiene measures, while the control group (n = 60) did not receive them. Food supplementation and education significantly decreased the lead level in the experimental group (8.8\u00b10.5 to 6.9\u00b10.4, \u03bcg/dL, mean \u00b1 SE) but not in the control group. The intelligence score improved in the experimental group but not in the control group. A negative correlation was observed between the lead level and intelligence. No improvement was observed in the haemoglobin. This study shows that the blood lead level in children near lead based industries is high and is negatively correlated with intelligence. Supplementation of nutritious food and education on hygiene measures have decreased the lead level and increased the intelligence score.", "Pathogenic variants in SCN1A can give rise to extremely variable disease severities that may be indistinguishable at their first presentation. We aim to find clinical features that can help predict the evolution of seizures into Dravet syndrome and clinical features that predict cognitive outcome in Dravet syndrome. We specifically investigate the role of contraindicated medication (CIM) as a possible modifier of cognitive decline.\nA cohort of 164 Dutch participants with SCN1A-related seizures was evaluated. Clinical data were collected from medical records and semistructured telephone interviews. Cognitive function was classified by a child neurologist, neuropsychologist, and clinical geneticist. Several clinical variables, including duration of CIM use in the first 5\u00a0years of disease, were evaluated in univariate and multivariate analyses.\nA longer duration of CIM use in the first 5\u00a0years after seizure onset was significantly associated with a worse cognitive outcome at time of inclusion, and with lower interpolated intelligence quotient/developmental quotient scores after the first 5\u00a0years of disease in Dravet syndrome patients. CIM use remained a significant predictor for cognitive outcome in a multivariate regression model, as did age at the first observation of developmental delay and age at first afebrile seizure. Age at first afebrile seizure was the most accurate predictor for evolution of seizures into Dravet syndrome for the complete cohort.\nOur data suggest that a longer CIM use in the first 5\u00a0years of disease can have negative effects on cognitive outcome in Dravet syndrome. An early diagnosis is essential to avoid these drugs. Furthermore, we identified age at first afebrile seizure as an important predictor for evolution of seizures into Dravet syndrome and for the severity of Dravet syndrome, which can be used to counsel parents of young patients with SCN1A-related seizures.", "Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is associated with positive outcomes for treatment-resistant mood disorders in the short term. However, there is limited research on long-term cognitive or psychological changes beyond 1 year after -ECT. This study evaluated long-term outcomes in cognitive functioning, psychiatric symptoms, and quality of life for individuals who had undergone ECT.\nEligible participants (N = 294) who completed a brief pre-ECT neuropsychological assessment within the last 14 years were recruited for a follow-up evaluation; a limited sample agreed to follow-up testing (n = 34). At follow-up, participants were administered cognitive measures (Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status [RBANS], Wide Range Achievement Test-4 Word Reading, Trail Making Test, Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Fourth Edition Letter Number Sequence and Digit Span, and Controlled Oral Word Association Test), along with emotional functioning measures (Beck Depression Inventory-Second Edition [BDI-II] and Beck Anxiety Inventory) and the World Health Organization Quality of Life-BREF quality of life measure. Follow-up-testing occurred on average (SD) 6.01 (3.5) years after last ECT treatment.\nAt follow-up, a paired t test showed a large and robust reduction in mean BDI-II score. Scores in cognitive domains remained largely unchanged. A trend was observed for a mean reduction in RBANS visual spatial scores. Lower BDI-II scores were significantly associated with higher RBANS scores and improved quality of life.\nFor some ECT patients, memory, cognitive functioning, and decreases in depressive symptoms can remain intact and stable even several years after ECT. However, the selective sampling at follow-up makes these results difficult to generalize to all post-ECT patients. Future research should examine what variables may predict stable cognitive functioning and a decline in psychiatric symptoms after ECT.", "Neurocognitive deficits at school starting age may affect as many as 50% of children who underwent cardiac surgery for complex congenital heart disease (CHD). The aim of this study was to identify which phases of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) are associated with an increased risk of impaired neurodevelopmental skills in children with complex CHD. This was assessed by means of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) plasma levels during CPB for CHD surgery, as a marker of neurologic insult. We correlated GFAP levels with clinical parameters and neurodevelopmental outcome.\nWe studied 45 children undergoing surgery for complex CHD. We measured plasma GFAP levels by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay at the following steps: anesthesia induction, CPB start, end of hypothermia, end of rewarming, and end of CPB. Neurologic assessment and Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales (VABS-I) were administered to patients at least 18 months after surgery.\nGFAP was undetectable before surgery and it peaked at the end of hypothermia or rewarming. Multiple regression analyses showed that GFAP peak level and preoperative neurologic comorbidity were significant independent predictors of neurologic impairment, as showed by VABS-I communication domain intelligence quotient (IQ). Receiver operating characteristic curve showed that the model was highly significant.\nImpaired neurodevelopment was associated with increase of GFAP plasma levels during cardiac surgery in infants. The identification of the neurologic high-risk phases of CPB run could support the application of new neuroprotective strategies for CHD repair.", "To develop simulation models for healthcare related questions clinical data can be reused.\nDevelop a clinical data warehouse to harmonize different data sources in a standardized manner and get a reproducible interface for clinical data reuse.\nThe Kimball life cycle for the development of data warehouse was used. The development is split into the technical, the data and the business intelligence pathway.\nSample data was persisted in the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM). The i2b2 clinical data warehouse tools were used to query the OMOP CDM by applying the new i2b2 multi-fact table feature.\nA clinical data warehouse was set up and sample data, data dimensions and ontologies for Austrian health claims data were created. The ability of the standardized data access layer to create and apply simulation models will be evaluated next.", "Event-related potential (ERP) components have been used to assess cognitive functions in patients with psychotic illness. Evidence suggests that among patients with psychosis there is a distinct heritable neurophysiologic phenotypic subtype captured by impairments across a range of ERP measures. In this study, we investigated the genetic basis of this \"globally impaired\" ERP cluster and its relationship to psychosis and cognitive abilities. We applied K-means clustering to six ERP measures to re-derive the globally impaired (n\u2009=\u200960) and the non-globally impaired ERP clusters (n\u2009=\u2009323) in a sample of cases with schizophrenia (SCZ\u2009=\u2009136) or bipolar disorder (BPD\u2009=\u2009121) and healthy controls (n\u2009=\u2009126). We used genome-wide association study (GWAS) results for SCZ, BPD, college completion, and childhood intelligence as the discovery datasets to derive polygenic risk scores (PRS) in our study sample and tested their associations with globally impaired ERP. We conducted mediation analyses to estimate the proportion of each PRS effect on severity of psychotic symptoms that is mediated through membership in the globally impaired ERP. Individuals with globally impaired ERP had significantly higher PANSS-positive scores (\u03b2\u2009=\u20093.95, P\u2009=\u20090.005). The SCZ-PRS was nominally associated with globally impaired ERP (unadjusted P\u2009=\u20090.01; R2\u2009=\u20093.07%). We also found a significant positive association between the college-PRS and globally impaired ERP (FDR-corrected P\u2009=\u20090.004; R2\u2009=\u20096.15%). The effect of college-PRS on PANSS positivity was almost entirely (97.1%) mediated through globally impaired ERP. These results suggest that the globally impaired ERP phenotype may represent some aspects of brain physiology on the path between genetic influences on educational attainment and psychotic symptoms.", "Previous research has shown that the use of technology and media, in their different available forms, may have detrimental effects on the physical and mental well-being of adolescents and young adults.\nThe present study aimed to investigate the use of different types of technology and media, attitudes toward them, and how they relate to physical and mental well-being in Lebanese university students.\nA descriptive, correlational, cross-sectional design was used. A sample of 244 undergraduates completed a self-report measuring media and technology use and attitudes, eating-related variables (e.g., healthy eating, body image dissatisfaction [BID], and eating disorders [EDs] risk), trait emotional intelligence (TEI), and psychopathology indicators (stress, anxiety, and depression).\nThe use of mobile phone multimedia (music, pictures, and videos) correlated with unhealthy eating and stress. Social media use was associated with BID, EDs risk, and the self-control construct of TEI. Anxiety of separation from technological devices and dependence on them was associated with increased BID, EDs risk, depression, and anxiety.\nPractical implications are discussed in terms of setting limits and boundaries on technology use during childhood and adolescence, and encouraging healthy eating and physical activity at home and on college campuses. Moreover, social media could be used as a platform for intervention and prevention programs to decrease BID, EDs, depression, and anxiety.", "Individual differences in lie detection remain poorly understood. Bond and DePaulo's meta-analysis examined judges (receivers) who were ascertaining lies from truths and senders (deceiver) who told these lies and truths. Bond and DePaulo found that the accuracy of detecting deception depended more on the characteristics of senders rather than the judges' ability to detect lies/truths. However, for many studies in this meta-analysis, judges could hear and understand senders. This made language comprehension a potential confound. This paper presents the results of two studies. Extending previous work, in Study 1, we removed language comprehension as a potential confound by having English-speakers (N = 126, mean age = 19.86) judge the veracity of German speakers (n = 12) in a lie detection task. The twelve lie-detection stimuli included emotional and non-emotional content, and were presented in three modalities-audio only, video only, and audio and video together. The intelligence (General, Auditory, Emotional) and personality (Dark Triads and Big 6) of participants was also assessed. In Study 2, a native German-speaking sample (N = 117, mean age = 29.10) were also tested on a similar lie detection task to provide a control condition. Despite significantly extending research design and the selection of constructs employed to capture individual differences, both studies replicated Bond and DePaulo's findings. The results of Study1 indicated that removing language comprehension did not amplify individual differences in judge's ability to ascertain lies from truths. Study 2 replicated these results confirming a lack of individual differences in judge's ability to detect lies. The results of both studies suggest that Sender (deceiver) characteristics exerted a stronger influence on the outcomes of lie detection than the judge's attributes.", "This paper examines narrative approaches to care within the context of dementia. It reviews the function of stories and explores some of the narrative genres that shape the cultural perceptions of dementia. We argue that narrative intelligence within healthcare is an important element in nurturing communal self-identity for people living with dementia. Listening and responding to stories and the cultural framework that this encompasses is an embodied action that is not just related to cognitive recall but situates us within a cultural community. People with dementia may have challenges in maintaining narrative legitimacy in the face of fractured stories and incoherent narratives. Health professionals can offer support in reframing and presenting counterstories that maintain identities that can potentially be marginalised, silenced and open to narrative foreclosure. This process requires health professionals to be attentive and responsive to how patients with dementia and their supporters construct and position the stories they tell and the meaning(s) they attach to them.", "The current measures of cognitive functioning in adulthood do not indicate a long-term association with prenatal exposure to the Dutch famine. However, whether such association emerges in China is poorly understood. We aimed to investigate the potential effect of prenatal exposure to the 1959-1961 Chinese famine on adult cognitive impairment. We obtained data from the Second National Sample Survey on Disability implemented in thirty-one provinces in 2006, and restricted our analysis to 387 093 individuals born in 1956-1965. Cognitive impairment was defined as intelligence quotient (IQ) score under 70 and IQ of adults was evaluated by the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale - China Revision. Famine severity was defined as excess death rate. The famine impact on adult cognitive impairment was estimated by difference-in-difference models, established by examining the variations of famine exposure across birth cohorts. Results show that compared with adults born in 1956-1958, those who were exposed to Chinese famine during gestation (born in 1959-1961) were at greater risk of cognitive impairment in the total sample. Stratified analyses showed that this effect was evident in males and females, but only in rural, not in urban areas. In conclusion, prenatal exposure to famine had an enduring deleterious effect on risk of cognitive impairment in rural adults.", "We used a case-control genome-wide association (GWA) design with cases consisting of 1238 individuals from the top 0.0003 (~170 mean IQ) of the population distribution of intelligence and 8172 unselected population-based controls. The single-nucleotide polymorphism heritability for the extreme IQ trait was 0.33 (0.02), which is the highest so far for a cognitive phenotype, and significant genome-wide genetic correlations of 0.78 were observed with educational attainment and 0.86 with population IQ. Three variants in locus ADAM12 achieved genome-wide significance, although they did not replicate with published GWA analyses of normal-range IQ or educational attainment. A genome-wide polygenic score constructed from the GWA results accounted for 1.6% of the variance of intelligence in the normal range in an unselected sample of 3414 individuals, which is comparable to the variance explained by GWA studies of intelligence with substantially larger sample sizes. The gene family plexins, members of which are mutated in several monogenic neurodevelopmental disorders, was significantly enriched for associations with high IQ. This study shows the utility of extreme trait selection for genetic study of intelligence and suggests that extremely high intelligence is continuous genetically with normal-range intelligence in the population.", "Hearing impaired children are heavily dependent on their sense of vision to develop efficient communication skills; any contrast sensitivity defect can negatively impact their lives because they are not able to use auditory stimuli to recognize probable dangers in the world around them. The purpose of this study was to determine the contrast sensitivity abnormalities in deaf individuals.\nIn this cross-sectional study, contrast sensitivity of 15- to 20-year-old high-school boys with hearing disability from Tehran, Iran were evaluated. Sixty-four eyes were tested for contrast sensitivity and refractive error. All subjects had an intelligence quotient (IQ) >70. We investigated their contrast sensitivity with Vector vision CVS-1000 in 4 different spatial frequencies.\nProfound hearing loss was noted in 50% of the subjects. The frequency of contrast sensitivity abnormalities in 4 different spatial frequencies varied between 51.6% and 65.6%. The largest abnormalities were recorded at 18 cycles per degree. Only 12.5% of deaf students had corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA) greater than zero (in LogMAR). The abnormalities in contrast sensitivity showed no correlation with the type or severity of hearing loss.\nHearing impaired boys are at a greater risk for contrast sensitivity abnormalities than boys with normal hearing. The larger frequency of contrast sensitivity abnormalities in high spatial frequencies than in other frequencies may demonstrate greater defects in the central visual system compared with the periphery in individuals with hearing loss.", "Prediction of agricultural energy output and environmental impacts play important role in energy management and conservation of environment as it can help us to evaluate agricultural energy efficiency, conduct crops production system commissioning, and detect and diagnose faults of crop production system. Agricultural energy output and environmental impacts can be readily predicted by artificial intelligence (AI), owing to the ease of use and adaptability to seek optimal solutions in a rapid manner as well as the use of historical data to predict future agricultural energy use pattern under constraints. This paper conducts energy output and environmental impact prediction of paddy production in Guilan province, Iran based on two AI methods, artificial neural networks (ANNs), and adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). The amounts of energy input and output are 51,585.61MJkg-1 and 66,112.94MJkg-1, respectively, in paddy production. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is used to evaluate environmental impacts of paddy production. Results show that, in paddy production, in-farm emission is a hotspot in global warming, acidification and eutrophication impact categories. ANN model with 12-6-8-1 structure is selected as the best one for predicting energy output. The correlation coefficient (R) varies from 0.524 to 0.999 in training for energy input and environmental impacts in ANN models. ANFIS model is developed based on a hybrid learning algorithm, with R for predicting output energy being 0.860 and, for environmental impacts, varying from 0.944 to 0.997. Results indicate that the multi-level ANFIS is a useful tool to managers for large-scale planning in forecasting energy output and environmental indices of agricultural production systems owing to its higher speed of computation processes compared to ANN model, despite ANN's higher accuracy.", "Working memory (WM) deficit is considered the key cause of learning difficulties (LDs). Studies have shown that WM is plastic and thus can be improved through training. This positive effect is transferable to fluid intelligence and academic performance. This study investigated whether WM updating ability and academic performance in children with LDs could be improved through WM updating training and explored the effects of this training on the children's brain activity. We used a running memory task lasting approximately 40 min per day for 28 days to train a group of 23 children with LDs (TLDs group). We also selected two control groups of 22 children with LDs (CLDs group) and 20 children without LDs (normal control [NC] group). The behavioral results of a pretest indicated that WM updating ability and academic performance in the TLDs and CLDs groups were significantly lower than those in the NC group before training. Compared with the CLDs group, the TLDs group exhibited significant performance improvement in a 2-back WM task, as well as in mathematical ability. Event-related potentials (ERPs) results suggested that the amplitudes of N160 (representative of visual recognition) and P300 (representative of updating processing, which is a valid index for updating WM) in the TLDs and CLDs groups were markedly lower than those in the NC group before training. In the TLDs group, these two components increased considerably after training, approaching levels similar to those in the NC group. The results of this study suggest that WM updating training can improve WM updating ability in children with LDs and the training effect can transfer to mathematical performance in such children. Furthermore, the participants' brain activity levels can exhibit positive changes. This article provides experimental evidence that WM updating training could mitigate the symptoms of LDs to a certain degree.", "Machines learn chemistry: An artificial intelligence algorithm has learned to predict the outcomes of C-N coupling reactions from a few thousand nanomole-scale experiments. This Highlight discusses this work in the context of other state-of-the-art approaches for predicting the yields of organic reactions and explains the significance of the results.", "The present study aims to analyze the psychometric characteristics of the TeLPI (Irregular Words Reading Test), a Portuguese premorbid intelligence test, using the Rasch model for dichotomous items.\nThe results reveal an overall adequacy and a good fit of values regarding both items and persons. A high variability of cognitive performance level and a good quality of the measurements were also found. The TeLPI has proved to be a unidimensional measure with reduced DIF effects.\nThe present findings contribute to overcome an important gap in the psychometric validity of this instrument and provide good evidence of the overall psychometric validity of TeLPI results.", "Studies in cultural evolution have uncovered many types of social learning strategies that are adaptive in certain environments. The efficiency of these strategies also depends on the individual characteristics of both the observer and the demonstrator. We investigate the relationship between intelligence and the ways social and individual information is utilised to make decisions in an uncertain environment. We measure fluid intelligence and study experimentally how individuals learn from observing the choices of a demonstrator in a 2-armed bandit problem with changing probabilities of a reward. Participants observe a demonstrator with high or low fluid intelligence. In some treatments they are aware of the intelligence score of the demonstrator and in others they are not. Low fluid intelligence individuals imitate the demonstrator more when her fluid intelligence is known than when it is not. Conversely, individuals with high fluid intelligence adjust their use of social information, as the observed behaviour changes, independently of the knowledge of the intelligence of the demonstrator. We provide evidence that intelligence determines how social and individual information is integrated in order to make choices in a changing uncertain environment.", "Bullying and cyberbullying are global public health problems. However, very few studies described prevalence, similarities and differences among face-to-face victims, cybervictims and students who are victimised through both bullying and cyberbullying. This study was conducted to describe these different patterns of victimisation and severity of victimisation, emotional intelligence and technology use in different types of victims.\nA total number of 2,139 secondary school students from 22 schools, randomly selected from all provinces of Andalusia, Spain, participated in this study. Information about bullying, cyberbullying, social networking sites use and perceived emotional intelligence was collected.\nFace-to-face victimisation only is the most common type of victimisation followed by mixed victimisation. Cybervictimisation only is rare. Mixed victims score higher in severity of bullying and present higher emotional attention than face-to-face victims.\nMost victims of cyberbullying are also face-to-face victims. Holistic approach that focuses on different problems at the same time seems to be needed to tackle these behaviours.", "Clinicians' interest in the long-term effects of early postnatal growth (EPG) is growing. There is compelling evidence linking rapid EPG with later cardiovascular risk, but its neurodevelopmental benefits still remain hypothetical in individuals born moderately preterm (MP) or small for gestational at term (SGAT).\nThe objective was to perform a systematic review of the relationship between EPG before age 3\u00a0years and neurodevelopmental outcome for individuals born MP (32-36\u00a0weeks' gestational age) or SGAT. Following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, 3 independent investigators searched for articles published on this topic in the Web of Science, EMBASE and PubMed from database inception to July 1, 2017. A detailed quality scale was used to evaluate articles.\nWe selected 19 articles relying on 12 distinct study populations; 7 articles from 3 study populations were considered at moderate or high quality. The lack of standardisation of growth analysis methods prevented performing a meta-analysis. Overall, EPG was positively associated with neurodevelopmental outcome, especially Intelligence Quotient (IQ) when available. In this relationship, the first 6\u00a0months of life might be a critical period. Analysis of the few articles investigating the shape of the relationships revealed a non-linear association, with a plateau for IQ with higher weight gain, which suggests a possible ceiling effect.\nA positive association was generally found between EPG and neurodevelopmental outcome for individuals born MP or SGAT. Strategies for future epidemiological studies are suggested to improve the characterisation of this relationship.", "Artificial intelligence technologies are widely investigated as a promising technique for tackling complex and ill-defined problems. In this context, artificial neural networks methodology has been considered as an effective tool to handle renewable energy systems. Thereby, the use of Tidal Stream Generator (TSG) systems aim to provide clean and reliable electrical power. However, the power captured from tidal currents is highly disturbed due to the swell effect and the periodicity of the tidal current phenomenon. In order to improve the quality of the generated power, this paper focuses on the power smoothing control. For this purpose, a novel Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is investigated and implemented to provide the proper rotational speed reference and the blade pitch angle. The ANN supervisor adequately switches the system in variable speed and power limitation modes. In order to recover the maximum power from the tides, a rotational speed control is applied to the rotor side converter following the Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) generated from the ANN block. In case of strong tidal currents, a pitch angle control is set based on the ANN approach to keep the system operating within safe limits. Two study cases were performed to test the performance of the output power. Simulation results demonstrate that the implemented control strategies achieve a smoothed generated power in the case of swell disturbances.", "The aim is to study the neuropsychological and functional profile of children and adolescents with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection on antiretroviral therapy (ART) and the association between the neuropsychological status and medical illness variables, treatment variables, and functional status in the cases of the sample and compare with normal controls.\nForty-two HIV-positive children and adolescents on ART were evaluated and compared with 40 matched controls not known to be HIV-positive. The tools used were the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-III R for neuropsychological evaluation, the Brief Impairment Scale to assess functional impairment, and a semi-structured questionnaire to obtain other relevant details.\nThere were significant differences between the verbal, performance intelligence quotients (IQs), global IQ score, and several individual subtests between cases and controls. The HIV group was also found to have a significant functional impairment.\nOur findings show that HIV infection is associated with significant cognitive and functional impairment. The role of ART in these impairments requires further study. Such understanding can help to introduce wholesome and relatively safer management strategies for youngsters with HIV infection and improve their quality of life.", "Personal intelligence (PI) involves the ability to recognize, reason, and use information about personality to understand oneself and other people. Employees in two studies (Ns = 394, 482) completed the Test of Personal Intelligence (TOPI; e.g., Mayer, Panter, & Caruso, 2017a) and assessments of workplace perception and behavior. Higher PI was associated with higher perceived workplace support and lower counterproductive work behavior. These relationships continued to hold after controlling for other key variables. The results indicate the TOPI, although still in research trials, shows promise as a screening device for selecting employees and targeting individuals for training.", "In Chinese Han population, Catechol-O-methyltransferase gene (COMT) rs4633 is found to be associated with impaired cognitive process. We aimed to investigate the association between COMT rs4633 and verbal intelligence and the underlying neural mechanisms in Chinese Han healthy young adults. In 256 Chinese Han healthy young adults, we explored the modulatory effects of COMT rs4633 on verbal intelligence quotient (VIQ) and functional connectivity density (FCD) of the brain and the mediation effect of FCD on the association between COMT and VIQ. We further investigated the association between the expression patterns of dopamine receptor genes and the effect of COMT on FCD in the human brain. COMT rs4633 TT homozygotes exhibited lower VIQ than CC homozygotes and TC heterozygotes, higher long-range FCD (lrFCD) than CC homozygotes and TC heterozygotes in the left superior frontal gyrus. TT homozygotes and TC heterozygotes showed higher lrFCD than CC homozygotes in the left inferior parietal lobule. The lrFCD differences across genotypic subgroups were negatively associated with the expression of DRD2 and DRD3 genes. The left parietal lrFCD mediated the association between COMT rs4633 and VIQ. These findings provide a biological pathway that COMT rs4633 affects verbal intelligence via modulating the lrFCD of the left inferior parietal lobule.", "The aim of this study was to determine changes in the sense of meaning in life of university students who participated in psychological workshops \"Communication-Forgiveness-Love\". The study evaluated 33 university students from first-cycle and second-cycle studies in physical education in the J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski University of Physical Education in Warsaw. The Reker's Life Attitude Profile-Revised Questionnaire, Social Competencies Questionnaire (KKS) by Matczak, Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire (INTE) by Schutte et al. and the Goldberg's General Health Questionnaire GHQ-28 were used. The study found that psychological workshops can be effective in instilling the sense of meaning in life in university students, especially those from first-cycle studies. The workshops can produce more benefits to students with worse mental status and with lower social competencies.", "Cognitive dysfunction (CD) is recognized by the American Cancer Society as a treatment effect in head and neck cancer, but the extent of this problem at baseline in oropharyngeal cancer (OPC), the most common subsite in current practice, to our knowledge has never been studied.\nTo assess the baseline cognition of patients with OPC using National Institutes of Health (NIH)-sponsored instruments of Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) and NIH Toolbox Cognitive Battery (NIHTB-CB).\nThis was a prospective cohort study conducted at a tertiary academic center. Of 83 consecutive patients, newly diagnosed as having OPC from September 2016 to May 2017, 16 were ineligible, 8 refused to participate, and 3 were lost to follow-up after screening, resulting in 56 study participants.\nSelf-perceived and objective cognition with PROMIS and NIHTB-CB standardized T scores, respectively, were main outcomes. Impairment was defined as (1) T scores less than 0.5 SD for PROMIS; (2) T score less than 1.5 SD in at least 1 cognitive domain or less than 1 SD in 2 or more domains for NIHTB-CB total cognition; and (3) T score per previously published criteria for NIHTB-CB intelligence-stratified cognition.\nOf the 56 study participants (52 men, 4 women; median age, 59 years [range, 42-77 years]), 19 (34%) had a college degree, and 20 (36%) had a professional or technical occupation. Thirty (about 53%) were never-smokers, 26 (46%) were never-drinkers, 29 (52%) were obese, 13 (23%) had a moderate to severe comorbidity, 3 (5%) used antidepressants, and 25 (52%) had hearing loss. Impaired self-reported, NIHTB-CB total, and intelligence-stratified cognition scores were observed in 6 (11%), 18 (32%), and 12 (21%), respectively. Among all variables, objective impairment was more common in men (23% vs 0%) and those with p16-negative OPC (33% vs 20%), moderate to severe comorbidity (31% vs 18%), and hearing loss (31% vs 12%).\nImpaired objective cognition was more common at baseline than self-reported, and was more frequent in men, participants with p16-negative OPC, moderate to severe comorbidity, and hearing loss. NIHTB-CB allowed immediate scoring of demographically adjusted cognitive function. In clinical practice, these scores can be used to identify patients with impaired cognition at baseline who may be susceptible to developing further impairment after treatment. Identification of impairment at baseline will help to institute early cognitive interventions, which may lead to an improved posttreatment quality of life.", "Individuals who believe that intelligence can be improved with effort (an incremental theory of intelligence) and who approach challenges with the goal of improving their understanding (a learning goal) tend to have higher academic achievement. Furthermore, parent praise is associated with children's incremental theories and learning goals. However, the influences of parental criticism, as well as different forms of praise and criticism (e.g., process vs. person), have received less attention. We examine these associations by analyzing two existing datasets (Study 1: N\u202f=\u202f317 first to eighth graders; Study 2: N\u202f=\u202f282 fifth and eighth graders). In both studies, older children held more incremental theories of intelligence, but lower learning goals, than younger children. Unexpectedly, the relation between theories of intelligence and learning goals was nonsignificant and did not vary with children's grade level. In both studies, overall perceived parent praise positively related to children's learning goals, whereas perceived parent criticism negatively related to incremental theories of intelligence. In Study 2, perceived parent process praise was the only significant (positive) predictor of children's learning goals, whereas perceived parent person criticism was the only significant (negative) predictor of incremental theories of intelligence. Finally, Study 2 provided some support for our hypothesis that age-related differences in perceived parent praise and criticism can explain age-related differences in children's learning goals. Results suggest that incremental theories of intelligence and learning goals might not be strongly related during childhood and that perceived parent praise and criticism have important, but distinct, relations with each motivational construct.", "We used data obtained by Caris Life Sciences, to evaluate the benefits of tailoring treatments for a breast carcinoma cohort by using tumor molecular profiles to inform decisions. Data for 92 breast cancer patients from the commercial Caris Molecular Intelligence database was retrospectively divided into two groups, so that the first always followed treatment recommendations, whereas in the second group all patients received at least one drug after profiling that was predicted to lack benefit. The biomarker and drug associations were based on tests including fluorescent in situ hybridization and DNA sequencing, although immunohistochemistry was the main test used. Patients whose drugs matched those recommended according to their tumor profile had an average overall survival of 667 days, compared to 510 days for patients that did not (P=0.0316). In the matched treatment group, 26% of patients were deceased by the last time of monitoring, whereas this was 41% in the unmatched group (P=0.1257). We therefore confirm the ability of tumor molecular profiling to improve survival of breast cancer patients. Immunohistochemistry biomarkers for the androgen, estrogen and progesterone receptors were found to be prognostic for survival.", "We analyzed current prescribing patterns for antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) in pregnant women with epilepsy (PWWE) at 20 USA tertiary epilepsy centers.\nThe Maternal Outcomes and Neurodevelopmental Effects of Antiepileptic Drugs (MONEAD) study is an NIH-funded, prospective, observational, multicenter investigation of pregnancy outcomes for both mother and child, which enrolled women from December 2012 to January 2016. Inclusion criteria for PWWE included ages 14-45\u202fyears and up to 20\u202fweeks gestational age. Exclusion criteria included history of psychogenic nonepileptic spells, expected intelligence quotient (IQ) <70, other major medical illness, progressive cerebral disease, and switching AEDs in pregnancy prior to enrollment.\nThree hundred fifty-one PWWE were enrolled in the MONEAD study, which included 259 (73.8%) on monotherapy, 77 (21.9%) on polytherapy, and 15 (4.3%) on no AEDs. The most common AED monotherapy regimens were lamotrigine (42.1% of monotherapies), levetiracetam (37.5%), carbamazepine (5.4%), zonisamide (5.0%), oxcarbazepine (4.6%), and topiramate (3.1%). All other individual monotherapies were each <1%. The most common AED polytherapy combination was lamotrigine\u202f+\u202flevetiracetam (42.9% of polytherapies), followed by lacosamide\u202f+\u202flevetiracetam (6.5%), lamotrigine\u202f+\u202fzonisamide (5.2%), and all other remaining combinations (each <4%); only 5.2% of polytherapy subjects were on \u22653 AEDs (1.1% of total PWWE). Only four subjects (1.1%) were on valproate (1 monotherapy, 3 polytherapy).\nThe distribution of AED use likely reflects current prescribing patterns for PWWE cared for in USA tertiary epilepsy centers. This distribution has changed markedly since the turn of the century, but changes in the general population remain uncertain.", "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have attracted considerable attention due to the intrinsic safety and high abundance of sodium. However, the lack of high-performance anode materials becomes a main obstacle for the development of SIBs. Here, we identify an ideal anode material, a metallic TiC3 monolayer with not only remarkably high storage capacity of 1278 mA h g-1 but also low barrier energy and open-circuit voltage, through first-principles swarm-intelligence structure calculations. TiC3 still keeps metallic after adsorbing two-layer Na atoms, ensuring good electrical conductivity during the battery cycle. Besides, high melting point and superior dynamical stability are in favor of practical application. Its excellent performance can be mainly attributed to the presence of an unusual n-biphenyl unit in the TiC3 monolayer. High cohesive energy, originating from multibonding coexistence (e.g., covalent, ionic, and metal bonds) in the TiC3 monolayer, provides strong feasibility for experimental synthesis. In comparison with TiC3, functionalized TiC3 with oxygen shows a higher storage capacity; meanwhile, it keeps nearly the same barrier energy. This is in sharp contrast with metal-rich MXenes. These intriguing properties make the TiC3 monolayer a promising anode material for SIBs.", "Footwear impressions are one of the most common forms of evidence to be found at a crime scene, and can potentially offer the investigator a wealth of intelligence. Our aim is to highlight a new and improved technique for the recovery of footwear impressions, using three-dimensional structured light scanning. Results from this preliminary study demonstrate that this new approach is non-destructive, safe to use and is fast, reliable and accurate. Further, since this is a digital method, there is also the option of digital comparison between items of footwear and footwear impressions, and an increased ability to share recovered footwear impressions between forensic staff thus speeding up the investigation.", "Background: To date, research exploring experiences and perspectives of people who have severe autism and are minimally verbal, has been sparse. Objectives: To build new understanding based on insider perspectives of people who have severe autism and are minimally verbal. We took interest in how these perspectives support, challenge, or augment current depictions of autism in academic literature. Method: Adopting a descriptive qualitative approach, three memoirs written by youths who have severe autism and are minimally verbal were examined using inductive thematic analysis. Analytic methods followed a recursive process of coding, collating, mapping, reviewing, creating clear themes, and then reporting using compelling extracts. Results: Analysis generated an over-arching theme regarding the youths' concern that the way they are perceived from the outside does not match the people they are on the inside. In explaining this mismatch, the youths identify differences in the way their brains work, as well as difficulty controlling their bodies. Conclusions: These youths emphasize concepts of embodiment and physical control as central to their experiences of autism. Findings highlight the need for research exploring insider perspective and the development of innovative methods to gain insight into the understanding and interests of people who are minimally verbal. Implications for rehabilitation The development of a communication system (hi-tech or low tech) should be a top priority for intervention when serving clients who have severe autism and are minimally verbal. When working with clients who have severe autism and are minimally verbal, clinicians should be cautious in applying and interpreting assessments of intelligence and understanding, since difficulties with verbal output and movement control can obscure results. To improve information gathering and therapeutic outcomes, clinicians and educators should use varied assessment and intervention techniques, administered across multiple sessions, and environments. Consideration should be given to difficulties with movement initiation and movement inhibition when guiding and interpreting behaviors.", "Several investigations suggest the presence of deterioration of executive function in fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS). The study quantified executive functions in patients with FMS. A wide array of functions was assessed, including updating, shifting and inhibition, as well as decision making and mental planning. Moreover, clinical variables were investigated as possible mediators of executive dysfunction, including pain severity, psychiatric comorbidity, medication and body mass index (BMI).\nFifty-two FMS patients and 32 healthy controls completed a battery of 14 neuropsychological tests. Clinical interviews were conducted and the McGill Pain Questionnaire, Beck Depression Inventory, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, Fatigue Severity Scale and Oviedo Quality of Sleep Questionnaire were presented.\nPatients performed poorer than controls on the Letter Number Sequencing, Arithmetic and Similarities subtests of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, the Spatial Span subtest of the Wechsler Memory Scale, an N-back task, a verbal fluency task, the Ruff Figural Fluency Test, the Inhibition score of the Stroop Test, the Inhibition and Shifting scores of the Five Digits Test, the Key Search Test and the Zoo Map Task. Moreover, patients exhibited less steep learning curves on the Iowa Gambling Task. Among clinical variables, BMI and pain severity explained the largest proportion of performance variance.\nThis study demonstrated impairments in executive functions of updating, shifting inhibition, decision making and planning in FMS. While the mediating role of pain in cognitive impairments in FMS had been previously established, the influence of BMI is a novel finding. Overweight and obesity should be considered by FMS researchers, and in the treatment of the condition.", "\"Disaster\" means some surprising and misfortunate event. Its definition is broad and relates to complex environments. Medical Informatics approaches, methodologies and systems are used as a part of Disaster and Emergency Management systems. At the Holon Institute of Technology - HIT, Israel, in 2016 a National R&amp;D Center: AFRAN was established to study the disaster's reduction aspects. The Center's designation is to investigate and produce new approaches, methodologies and to offer recommendations in the fields of disaster mitigation, preparedness, response and recovery and to disseminate disaster's knowledge. Adjoint to the Center a \"Smart, Intelligent, and Adaptive Systems\" laboratory (SIAS) was established with the goal to study the applications of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to Risk and Disaster Management (RDM). In this paper, we are redefining the concept of Disaster, pointing-out how ICT, AI, in the Big Data era, are central players in the RDM game. In addition we show the merit of the Center and lab combination to the benefit of the performed research projects.", "In recent years a growing body of research is focused on the relationships between emotions and health. When it comes to diabetes, findings suggest that distress might play a key role in the acquisition and maintenance of health habits associated with diabetic management. This report describes two studies examining the roles of emotional abilities in diabetic management from two different conceptual points of view using two culturally different samples. In study 1, we examined the relationship between emotional intelligence and HbA1c levels in a sample of eighty-five patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM1) in Israel. In study 2, we examined the relationship between specific emotional regulation strategies and HbA1c in sixty-seven adolescents with DM1, while examining the mediating role of distress in this association. The results showed a negative association between emotional intelligence and HbA1c levels, even after controlling for potential intervening factors. We found that the relationship between difficulties in emotion regulation and HbA1c seemed to be mediated by diabetes-related distress. These findings may aid in the design of psychological models for future research as well as interventions aimed at improving emotional abilities in people with DM1.", "With the increase of survival rates of pediatric cancer patients, the number of children facing potential cognitive sequelae has grown. Previous adult studies suggest that white matter (WM) microstructural changes may contribute to cognitive impairment. This study aims to investigate WM microstructure in childhood bone and soft tissue sarcoma. Differences in (micro-)structure can be investigated using diffusion MRI (dMRI). The typically used diffusion tensor model (DTI) assumes Gaussian diffusion, and lacks information about fiber populations. In this study, we compare WM structure of childhood bone and soft tissue sarcoma survivors (n\u00a0=\u00a034) and matched controls (n\u00a0=\u00a034), combining typical and advanced voxel-based models (DTI and NODDI model, respectively), as well as recently developed fixel-based models (for estimations of intra-voxel differences, apparent fiber density [AFD] and fiber cross-section [FC]). Parameters with significant findings were compared between treatments, and correlated with subscales of the WAIS-IV intelligence test, age at diagnosis, age at assessment and time since diagnosis. We encountered extensive regions showing lower fractional anisotropy, overlapping with both significant NODDI parameters and fixel-based parameters. In contrast to these diffuse differences, the fixel-based measure of AFD was reduced in the cingulum and corpus callosum only. Furthermore, AFD of the corpus callosum was significantly predicted by chemotherapy treatment and correlated positively with time since diagnosis, visual puzzles and similarities task scores. This study suggests altered WM structure of childhood bone and soft tissue sarcoma survivors. We conclude global chemotherapy-related changes, with particular vulnerability of centrally located WM bundles. Finally, such differences could potentially recover after treatment.", "Tuberculosis (TB) is a global issue that seriously endangers public health. Pathology is one of the most important means for diagnosing TB in clinical practice. To confirm TB as the diagnosis, finding specially stained TB bacilli under a microscope is critical. Because of the very small size and number of bacilli, it is a time-consuming and strenuous work even for experienced pathologists, and this strenuosity often leads to low detection rate and false diagnoses. We investigated the clinical efficacy of an artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted detection method for acid-fast stained TB bacillus.\nWe built a convolutional neural networks (CNN) model, named tuberculosis AI (TB-AI), specifically to recognize TB bacillus. The training set contains 45 samples, including 30 positive cases and 15 negative cases, where bacilli are labeled by human pathologists. Upon training the neural network model, 201 samples (108 positive cases and 93 negative cases) were collected as test set and used to examine TB-AI. We compared the diagnosis of TB-AI to the ground truth result provided by human pathologists, analyzed inconsistencies between AI and human, and adjusted the protocol accordingly. Trained TB-AI were run on the test data twice.\nExamined against the double confirmed diagnosis by pathologists both via microscopes and digital slides, TB-AI achieved 97.94% sensitivity and 83.65% specificity.\nTB-AI can be a promising support system to detect stained TB bacilli and help make clinical decisions. It holds the potential to relieve the heavy workload of pathologists and decrease chances of missed diagnosis. Samples labeled as positive by TB-AI must be confirmed by pathologists, and those labeled as negative should be reviewed to make sure that the digital slides are qualified.", "Emotional Intelligence (EI) has been an important and controversial topic during the last few decades. Its significance and its correlation with many domains of life has made it the subject of expert study. EI is the rudder for feeling, thinking, learning, problem-solving, and decision-making. In this article, we present an emotional\u207bcognitive based approach to the process of gaining emotional intelligence and thus, we suggest a nine-layer pyramid of emotional intelligence and the gradual development to reach the top of EI.", "Air pollution is defined as a phenomenon harmful to the ecological system and the normal conditions of human existence and development when some substances in the atmosphere exceed a certain concentration. In the face of increasingly serious environmental pollution problems, scholars have conducted a significant quantity of related research, and in those studies, the forecasting of air pollution has been of paramount importance. As a precaution, the air pollution forecast is the basis for taking effective pollution control measures, and accurate forecasting of air pollution has become an important task. Extensive research indicates that the methods of air pollution forecasting can be broadly divided into three classical categories: statistical forecasting methods, artificial intelligence methods, and numerical forecasting methods. More recently, some hybrid models have been proposed, which can improve the forecast accuracy. To provide a clear perspective on air pollution forecasting, this study reviews the theory and application of those forecasting models. In addition, based on a comparison of different forecasting methods, the advantages and disadvantages of some methods of forecasting are also provided. This study aims to provide an overview of air pollution forecasting methods for easy access and reference by researchers, which will be helpful in further studies.", "Emotional intelligence (EI) training is popular among human resource practitioners, but there is limited evidence of the impact of such training on health care workers.\nIn the current article, we examine the effects of EI training on quality of resident care and worker well-being and psychological empowerment in an Australian aged care facility. We use Bar-On's (1997) conceptualization of EI.\nWe used a quasiexperimental design in 2014-2015 with experimental (training) and control (nontraining) groups of 60 participants in each group in two geographically separate facilities. Our final poststudy sample size was 27 participants for the training group and 17 participants for the control group. Over a 6-month period, we examined whether staff improved their well-being, psychological empowerment, and job performance measured as enhanced quality of care (self-rated and client-rated) by applying skills in EI.\nThe results showed significant improvement among workers in the training group for EI scores, quality of care, general well-being, and psychological empowerment. There were no significant differences for the control group.\nThrough examining the impact of EI training on staff and residents of an aged care facility, we demonstrate the benefits of EI training for higher quality of care delivery. This study demonstrates the practical process through which EI training can improve the work experiences of aged care workers, as well as the quality of care for residents.", "Macromolecular crystallography is now a mature and widely used technique that is essential in the understanding of biology and medicine. Increases in computing power combined with robotics have not only enabled large numbers of samples to be screened and characterized but have also enabled better decisions to be taken on data collection itself. This led to the development of MASSIF-1 at the ESRF, the first beamline in the world to run fully automatically while making intelligent decisions taking user requirements into account. Since opening in late 2014, the beamline has processed over 42\u2005000 samples. Improvements have been made to the speed of the sample-handling robotics and error management within the software routines. The workflows initially put into place, while highly innovative at the time, have been expanded to include increased complexity and additional intelligence using the information gathered during characterization; this includes adapting the beam diameter dynamically to match the diffraction volume within the crystal. Complex multi-position and multi-crystal data collections have now also been integrated into the selection of experiments available. This has led to increased data quality and throughput, allowing even the most challenging samples to be treated automatically.", "Computer-aided synthesis planning (CASP) is focused on the goal of accelerating the process by which chemists decide how to synthesize small molecule compounds. The ideal CASP program would take a molecular structure as input and output a sorted list of detailed reaction schemes that each connect that target to purchasable starting materials via a series of chemically feasible reaction steps. Early work in this field relied on expert-crafted reaction rules and heuristics to describe possible retrosynthetic disconnections and selectivity rules but suffered from incompleteness, infeasible suggestions, and human bias. With the relatively recent availability of large reaction corpora (such as the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), Reaxys, and SciFinder databases), consisting of millions of tabulated reaction examples, it is now possible to construct and validate purely data-driven approaches to synthesis planning. As a result, synthesis planning has been opened to machine learning techniques, and the field is advancing rapidly. In this Account, we focus on two critical aspects of CASP and recent machine learning approaches to both challenges. First, we discuss the problem of retrosynthetic planning, which requires a recommender system to propose synthetic disconnections starting from a target molecule. We describe how the search strategy, necessary to overcome the exponential growth of the search space with increasing number of reaction steps, can be assisted through a learned synthetic complexity metric. We also describe how the recursive expansion can be performed by a straightforward nearest neighbor model that makes clever use of reaction data to generate high quality retrosynthetic disconnections. Second, we discuss the problem of anticipating the products of chemical reactions, which can be used to validate proposed reactions in a computer-generated synthesis plan (i.e., reduce false positives) to increase the likelihood of experimental success. While we introduce this task in the context of reaction validation, its utility extends to the prediction of side products and impurities, among other applications. We describe neural network-based approaches that we and others have developed for this forward prediction task that can be trained on previously published experimental data. Machine learning and artificial intelligence have revolutionized a number of disciplines, not limited to image recognition, dictation, translation, content recommendation, advertising, and autonomous driving. While there is a rich history of using machine learning for structure-activity models in chemistry, it is only now that it is being successfully applied more broadly to organic synthesis and synthesis design. As reported in this Account, machine learning is rapidly transforming CASP, but there are several remaining challenges and opportunities, many pertaining to the availability and standardization of both data and evaluation metrics, which must be addressed by the community at large.", "A 15-year-old girl presented with non-progressive sensorineural hearing impairment in her right ear since her early childhood. She had normal intellectual development. When she was 15 years old, small deep white matter lesions around the lateral ventricles were incidentally detected in brain MRI studies through further investigation of auditory organs. Laboratory data including cerebrospinal fluid analysis and antibodies to aquaporin-4 or myelin-oligodendrocyte glycoprotein were normal. She was diagnosed as a congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection based on the detection of CMV DNA from preserved umbilical cord tissue by real-time polymerase chain reaction. It should be kept in mind that a case of congenital CMV infection with normal intelligence may be underdiagnosed and that sensorineural hearing impairment from early childhood and deep white matter abnormalities can be key features giving rise to suspicion on congenital CMV infection.", "Substance abuse is a growing public health concern in the USA (US), especially now that the US faces a national drug overdose epidemic. Over the past decade, the number of drug overdose deaths has rapidly grown, largely driven by increases in prescription opioid-related overdoses. In recent years, increased heroin and illicitly manufactured fentanyl overdoses have substantially contributed to the rise of overdose deaths. Given the role of physicians in interacting with patients who are at risk for or currently abusing opioids and heroin, it is essential that physicians are aware of this issue and know how to respond. Unfortunately, medical school curricula do not devote substantial time to addiction education and many physicians lack knowledge regarding assessment and management of opioid addiction. While some schools have modified curricula to include content related to opioid prescription techniques and pain management, an added emphasis about the growing role of heroin and fentanyl is needed to adequately address the epidemic. By adapting curricula to address the rising opioid and heroin epidemic, medical schools have the potential to ensure that our future physicians can effectively recognize the signs, symptoms, and risks of opioid/heroin abuse and improve patient outcomes. This article proposes ways to include heroin and fentanyl education into medical school curricula and highlights the potential of simulation-based medical education to enable students to develop the skillset and emotional intelligence necessary to work with patients struggling with opioid and heroin addiction. This will result in future doctors who are better prepared to both prevent and recognize opioid and heroin addiction in patients, an important step in helping reduce the number of addicted patients and address the drug overdose epidemic.", "Since the mid 19th century, cognitive and behavioral neurosciences have attempted to find the neurological bases of intellectual abilities. During the early 20th century the psychometric concept of \"intelligence\" was coined; and toward the end of the 20th century the neuropsychological concept of \"executive functions\" was introduced. Controversies, however, remain about the unity or heterogeneity of so-called executive functions.\nIt is proposed that two major executive functions could be separated: metacognitive -or intelectual- and emotional/motivational. A similar distinction has been suggested by several authors. Standard definitions of intelligence implicitly assume that executive functions represent the fundamental components of intelligence.\nResearch has demonstrated that, if considered as a whole, executive functions only partially correspond to the psychometric concept of intelligence; whereas some specific executive functions clearly correspond to intelligence, some others do not involve intelligence.\nIf using a major distinction between metacognitive -or simply \"intellectual\"-executive functions, and emotional/ motivational -or simply non-intellectual-executive functions, it becomes evident that general intelligence can be equated with metacognitive executive functions but not with emotional/ motivational executive functions.", "The cerebellum supports many cognitive functions disrupted in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Prior neuroanatomic studies have been often limited by small sample sizes, inconsistent findings, and a reliance on cross-sectional data, limiting inferences about cerebellar development. Here, we conduct a multicohort study using longitudinal data, to characterize cerebellar development.\nGrowth trajectories of the cerebellar vermis, hemispheres and white matter were estimated using piecewise linear regression from 1,656 youth; of whom 63% had longitudinal data, totaling 2,914 scans. Four cohorts participated, all contained childhood data (age 4-12\u00a0years); two had adolescent data (12-25\u00a0years). Growth parameters were combined using random-effects meta-analysis.\nDiagnostic differences in growth were confined to the corpus medullare (cerebellar white matter). Here, the ADHD group showed slower growth in early childhood compared to the typically developing group (left corpus medullare z\u00a0=\u00a02.49, p\u00a0=\u00a0.01; right z\u00a0=\u00a02.03, p\u00a0=\u00a0.04). This reversed in late childhood, with faster growth in ADHD in the left corpus medullare (z\u00a0=\u00a02.06, p\u00a0=\u00a0.04). Findings held when gender, intelligence, comorbidity, and psychostimulant medication were considered.\nAcross four independent cohorts, containing predominately longitudinal data, we found diagnostic differences in the growth of cerebellar white matter. In ADHD, slower white matter growth in early childhood was followed by faster growth in late childhood. The findings are consistent with the concept of ADHD as a disorder of the brain's structural connections, formed partly by developing cortico-cerebellar white matter tracts.", "HBO's Westworld is located to the right of the uncanny valley, near the archipelago of governments proposing to regulate sexbots and strong artificial intelligence.", "The current study examined pre- and postoperative health-related quality of life (HRQL) across children with and without low intellectual ability. We also aimed to clarify the literature on postsurgical change by assessing domain-specific HRQL pre- and postoperatively in children with drug-resistant epilepsy.\nAll patients (n=111) underwent resective epilepsy surgery between 1996 and 2016 at the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto, comparing baseline and 1-year follow-up HRQL with the Quality of Life in Childhood Epilepsy Questionnaire (QOLCE-76). At the group-level, postsurgical change in HRQL was examined through linear mixed-effects modeling. Clinically important change in HRQL at the individual level was quantified using a standard error of measurement (SEM)-based criterion, and estimates were stratified by intellectual ability.\nChildren with epilepsy and low intellectual ability had lower overall HRQL compared with those with normal intelligence (b=-10.45, SE=4.89, p=.035). No differences in change in HRQL related to intellectual level were found. In the broader sample, significant postoperative improvements were found for HRQL related to physical activity (b=8.28, SE=1.79, p<.001), social activity (b=15.81, SE=2.76, p<.001), and behavior (b=4.34, SE=1.35, p=.001). Postoperative improvements in physical and social HRQL were associated with better seizure control (p=.011). Conversely, cognitive and emotional domains of HRQL did not improve one year postoperatively, even in the presence of improved seizure control.\nResults suggest that children with low intellectual ability can expect to achieve similar improvements in HRQL after epilepsy surgery compared with those with normal intelligence. Further, while overall HRQL is shown to improve in children following epilepsy surgery, domain-specific change is nuanced and has important implications for health practitioners aiming to monitor treatment progress of patients.", "Human lungs are susceptible to the toxicity induced by soluble xenobiotics. However, the direct cellular effects of many pulmonotoxic chemicals are not always clear, and thus, a general in vitro assay for testing pulmonotoxicity applicable to a wide variety of chemicals is not currently available. Here, we report a study that uses high-throughput imaging and artificial intelligence to build an in vitro pulmonotoxicity assay by automatically comparing and selecting human lung-cell lines and their associated quantitative phenotypic features most predictive of in vivo pulmonotoxicity. This approach is called \"High-throughput In vitro Phenotypic Profiling for Toxicity Prediction\" (HIPPTox). We found that the resulting assay based on two phenotypic features of a human bronchial epithelial cell line, BEAS-2B, can accurately classify 33 reference chemicals with human pulmonotoxicity information (88.8% balance accuracy, 84.6% sensitivity, and 93.0% specificity). In comparison, the predictivity of a standard cell-viability assay on the same set of chemicals is much lower (77.1% balanced accuracy, 84.6% sensitivity, and 69.5% specificity). We also used the assay to evaluate 17 additional test chemicals with unknown/unclear human pulmonotoxicity, and experimentally confirmed that many of the pulmonotoxic reference and predicted-positive test chemicals induce DNA strand breaks and/or activation of the DNA-damage response (DDR) pathway. Therefore, HIPPTox helps us to uncover these common modes-of-action of pulmonotoxic chemicals. HIPPTox may also be applied to other cell types or models, and accelerate the development of predictive in vitro assays for other cell-type- or organ-specific toxicities.", "Difficulty in controlling emotional impulses is a crucial component of borderline personality disorder (BPD) that often leads to destructive, impulsive behaviours against others. In line with recent findings in aggressive individuals, deficits in prefrontal amygdala coupling during emotional action control may account for these symptoms.\nTo study the neurobiological correlates of altered emotional action control in individuals with BPD, we asked medication-free, anger-prone, female patients with BPD and age- and intelligence-matched healthy women to take part in an approach-avoidance task while lying in an MRI scanner. The task required controlling fast behavioural tendencies to approach happy and avoid angry faces. Additionally, before the task we collected saliva testosterone and self-reported information on tendencies to act out anger and correlated this with behavioural and functional MRI (fMRI) data.\nWe included 30 patients and 28 controls in our analysis. Patients with BPD reported increased tendencies to act out anger and were faster in approaching than avoiding angry faces than with healthy women, suggesting deficits in emotional action control in women with BPD. On a neural level, controlling fast emotional action tendencies was associated with enhanced activation in the antero- and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex across groups. Healthy women showed a negative coupling between the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and right amygdala, whereas this was absent in patients with BPD.\nSpecificity of results to BPD and sex differences remain unknown owing to the lack of clinical control groups and male participants.\nThe results indicate reduced lateral prefrontal-amygdala communication during emotional action control in anger-prone women with BPD. The findings provide a possible neural mechanism underlying difficulties with controlling emotional impulses in patients with BPD.", "Schizophrenia is a severe global health problem, with over half of such patients experiencing auditory verbal hallucinations (AVHs). A better understanding of the neural correlates differentiating patients experiencing AVHs from patients not experiencing AVHs and healthy controls may identify targets that lead to better treatment strategies for AVHs. Employing 2 data-driven, voxel-based measure of functional connectivity, we studied 46 patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder (28 experiencing AVHs and 18 not experiencing AVHs). Twenty healthy controls matched for age, gender, ethnicity, education level, handedness, and estimated verbal intelligence were included for comparison. The intrinsic connectivity distribution (ICD) was used to model each voxel's connectivity to the rest of the brain using a Weibull distribution. To investigate lateralization of connectivity, we used cross-hemisphere ICD, a method that separates the contribution of each hemisphere to interrogate connectivity laterality. Patients with AVHs compared with patients without AVHs exhibited significantly decreased whole-brain connectivity in the medial prefrontal cortex and posterior cingulate cortex, less lateralized connectivity in left putamen, and more lateralized connectivity in left interior frontal gyrus. Correlations with Auditory Hallucination Rating Scale (AHRS) and post hoc seed connectivity analyses revealed significantly altered network connectivity. Using the results from all analyses comparing the patient groups and correlations with AHRS, we identified a potential AVH network, consisting of 25 nodes, showing substantial overlap with the default mode network and language processing networks. This network as a whole, instead of individual nodes, may represent actionable targets for interventions.", "The original version of this Article contained errors in the affiliations of the authors Ibrahim Numanagi\u0107 and Thomas A.

In some cases, AI learns alone from scratch and performs human tasks faster and better than humans. With the recent advances in AI, it is natural to wonder whether Artificial Neural Networks will be used to successfully create or break cryptographic algorithms. Bibliographic review shows the main approach to this problem have been addressed throughout complex Neural Networks, but without understanding or proving the security of the generated model. This paper presents an analysis of the security of cryptographic algorithms generated by a new technique called Adversarial Neural Cryptography (ANC). Using the proposed network, we show limitations and directions to improve the current approach of ANC. Training the proposed Artificial Neural Network with the improved model of ANC, we show that artificially intelligent agents can learn the unbreakable One-Time Pad (OTP) algorithm, without human knowledge, to communicate securely through an insecure communication channel. This paper shows in which conditions an AI agent can learn a secure encryption scheme. However, it also shows that, without a stronger adversary, it is more likely to obtain an insecure one.", "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD).\n2014.\nThe Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring (ADDM) Network is an active surveillance system that provides estimates of the prevalence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) among children aged 8 years whose parents or guardians reside within 11 ADDM sites in the United States (Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Georgia, Maryland, Minnesota, Missouri, New Jersey, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Wisconsin). ADDM surveillance is conducted in two phases. The first phase involves review and abstraction of comprehensive evaluations that were completed by professional service providers in the community. Staff completing record review and abstraction receive extensive training and supervision and are evaluated according to strict reliability standards to certify effective initial training, identify ongoing training needs, and ensure adherence to the prescribed methodology. Record review and abstraction occurs in a variety of data sources ranging from general pediatric health clinics to specialized programs serving children with developmental disabilities. In addition, most of the ADDM sites also review records for children who have received special education services in public schools. In the second phase of the study, all abstracted information is reviewed systematically by experienced clinicians to determine ASD case status. A child is considered to meet the surveillance case definition for ASD if he or she displays behaviors, as described on one or more comprehensive evaluations completed by community-based professional providers, consistent with the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) diagnostic criteria for autistic disorder; pervasive developmental disorder-not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS, including atypical autism); or Asperger disorder. This report provides updated ASD prevalence estimates for children aged 8 years during the 2014 surveillance year, on the basis of DSM-IV-TR criteria, and describes characteristics of the population of children with ASD. In 2013, the American Psychiatric Association published the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), which made considerable changes to ASD diagnostic criteria. The change in ASD diagnostic criteria might influence ADDM ASD prevalence estimates; therefore, most (85%) of the records used to determine prevalence estimates based on DSM-IV-TR criteria underwent additional review under a newly operationalized surveillance case definition for ASD consistent with the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria. Children meeting this new surveillance case definition could qualify on the basis of one or both of the following criteria, as documented in abstracted comprehensive evaluations: 1) behaviors consistent with the DSM-5 diagnostic features; and/or 2) an ASD diagnosis, whether based on DSM-IV-TR or DSM-5 diagnostic criteria. Stratified comparisons of the number of children meeting either of these two case definitions also are reported.\nFor 2014, the overall prevalence of ASD among the 11 ADDM sites was 16.8 per 1,000 (one in 59) children aged 8 years. Overall ASD prevalence estimates varied among sites, from 13.1-29.3 per 1,000 children aged 8 years. ASD prevalence estimates also varied by sex and race/ethnicity. Males were four times more likely than females to be identified with ASD. Prevalence estimates were higher for non-Hispanic white (henceforth, white) children compared with non-Hispanic black (henceforth, black) children, and both groups were more likely to be identified with ASD compared with Hispanic children. Among the nine sites with sufficient data on intellectual ability, 31% of children with ASD were classified in the range of intellectual disability (intelligence quotient [IQ] <70), 25% were in the borderline range (IQ 71-85), and 44% had IQ scores in the average to above average range (i.e., IQ >85). The distribution of intellectual ability varied by sex and race/ethnicity. Although mention of developmental concerns by age 36 months was documented for 85% of children with ASD, only 42% had a comprehensive evaluation on record by age 36 months. The median age of earliest known ASD diagnosis was 52 months and did not differ significantly by sex or race/ethnicity. For the targeted comparison of DSM-IV-TR and DSM-5 results, the number and characteristics of children meeting the newly operationalized DSM-5 case definition for ASD were similar to those meeting the DSM-IV-TR case definition, with DSM-IV-TR case counts exceeding DSM-5 counts by less than 5% and approximately 86% overlap between the two case definitions (kappa = 0.85).\nFindings from the ADDM Network, on the basis of 2014 data reported from 11 sites, provide updated population-based estimates of the prevalence of ASD among children aged 8 years in multiple communities in the United States. The overall ASD prevalence estimate of 16.8 per 1,000 children aged 8 years in 2014 is higher than previously reported estimates from the ADDM Network. Because the ADDM sites do not provide a representative sample of the entire United States, the combined prevalence estimates presented in this report cannot be generalized to all children aged 8 years in the United States. Consistent with reports from previous ADDM surveillance years, findings from 2014 were marked by variation in ASD prevalence when stratified by geographic area, sex, and level of intellectual ability. Differences in prevalence estimates between black and white children have diminished in most sites, but remained notable for Hispanic children. For 2014, results from application of the DSM-IV-TR and DSM-5 case definitions were similar, overall and when stratified by sex, race/ethnicity, DSM-IV-TR diagnostic subtype, or level of intellectual ability.\nBeginning with surveillance year 2016, the DSM-5 case definition will serve as the basis for ADDM estimates of ASD prevalence in future surveillance reports. Although the DSM-IV-TR case definition will eventually be phased out, it will be applied in a limited geographic area to offer additional data for comparison. Future analyses will examine trends in the continued use of DSM-IV-TR diagnoses, such as autistic disorder, PDD-NOS, and Asperger disorder in health and education records, documentation of symptoms consistent with DSM-5 terminology, and how these trends might influence estimates of ASD prevalence over time. The latest findings from the ADDM Network provide evidence that the prevalence of ASD is higher than previously reported estimates and continues to vary among certain racial/ethnic groups and communities. With prevalence of ASD ranging from 13.1 to 29.3 per 1,000 children aged 8 years in different communities throughout the United States, the need for behavioral, educational, residential, and occupational services remains high, as does the need for increased research on both genetic and nongenetic risk factors for ASD.", "Open-domain conversation is one of the most challenging artificial intelligence problems, which involves language understanding, reasoning, and the utilization of common sense knowledge. The goal of this paper is to further improve the response generation, using personalization criteria. We propose a novel method called PRGDDA (Personalized Response Generation by Dual-learning based Domain Adaptation) which is a personalized response generation model based on theories of domain adaptation and dual learning. During the training procedure, PRGDDA first learns the human responding style from large general data (without user-specific information), and then fine-tunes the model on a small size of personalized data to generate personalized conversations with a dual learning mechanism. We conduct experiments to verify the effectiveness of the proposed model on two real-world datasets in both English and Chinese. Experimental results show that our model can generate better personalized responses for different users.", "Placebo effects have often been attributed to cognitive processes described as \"learning\" and/or \"expectancy,\" yet the role of conscious awareness is unclear. Furthermore, little is known about the placebo effects in patients with limited cognitive abilities, such as intellectual disability. Here, recent data on placebo mechanisms in patients with impaired cognitive function will be discussed, as well as experimental studies investigating how implicit cognitive processes may shape placebo effects. Together these studies comment on the minimum requirements in order to elicit placebo effects, both from the view of conscious awareness and from the perspective of Intelligence Quotient and basic brain function. Together with recent conceptualizations of placebo effects in terms of predictive coding, there is evidence to suggest that placebo effects are fundamental responses of the brain that have developed to promote survival.", "Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and schizophrenia share common features in terms of pathophysiology and clinical appearance. Cognitive deficits are also present in both disorders. However, ASD and schizophrenia are heterogeneous syndromes, and\u00a0 few\u00a0 studies\u00a0 have addressed patients with these disorders who have above average educational attainment. In this study, we assessed the cognitive functions of a group of adult ASD patients with adequate mental development and verbal communication skills (High Functioning Autism, HFA) and compared them with a group of Schizophrenia patients matched for level of education.\nThree groups of patients and controls [(HFA, n= 32), Schizophrenia (n= 17), Controls (n= 23)], all with at least a high school education, were assessed with the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS), Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST), and Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT). For the assessment of HFA, scores on the Autism Spectrum Disorders in Adults Screening Questionnaire were taken into consideration. Clinical diagnoses were based on DSM-IV TR and DSM-5 criteria.\nHigh Functioning Autism and Schizophrenia groups performed similarly in all subtests except for WAIS Comprehension and Digit Symbol, WCST Perseveration, and RAVLT Learning.\nComprehension abilities of educated adults with HFA could be higher than average in situations that do not involve social interaction. Tendency to perseveration in the presence of adequate concept formation ability may reflect the clinical symptoms of rigidity and repetitive behavior. In patients with higher levels of functioning and education, their diagnosis appears to be weakly associated with cognitive functioning. The potential roles of other variables, such as environmental factors, during development deserve further exploration in future studies.", "Contemporary health care services are more productive and successful when their health professionals have emotional intelligence (EI). The objective of this study was to explore the demographic predictors of EI among radiation therapists working in cancer care centres in NSW, Australia.\nData were collected using a cross-sectional self-administered survey. Emotional intelligence was measured using the Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire- Short version (TEIQue - SF). Multiple regression analysis was used to identify if age, years of experience, gender, highest level of education obtained or level of current employment were predictors of EI.\nA total of 205 radiation therapists participated in this study. The mean scores for Global EI, emotionality, self-control, wellbeing and sociability dimensions were 5.16 (SD = 0.6), 5.3 (SD = 0.7), 4.9 (SD = 0.9), 5.7 (SD = 0.8) and 4.7 (SD = 0.8) respectively. Age and level of current employment were identified as predictors of global EI. Gender and level of education were significant predictors of the EI emotionality dimension. Levels of employment along with level of education were both significant predictors of the sociability dimension of EI.\nBeing a young radiation therapist, female, and having higher levels of employment and higher levels of education were predictors of EI. Given that level of education and level of employment are both amendable demographic factors, strategies to address these factors to reduce the effects of emotional struggle experienced by radiation therapists in their work need to be implemented.", "Overdiagnosis, more than an error regarding the diagnosis, is an error regarding the prognosis. We cannot know what consequences some lesions that we detect by imaging would have on our patients' lives if they were left untreated. As long as it is not possible for imaging techniques to differentiate between lesions that will have an indolent course from those that will have an aggressive course, there will be overdiagnosis. Advanced imaging techniques, radiomics, and radiogenomics, together with artificial intelligence, promise advances in this sense. In the meantime, it is important that radiologists be careful to ensure that only strictly necessary imaging tests are done. Moreover, we need to participate, together with patients, in making multidisciplinary decisions about diagnosis and clinical management. Finally, of course, we need to continue to contribute to the technological and scientific advance of our profession, so that we can continue to improve the diagnosis and early detection of abnormalities, especially those that require treatment.", "Emotional intelligence in nursing is of global interest. International studies identify that emotional intelligence influences nurses' work and relationships with patients. It is associated with compassion and care. Nursing students scored higher on measures of emotional intelligence compared to students of other study programmes. The level of emotional intelligence increases with age and tends to be higher in women.\nThis study aims to measure the differences in emotional intelligence between nursing students with previous caring experience and those without; to examine the effects of gender on emotional intelligence scores; and to test whether nursing students score higher than engineering colleagues on emotional intelligence measures.\nA cross-sectional descriptive study design was used.\nThe study included 113 nursing and 104 engineering students at the beginning of their first year of study at a university in Slovenia.\nEmotional intelligence was measured using the Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire (TEIQue) and Schutte Self Report Emotional Intelligence Test (SSEIT).\nShapiro-Wilk's test of normality was used to test the sample distribution, while the differences in mean values were tested using Student t-test of independent samples.\nEmotional intelligence was higher in nursing students (n\u202f=\u202f113) than engineering students (n\u202f=\u202f104) in both measures [TEIQue t\u202f=\u202f3.972; p\u202f<\u202f0.001; SSEIT t\u202f=\u202f8.288; p\u202f<\u202f0.001]. Although nursing female students achieved higher emotional intelligence scores than male students on both measures, the difference was not statistically significant [TEIQue t\u202f=\u202f-0.839; p\u202f=\u202f0.403; SSEIT t\u202f=\u202f-1.159; p\u202f=\u202f0.249]. EI scores in nursing students with previous caring experience were not higher compared to students without such experience for any measure [TEIQue t\u202f=\u202f-1.633; p\u202f=\u202f0.105; SSEIT t\u202f=\u202f-0.595; p\u202f=\u202f0.553].\nEmotional intelligence was higher in nursing than engineering students, and slightly higher in women than men. It was not associated with previous caring experience.", "With the increasing prevalence in myopia there is growing interest in active myopia prevention. This study aims to increase our understanding of parental attitudes to myopia development and control, as a means to inform future health planning and policy. It evaluates, for the first time, the attitude of parents to myopia and its associated risks, as well as assessing the exposure of Irish children to environmental factors that may influence their risk profile for myopia development.\nParents of 8-13\u00a0year old children in eight participating schools completed a questionnaire designed to assess their knowledge of and attitudes towards myopia and its risk factors. A structured diary was also used to capture daily activities of children in relation to myopia risk factors.\nOf 329 parents, just 46% considered that myopia presented a health risk to their children, while an identical number (46%) regarded it as an optical inconvenience. Myopia was also, but less frequently, considered an expense (31% of parents), a cosmetic inconvenience (14% of parents) and, by some, as a sign of intelligence (4% of parents) 76% of parents recognised the potential of digital technology to impact the eye, particularly as a cause of eyestrain and need for spectacles. Only 14% of parents expressed concern should their child be diagnosed with myopia. Compared to non myopic parents, myopic parents viewed myopia as more of an optical inconvenience (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), an expense (p\u00a0<\u00a00.005) and a cosmetic inconvenience (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). There was a trend for myopic parents to limit screen time use in their household more than non-myopic parents (p\u00a0=\u00a00.05). Parents who considered myopia a health risk sought to limit screen time more than parents who did not regard myopia as a health risk to their child (p\u00a0=\u00a00.01). Children spent significantly longer performing indoor proximal tasks (255\u00a0min) compared to time spent outdoors (180\u00a0min; p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) daily. Older (p\u00a0=\u00a00.001), urban (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0005) myopic (=0.04) children spent significantly more time at digital screens compared to younger non-myopic children from a rural background.\nParental attitudes to myopia were typically nonchalant in relation to health risk. This is of particular concern given the impact parents have on children's behaviour and choices with respect to such risk factors, demonstrating an acute need for societal sensitisation to the public health importance of myopia.", "The purpose of this study was to examine the role of staff nurse emotional intelligence between transformational leadership and nurse intent to stay.\nNurse intent to stay and transformational leadership are widely recognized as vital components of nurse retention. Staff nurse emotional intelligence that has been confirmed improvable has been recently recognized in the nursing literature as correlated with retention. Yet, the nature of the relationships among these three variables is not known.\nCross-sectional data for 535 Chinese nurses were analysed using Structural Equation Modelling.\nTransformational leadership and staff nurse emotional intelligence were significant predictors of nurse intent to stay, accounting for 34.3% of the variance in nurse intent to stay. Staff nurse emotional intelligence partially mediates the relationship between transformational leadership and nurse intent to stay.\nThe findings of the study emphasized the importance of transformational leadership in enhancing nurse emotional intelligence and to provide a deeper understanding of the mediating role of emotional intelligence in the relationship between nurse manager's transformational leadership and nurse's intent to stay.\nNurse leaders should develop training programmes to improve nursing manager transformational leadership and staff nurse emotional intelligence in the workplace.", "Copy number variants (CNVs) are associated with psychiatric conditions in clinical populations. The relationship between rare CNV burden and neuropsychiatric traits in young, general populations is underexplored. A total of 6,807 children from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) were studied. CNVs were inferred from single nucleotide polymorphism-array data using PennCNV. After excluding children with known candidate CNVs for schizophrenia (SCZ), rare (<1%) CNV burden (total number of genes affected by CNVs, total length of CNVs, and largest CNV carried) was analyzed in relation to: psychotic experiences (PEs) and anxiety/depression in adolescence; autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), ASD and ADHD traits, and cognitive measures during childhood. Outcomes were also assessed in relation to known SCZ CNVs. The number of genes affected by rare CNVs was associated with a continuous measure of ASD: the standardized mean difference [SMD] per gene affected was increased by 0.018 [95%CI 0.011,0.025], p\u2009=\u20093e-07 for duplications and by 0.021 [95%CI 0.010, 0.032], p\u2009=\u20091e-04 for deletions. In line with our published results on educational attainment in ALSPAC, intelligence quotient (IQ) was associated with CNV burden: the SMD per gene affected was -0.017 [95%CI -0.025, -0.008] p\u2009=\u20091e-04 for duplications and -0.023 [95%CI -0.037, -0.009], p\u2009=\u2009.002 for deletions. Associations were also observed for measures of coherence, attention, memory, and social cognition. SCZ-associated deletions were associated with IQ (SMD: -0.617 [95%CI -0.936, -0.298], p\u2009=\u20092e-04), but not with PEs or other traits. We found that rare CNV burden and known SCZ candidate CNVs are associated with neuropsychiatric phenotypes in a nonclinically ascertained sample of young people.", "Young children often use magical explanations to account for ordinary phenomena (e.g., \"The sun's not out today because it is mad\"). We labeled these explanations supernatural thinking. Previous research reports that supernatural thinking attributed to preschool-age children evokes both positive affect and perceptions of helplessness from both adults and older (14-17 years old) but not younger (10-13 years old) adolescents. In this study, we asked if cues of cognitive immaturity are more influential in affecting adolescents' judgments of children than physical cues (faces).\n245 adolescents aged between 10 and 17 rated pairs of children who physically and/or cognitively resembled either a 4- to 7-year-old or an 8- to 10-year-old child in three between-subject conditions (Consistent, Inconsistent, Faces-Only) for 14 traits classified into four trait dimensions (Positive Affect, Negative Affect, Intelligence, Helplessness).\nFor both younger and older adolescents, cognitive cues had a greater influence on judgments than facial cues. However, only the older adolescents demonstrated a positive bias for children expressing immature supernatural thinking.\nAdopting an evolutionary developmental perspective, we interpreted this outcome in late (but not early) adolescence as preparation for potential parenthood.", "This article was presented at the 2017 annual meeting of the American Association of Hip and Knee Surgeons to introduce the members gathered as the audience to the concepts behind artificial intelligence (AI) and the applications that AI can have in the world of health care today. We discuss the origin of AI, progress to machine learning, and then discuss how the limits of machine learning lead data scientists to develop artificial neural networks and deep learning algorithms through biomimicry. We will place all these technologies in the context of practical clinical examples and show how AI can act as a tool to support and amplify human cognitive functions for physicians delivering care to increasingly complex patients. The aim of this article is to provide the reader with a basic understanding of the fundamentals of AI. Its purpose is to demystify this technology for practicing surgeons so they can better understand how and where to apply it.", "This paper focuses on the ethical challenges presented by direct-to-consumer (DTC) digital psychotherapy services that do not involve oversight by a professional mental health provider. DTC digital psychotherapy services can potentially assist in improving access to mental health care for the many people who would otherwise not have the resources or ability to connect with a therapist. However, the lack of adequate regulation in this area exacerbates concerns over how safety, privacy, accountability, and other ethical obligations to protect an individual in therapy are addressed within these services. In the traditional therapeutic relationship, there are ethical obligations that serve to protect the interests of the client and provide warnings. In contrast, in a DTC therapy app, there are no clear lines of accountability or associated ethical obligations to protect the user seeking mental health services. The types of DTC services that present ethical challenges include apps that use a digital platform to connect users to minimally trained nonprofessional counselors, as well as services that provide counseling steered by artificial intelligence and conversational agents. There is a need for adequate oversight of DTC nonprofessional psychotherapy services and additional empirical research to inform policy that will provide protection to the consumer.", "Exposure of pregnant women to fine particulate matter<2.5\u03bcm in diameter (PM2.5) is responsible for low birthweight (LBW) and intellectual disabilities, as expressed by a lower intelligence quotient (IQ). We estimated the attributable cost due to PM2.5 of healthcare at birth and cognitive retardation of children with LBW in metropolitan France in 2012. The cost of specific care of the 8300 (range, 3100-13,300) children born every year in France with a LBW attributable to PM2.5 exposure is estimated at \u20ac25 million (range, \u20ac 9.5-39 million). Among these 8300 children, 1880 will present an intelligence quotient (IQ) lower than the average of the general population. The annual cost of the care of these intellectual deficiencies attributable to PM2.5 is estimated at \u20ac15 million and that of the mental handicap on the lifespan of the LBW children born in 2012 attributable to PM2.5 is estimated at \u20ac1.2 billion (range, \u20ac458 million to \u20ac1.9 billion). Beyond the elevated costs borne by future generations and the intellectual impoverishment of our society, it is essential to provide continued minimal monitoring of pregnant women exposed to air pollution. For the decision-makers, it is urgent to take effective measures and actions to protect the health of exposed populations.", "Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is one of the leading causes of vision loss globally with a severe burden on all societies due to its high treatment and rehabilitation costs. The early diagnosis of DR may provide preventive steps (including retinal laser therapy and tight carbohydrate, blood pressure, and cholesterol control) that could in turn help to avoid progression of the pathology with the resultant vision loss. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) enables the in vivo structural imaging of the retina, providing both qualitative (structure) and quantitative (thickness) information. In the past decades, extensive OCT research has been done in the field of DR. In the present review, we are focusing on those that were aiming at detection of the earliest retinal changes before DR could be diagnosed funduscopically. The latest, widely available technology of spectral-domain (SD-)OCT comes with a fast and reliable retinal imaging, which, together with the most recent developments in image processing and artificial intelligence, holds the promise of developing a quick and efficient, state-of-the-art screening tool for DR.\nDiabetische Retinopathie (DR) ist eine der f\u00fchrenden Ursachen des Sehverlustes weltweit und stellt wegen der hohen Behandlungs- und Rehabilitationskosten eine hohe Belastung f\u00fcr alle Gesellschaftsebenen dar. Durch eine fr\u00fch gestellte Diagnose der DR kann die Feineinstellung von Blutzucker, Blutdruck und Cholesterin erzielt und eine fr\u00fchzeitige Laserbehandlung der Netzhaut durchgef\u00fchrt werden, welche die Progression und den dadurch auftretenden Sehverlust vermeiden. Die optische Koh\u00e4renztomografie (OCT) ist ein bildgebendes Verfahren, mit welchem die Netzhautstruktur in vivo dargestellt werden kann und das wichtige qualitative (Struktur) und quantitative (Dicke) Informationen \u00fcber die Netzhaut liefert. In der letzten Zeit wurde Vieles im Bereich der OCT-Diagnostik von diabetischer Retinopathie erforscht. In unserem Review wollen wir uns auf die fr\u00fchestm\u00f6gliche Diagnosestellung mithilfe der OCT-Technologie fokussieren. Die neueste, auf dem Markt weitgehend erh\u00e4ltliche Spektral-Dom\u00e4nen-OCT-Technologie (SD-OCT) bietet ein schnelles und genaues Imaging der Netzhaut, das zusammen mit den neuesten Entwicklungen im Bereich Bildbearbeitung und k\u00fcnstlicher Intelligenz sehr vielversprechend in Bezug auf ein schnelles und effizientes Screening der fr\u00fchen diabetischen Retinopathie ist.", "Chronic diseases are the leading cause of death worldwide. It is well understood that if modifiable risk factors are targeted, most chronic diseases can be prevented. Lifetime health is an emerging health paradigm that aims to assist individuals to achieve desired health targets, and avoid harmful lifecycle choices to mitigate the risk of chronic diseases. Early risk identification is central to lifetime health. In this paper, we present a digital health-based platform (PRISM) that leverages artificial intelligence, data visualization and mobile health technologies to empower citizens to self-assess, self-monitor and self-manage their overall risk of major chronic diseases and pursue personalized chronic disease prevention programs. PRISM offers risk assessment tools for 5 chronic conditions, 2 psychiatric disorders and 8 different cancers.", "Recent progress in deep learning extends the capability of artificial intelligence to various practical tasks, making the deep neural network (DNN) an extremely versatile hypothesis. While such DNN is virtually built on contemporary data centers of the von Neumann architecture, physical (in part) DNN of non-von Neumann architecture, also known as neuromorphic computing, can remarkably improve learning and inference efficiency. Particularly, resistance-based nonvolatile random access memory (NVRAM) highlights its handy and efficient application to the multiply-accumulate (MAC) operation in an analog manner. Here, an overview is given of the available types of resistance-based NVRAMs and their technological maturity from the material- and device-points of view. Examples within the strategy are subsequently addressed in comparison with their benchmarks (virtual DNN in deep learning). A spiking neural network (SNN) is another type of neural network that is more biologically plausible than the DNN. The successful incorporation of resistance-based NVRAM in SNN-based neuromorphic computing offers an efficient solution to the MAC operation and spike timing-based learning in nature. This strategy is exemplified from a material perspective. Intelligent machines are categorized according to their architecture and learning type. Also, the functionality and usefulness of NVRAM-based neuromorphic computing are addressed.", "Artificial intelligence has been able to automatically learn and judge large-scale data to some extent. Based on database of a large amount of burn data and in-depth learning, artificial intelligence can assist burn surgeons to evaluate burn surface, diagnose burn depth, guide fluid supply during shock stage, and predict prognosis, with high accuracy. With the development of technology, artificial intelligence can provide more accurate information for burn surgeons to make clinical diagnosis and treatment strategies.", "Power lines are extending to complex environments (e.g., lakes and forests), and the distribution of power lines in a tower is becoming complicated (e.g., multi-loop and multi-bundle). Additionally, power line inspection is becoming heavier and more difficult. Advanced LiDAR technology is increasingly being used to solve these difficulties. Based on precise cable inspection robot (CIR) LiDAR data and the distinctive position and orientation system (POS) data, we propose a novel methodology to detect inspection objects surrounding power lines. The proposed method mainly includes four steps: firstly, the original point cloud is divided into single-span data as a processing unit; secondly, the optimal elevation threshold is constructed to remove ground points without the existing filtering algorithm, improving data processing efficiency and extraction accuracy; thirdly, a single power line and its surrounding data can be respectively extracted by a structured partition based on a POS data (SPPD) algorithm from \"layer\" to \"block\" according to power line distribution; finally, a partition recognition method is proposed based on the distribution characteristics of inspection objects, highlighting the feature information and improving the recognition effect. The local neighborhood statistics and the 3D region growing method are used to recognize different inspection objects surrounding power lines in a partition. Three datasets were collected by two CIR LIDAR systems in our study. The experimental results demonstrate that an average 90.6% accuracy and average 98.2% precision at the point cloud level can be achieved. The successful extraction indicates that the proposed method is feasible and promising. Our study can be used to obtain precise dimensions of fittings for modeling, as well as automatic detection and location of security risks, so as to improve the intelligence level of power line inspection.", "Jared Diamond's argument against extraterrestrial intelligence from evolutionary contingency is subjected to critical scrutiny. As with the earlier arguments of George Gaylord Simpson, it contains critical loopholes that lead to its unraveling. From the point of view of the contemporary debates about biological evolution, perhaps the most contentious aspect of such arguments is their atemporal and gradualist usage of the space of all possible biological forms (morphospace). Such usage enables the translation of the adaptive value of a trait into the probability of its evolving. This procedure, it is argued, is dangerously misleading. Contra Diamond, there are reasons to believe that convergence not only plays an important role in the history of life, but also profoundly improves the prospects for search for extraterrestrial intelligence success. Some further considerations about the role of observation selection effects and our scaling of complexity in the great debate about contingency and convergence are given. Taken together, these considerations militate against the pessimism of Diamond's conclusion, and suggest that the search for traces and manifestations of extraterrestrial intelligences is far from forlorn.

Since, self-care problems classification is a time-consuming process and requires expert occupational therapists, using an expert system in classifying these problems can decrease cost and time, efficiently. Expert systems refer to the systems that are based on artificial intelligence methods, which have the ability to learn, infer, and predict. In order to configure and train an expert system, a standard dataset is critical for the learning phase. Hence, in this research, a new standard dataset called SCADI (Self-Care Activities Dataset based on ICF-CY) is introduced innovatively. SCADI is based on ICF-CY, which is a conceptual framework, released by the World Health Organization. According to the best of our knowledge, SCADI is the first standard dataset in the self-care activates based on ICF-CY in which 29 self-care activities are considered. In this research, to show the applicability of SCADI in the expert systems, two different types of expert systems are proposed for the self-care problems classification of children with physical and motor disability. In the first expert system, an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is employed as a classifier. This classifier is trained by using SCADI during the learning process. Since ANNs do not provide any explanation for the inference rules and manners, in the second expert system, to evaluate the applicability of SCADI in the rule-based systems, C4.5, a popular decision tree algorithm is used to extract self-care problems classification rules precisely. The experiment results show that the ANN-based system has high accuracy in self-care problems classification, which is 83.1% and SCADI has the high applicability to be employed in the different classification systems such as neural networks and rule-based systems.", "There have been many attempts to incorporate automation into the practice of anesthesiology, though none have been successful. Fundamentally, these failures are due to the underlying complexity of anesthesia practice and the inability of rule-based feedback loops to fully master it. Recent innovations in artificial intelligence, especially machine learning, may usher in a new era of automation across many industries, including anesthesiology. It would be wise to consider the implications of such potential changes before they have been fully realized.", "This work introduces a revised version of the Food Sustainability Index, proposed by the Economist Intelligence Unit and the Barilla Center for Food and Nutrition in 2016. Our Adjusted Food Sustainability Index features two important advantages: 1) it employs the Mazziotta-Pareto method to compute weights, hence granting an objective aggregation criterion and 2) it does not take policy variables into account, thus focusing on the status quo. The policy variables are aggregated into the Policy Index, measuring the quality of the food sustainability policies. We compute the two indices for 25 countries worldwide, then we use the Data Envelopment Analysis to evaluate policy efficiency. Our results show that country-level variation in policy efficiency is wide and policies affect food sustainability significantly, especially when they target nutritional challenges.", "Executive dysfunctions frequently occur in patients with Major Depressive Disorder and have been shown to improve during effective antidepressant treatment. However, the time course of improvement and its relationship to treatment outcome is unknown. The aim of the study was to assess the test performance and clinical outcome by repetitive assessments of executive test procedures during antidepressant treatment. Executive test performance was assessed in 209 -patients with Major Depressive Disorder (mean age 39.3 \u00b1 11.4 years) and 84 healthy controls five times in biweekly intervals from baseline to week 8. Patients were treated by a defined treatment algorithm within the early medication change study (EMC trial; ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00974155), controls did not receive any intervention. Cognitive domains were processing speed, cognitive flexibility, phonemic and semantic verbal fluency. Intelligence was assessed at baseline. Depression severity was tested once a week by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD17). 130 patients (62%) showed executive dysfunctions in at least one of four tests at baseline. Linear mixed regression models revealed that the course of depression severity was associated to the course of cognitive flexibility (p = 0.004) and semantic verbal fluency (p = 0.020). Cognitive flexibility and semantic verbal fluency may be candidates easily to apply for therapy response prediction in clinical routine, which should be tested in further prospective studies.\nClinicalTrials.gov NCT00974155 EudraCT: 2008-008280-96.", "Previous meta-analyses have shown a moderate negative impact of maltreatment on the neuropsychological functioning of people with or without psychiatric disorders compared to healthy groups. The objectives of the present meta-analysis were to (1) investigate the impact of maltreatment on neuropsychological functioning of people with psychiatric disorders and to (2) evaluate the moderating effect of age, at the time of the cognitive assessment, on neuropsychological functioning.\nSeventeen studies published between 1970 and July 2017 were included.\nThe results showed a negative impact of maltreatment with a small effect size (g\u2009=\u2009-0.25) on the neuropsychological performances in the group with psychiatric disorders with a history of exposure to childhood maltreatment compared to the group with psychiatric disorders without a history of exposure to childhood maltreatment. Cognitive domains that are significantly affected by maltreatment are: working memory (g\u2009=\u2009-0.56), verbal episodic memory (g\u2009=\u2009-0.39), intelligence (g\u2009=\u2009-0.27) and processing speed (g\u2009=\u2009-0.21). The impact of childhood maltreatment on the cognitive profile is greater in adults than young people.\nClinicians should consider these common cognitive deficits using a transdiagnostic approach in cognitive interventions.", "we sought to determine the degree to which cognitive reserve, as assessed by the Test of Premorbid Functioning in combination with demographic variables, could act as a buffer against the effect of traumatic brain injury (TBI) on cognitive test performance.\nretrospective analysis of a cohort of 121 persons with TBI who completed the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Fourth Edition (WAIS-IV) within 1-12 months after injury.\nregression analyses indicated that cognitive reserve was a statistically significant predictor of all postinjury WAIS-IV factor index scores, after controlling for various premorbid and comorbid confounding variables. Only for Processing Speed did injury severity make an additional statistically significant contribution to the prediction model.\ncognitive reserve has a protective effect with regard to the impact of TBI on cognitive test performance but this effect is imperfect and does not completely negate the effect of injury severity.", "Recently, the exponential increase in compute requirements demanded by emerging applications like artificial intelligence, Internet of things, etc. have rendered the state-of-art von-Neumann machines inefficient in terms of energy and throughput owing to the well-known von-Neumann bottleneck. A promising approach to mitigate the bottleneck is to do computations as close to the memory units as possible. One extreme possibility is to do in-situ Boolean logic computations by using stateful devices. Stateful devices are those that can act both as a compute engine and storage device, simultaneously. We propose such stateful, vector, in-memory operations using voltage controlled magnetic anisotropy (VCMA) effect in magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJ). Our proposal is based on the well known manufacturable 1-transistor - 1-MTJ bit-cell and does not require any modifications in the bit-cell circuit or the magnetic device. Instead, we leverage the very physics of the VCMA effect to enable stateful computations. Specifically, we exploit the voltage asymmetry of the VCMA effect to construct stateful IMP (implication) gate and use the precessional switching dynamics of the VCMA devices to propose a massively parallel NOT operation. Further, we show that other gates like AND, OR, NAND, NOR, NIMP (complement of implication) can be implemented using multi-cycle operations.", "Although ubiquitous on accident scenes, the polymers from headlight optics are often neglected in hit-and-run cases, and their evidential value restrained to direct comparison once a corresponding vehicle is found. Multilayered automotive paint fragments are preferred for their access to corresponding databases (PDQ, EUCAP) to infer models and brands of cars. The potential of polymers headlights for providing forensic intelligence has never been exploited, principally due to the lack of diversity, of appropriate databases, and of case examples. The motives are very simple however. Headlight polymers suffer from a lack of differentiation, and about 90% of them are composed of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA). The discriminating powers using techniques in sequence typically range from 30 to 60%. In this paper, we take advantage of the extreme sensitivity of Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS) to analyze the dye composition of the polymer headlights. The measurements by standard Raman spectroscopy at 488, 633, and 785nm permits us to identify the polymer type with relative ease. 51 out of 53 samples are composed of PMMA, the two remaining being either Polycarbonate or Polybutylene terephthalate. Additionally, using SERS with silver colloids at 488 and 633nm, provides enhanced spectra of the dyes used in the composition with an extreme sensitivity and specificity. With SERS we are able to differentiate the majority of the headlights with a remarkable 90-100% discriminating power. Solvent Orange 60, Solvent Red 52 and Solvent Red 111 were successfully identified as dyes used in the manufacture of the headlights. These results demonstrate that a combined Raman-SERS approach has the potential to replace an otherwise lengthy sequence of many different analytical techniques. With one single instrument, we offer the possibility to combine an analysis of the polymer type, and of the dye components with high discriminating capabilities. These results open up new opportunities for exploiting headlight plastics in road accidents investigations. It has the potential to help in source attribution, and/or database building in a forensic intelligence perspective.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly moving from an experimental phase to an implementation phase in many fields, including medicine. The combination of improved availability of large datasets, increasing computing power, and advances in learning algorithms has created major performance breakthroughs in the development of AI applications. In the last 5\u00a0years, AI techniques known as deep learning have delivered rapidly improving performance in image recognition, caption generation, and speech recognition. Radiology, in particular, is a prime candidate for early adoption of these techniques. It is anticipated that the implementation of AI in radiology over the next decade will significantly improve the quality, value, and depth of radiology's contribution to patient care and population health, and will revolutionize radiologists' workflows. The Canadian Association of Radiologists (CAR) is the national voice of radiology committed to promoting the highest standards in patient-centered imaging, lifelong learning, and research. The CAR has created an AI working group with the mandate to discuss and deliberate on practice, policy, and patient care issues related to the introduction and implementation of AI in imaging. This white paper provides recommendations for the CAR derived from deliberations between members of the AI working group. This white paper on AI in radiology will inform CAR members and policymakers on key terminology, educational needs of members, research and development, partnerships, potential clinical applications, implementation, structure and governance, role of radiologists, and potential impact of AI on radiology in Canada.", "Accurate and immediate diagnosis of malaria is important for medication of the infectious disease. Conventional methods for diagnosing malaria are time consuming and rely on the skill of experts. Therefore, an automatic and simple diagnostic modality is essential for healthcare in developing countries that lack the expertise of trained microscopists. In the present study, a new automatic sensing method using digital in-line holographic microscopy (DIHM) combined with machine learning algorithms was proposed to sensitively detect unstained malaria-infected red blood cells (iRBCs). To identify the RBC characteristics, 13 descriptors were extracted from segmented holograms of individual RBCs. Among the 13 descriptors, 10 features were highly statistically different between healthy RBCs (hRBCs) and iRBCs. Six machine learning algorithms were applied to effectively combine the dominant features and to greatly improve the diagnostic capacity of the present method. Among the classification models trained by the 6 tested algorithms, the model trained by the support vector machine (SVM) showed the best accuracy in separating hRBCs and iRBCs for training (n\u2009=\u2009280, 96.78%) and testing sets (n\u2009=\u2009120, 97.50%). This DIHM-based artificial intelligence methodology is simple and does not require blood staining. Thus, it will be beneficial and valuable in the diagnosis of malaria.", "There is a need for novel treatment approaches in anorexia nervosa (AN). While there is broad knowledge with regard to altered appetite regulation and neuropsychological deficits in AN patients on the one hand, and the effects of estrogen replacement upon neuropsychological performance in healthy subjects on the other, up to now, no study has implemented estrogen replacement in AN patients, in order to examine its effects upon AN-associated and general psychopathology, neuropsychological performance and concentrations of peptide components of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and within appetite-regulating circuits.\nThis is a randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial on the effects of a 10-week oral estrogen replacement (combination of ethinyl estradiol 0.03\u00a0mg and dienogest 2\u00a0mg) in adult female AN patients. The primary target is the assessment of the impact of sex hormone replacement upon neuropsychological performance by means of a neuropsychological test battery consisting of a test for verbal intelligence, the Trail making test A and B, a Go/No-go paradigm with food cues and the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test. Secondary targets include a) the examination of safety and tolerability (as mirrored by the number of adverse events), b) assessments of the impact upon eating disorder-specific psychopathology by means of the Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire (EDE-Q) and the Eating Disorder Inventory-2 (EDI-2), c) the influence upon anxiety using the State-Trait-Anxiety Inventory (STAI), d) assessments of plasma cortisol levels during a dexamethasone-suppression test and appetite-regulating plasma peptides (ghrelin, leptin, insulin, glucose) during an oral glucose tolerance test and, e) a possible impact upon the prescription of antidepressants.\nThis is the first study of its kind. There are no evidence-based psychopharmacological options for the treatment of AN. Thus, the results of this clinical trial may have a relevant impact on future treatment regimens. Novel approaches are necessary to improve rates of AN symptom remission and increase the rapidity of treatment response. Identifying the underlying biological (e.g. neuroendocrinological) factors that maintain AN or may predict patient treatment response represent critical future research directions. Continued efforts to incorporate novel pharmacological aspects into treatments will increase access to evidence-based care and help reduce the burden of AN.\nEuropean Clinical Trials Database, EudraCT number 2015-004184-36, registered November 2015; ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03172533 , retrospectively registered May 2017.", "Kanazawa and Still (2018) showed that very unattractive workers earned more than unattractive workers, sometimes more than average-looking or attractive workers, because they had higher levels of intelligence and education, but they did not explain why very unattractive workers had higher intelligence and education. There are both theoretical and empirical reasons to expect that some intelligent men may prefer to marry very unattractive women. The analysis of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) shows that very unattractive women were significantly more likely to be married at Age 29 than unattractive or average-looking women, and their spouses or partners earned significantly more than those of unattractive or average-looking women. If intelligent men have historically preferred to marry very unattractive women generation after generation, then, because both general intelligence and physical attractiveness are highly heritable, this can explain why very unattractive workers are more intelligent and achieve higher education, thereby earning more. It can also explain why the positive correlation between intelligence and physical attractiveness is not larger despite assortative mating of intelligent men of higher status and physically attractive women over many generations.", "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder affecting millions of people worldwide. Laboratory research and longitudinal clinical studies have helped to reveal various information about the disease but the exact causal process is not known yet. Patterns from alteration of neurochemicals (e.g., glutathione depletion, etc.), hippocampal atrophy, and brain effective connectivity loss as well as associated behavioral changes have generated important characteristic features. These imaging-based readouts and neuropsychological outcomes along with supervised clinical review are critical for developing a comprehensive artificial intelligence strategy for early predictive AD diagnosis and therapeutic development.", "Despite several studies that have highlighted the harmful effects of alcohol consumption on cognitive functions it remains unclear whether certain brain areas are more sensitive than others are or whether alcohol causes widespread cognitive deficit. Moreover, the role of continued abstinence has yet to be clarified regarding the quality of recovery on the different cognitive domains. The aim of this 1-year longitudinal study was to evaluate the recovery of cognitive deficits in the medium (6 months) and long term (12 months) after the interruption of drinking.\nForty-one alcohol-dependent patients were recruited from two outpatient treatment facilities and cognitive functions were compared on a control group of forty healthy controls. The patients were then re-assessed at 6 and 12 months. Changes in neuropsychological measures were evaluated with repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). We also compared 1-year follow-up scores with control data (unpaired t tests) to identify tests on which significant differences persisted.\nPatients performed significantly worse than controls in all cognitive domains investigated and this cognitive impairment was evident in recently abstinent patients. A year of abstinence resulted in a significant improvement in all cognitive domains assessed after detoxification from alcohol. After year 1, alcoholic subjects had returned to normal levels compared to healthy controls on all domains except for general non-verbal intelligence, verbal memory and some visuospatial skills.\nOur results support the hypothesis of widespread impairment resulting from alcohol consumption. The recovery of cognitive functions is not homogeneous during prolonged abstinence.", "Benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (BECTS) does not always have a benign cognitive outcome. We investigated the relationship between cognitive performance and altered functional connectivity (FC) in the resting-state brain networks of BECTS patients.\nWe studied 42 subjects, comprising 19 BECTS patients and 23 healthy controls. Cognitive performance was assessed using the Korean version of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-III, in addition to verbal and visuospatial memory tests and executive function tests. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging was acquired in addition to high-resolution structural data. We selected Rolandic and language-related areas as regions of interest (ROIs) and analyzed the seed-based FC to voxels throughout the brain. We evaluated the correlations between the neuropsychological test scores and seed-based FC values using the same ROIs.\nThe verbal intelligence quotient (VIQ) and full-scale intelligence quotient (FSIQ) were lower in BECTS patients than in healthy controls (p<0.001). The prevalence of subjects with a higher performance IQ than VIQ was significantly higher in BECTS patients than in healthy controls (73.7% vs. 26.1%, respectively; p=0.002). Both the Rolandic and language-related ROIs exhibited more enhanced FC to voxels in the left inferior temporal gyrus in BECTS patients than in healthy controls. A particularly interestingly finding was that the enhanced FC was correlated with lower cognitive performance as measured by the VIQ and the FSIQ in both patients and control subjects.\nOur findings suggest that the FC alterations in resting-state brain networks related to the seizure onset zone and language processing areas could be related to adaptive plasticity for coping with cognitive dysfunction.", "This study reports a case of a 4-year-old boy patient with abnormalities of muscle tone, movement and motor skills, as well as unstable gait leading to frequent falls. The results of the electroencephalogram (EEG) indicate moderately abnormal EEG, accompanied by irregular seizures. Based on these clinical characteristics, the patient was diagnosed with cerebral palsy (CP) in our hospital. In this study, the patient was treated with umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell (UC-MSC) transplantation therapy. This patient received UC-MSC transplantation 3 times (5.3*107) in total. After three successive cell transplantations, the patient recovered well and showed obvious improvements in EEG and limb strength, motor function, and language expression. However, the improvement in intelligence quotient (IQ) was less obvious. These results indicate that UC-MSC transplantation is a promising treatment for cerebral palsy.", "A new aerobic bacterium TN71 was isolated from Tunisian Saharan soil and has been selected for its antimicrobial activity against phytopathogenic bacteria. Based on cellular morphology, physiological characterization and phylogenetic analysis, this isolate has been assigned as Streptomyces sp. TN71 strain. In an attempt to increase its anti-Agrobacterium tumefaciens activity, GYM\u00a0+\u00a0S (glucose, yeast extract, malt extract and starch) medium was selected out of five different production media and the medium composition was optimized. Plackett-Burman design (PBD) was used to select starch, malt extract and glucose as parameters having significant effects on antibacterial activity and a Box-Behnken design was applied for further optimization. The analysis revealed that the optimum concentrations for anti-A. tumefaciens activity of the tested variables were 19.49\u202fg/L for starch, 5.06\u202fg/L for malt extract and 2.07\u202fg/L for glucose. Several Artificial Neural Networks (ANN): the Multilayer perceptron (MLP) and the Radial basis function (RBF) were also constructed to predict anti-A. tumefaciens activity. The comparison between experimental with predicted outputs from ANN and Response Surface Methodology (RSM) were studied. ANN model presents an improvement of 12.36% in terms of determination coefficients of anti A. tumefaciens activity. To our knowledge, this is the first work reporting the statistical versus artificial intelligence based modeling for optimization of bioactive molecules against phytopathogens.", "To make longitudinal comparisons of intelligence quotient (IQ) in children with cochlear implants (CIs) and typical hearing peers from early in development to the school-age period. Children with additional comorbidities and CIs were also evaluated. To estimate the impact of socioeconomic status and oral language on school-age cognitive performance.\nThis longitudinal study evaluated nonverbal IQ in a multicenter, national sample of 147 children with CIs and 75 typically hearing peers. IQ was evaluated at baseline, prior to cochlear implantation, using the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development and the Leiter International Performance Scale. School-age IQ was assessed using the Wechsler Intelligence Scales for Children. For the current study, only the Perceptual Reasoning and Processing Speed indices were administered. Oral language was evaluated using the Comprehensive Assessment of Spoken Language.\nChildren in the CI group scored within the normal range of intelligence at both time points. However, children with additional comorbidities scored significantly worse on the Processing Speed, but not the Perceptual Reasoning Index. Maternal education and language were significantly related to school-age IQ in both groups. Importantly, language was the strongest predictor of intellectual functioning in both children with CIs and normal hearing.\nThese results suggest that children using cochlear implants perform similarly to hearing peers on measures of intelligence, but those with severe comorbidities are at-risk for cognitive deficits. Despite the strong link between socioeconomic status and intelligence, this association was no longer significant once spoken language performance was accounted for. These results reveal the important contributions that early intervention programs, which emphasize language and parent training, contribute to cognitive functioning in school-age children with CIs. For families from economically disadvantaged backgrounds, who are at-risk for suboptimal outcomes, these early intervention programs are critical to improve overall functioning.", "Openness/Intellect (i.e., openness to experience) is the Big Five personality factor most consistently associated with individual differences in creativity. Recent psychometric evidence has demonstrated that this factor consists of two distinct aspects-Intellect and Openness. Whereas Intellect reflects perceived intelligence and intellectual engagement, Openness reflects engagement with fantasy, perception, and aesthetics. We investigated the extent to which Openness and Intellect are associated with variations in brain structure as measured by cortical thickness, area, and volume (N\u2009=\u2009185). Our results demonstrated that Openness was correlated inversely with cortical thickness and volume in left middle frontal gyrus (BA 6), middle temporal gyrus (MTG, BA 21), and superior temporal gyrus (BA 41), and exclusively with cortical thickness in left inferior parietal lobule (BA 40), right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG, BA 45), and MTG (BA 37). When age and sex were statistically controlled for, the inverse correlations between Openness and cortical thickness remained statistically significant for all regions except left MTG, whereas the correlations involving cortical volume remained statistically significant only for left middle frontal gyrus. There was no statistically significant correlation between Openness and cortical area, and no statistically significant correlation between Intellect and cortical thickness, area, or volume. Our results demonstrate that individual differences in Openness are correlated with variation in brain structure-particularly as indexed by cortical thickness. Given the involvement of the above regions in processes related to memory and cognitive control, we discuss the implications of our findings for the possible contribution of personality to creative cognition.", "In both child and adult psychiatry, empirical evidence has now accrued to suggest that a single dimension is able to measure a person's liability to mental disorder, comorbidity among disorders, persistence of disorders over time, and severity of symptoms. This single dimension of general psychopathology has been termed \"p,\" because it conceptually parallels a dimension already familiar to behavioral scientists and clinicians: the \"g\" factor of general intelligence. As the g dimension reflects low to high mental ability, the p dimension represents low to high psychopathology severity, with thought disorder at the extreme. The dimension of p unites all disorders. It influences present/absent status on hundreds of psychiatric symptoms, which modern nosological systems typically aggregate into dozens of distinct diagnoses, which in turn aggregate into three overarching domains, namely, the externalizing, internalizing, and psychotic experience domains, which finally aggregate into one dimension of psychopathology from low to high: p. Studies show that the higher a person scores on p, the worse that person fares on measures of family history of psychiatric illness, brain function, childhood developmental history, and adult life impairment. A dimension of p may help account for ubiquitous nonspecificity in psychiatry: multiple disorders share the same risk factors and biomarkers and often respond to the same therapies. Here, the authors summarize the history of the unidimensional idea, review modern research into p, demystify statistical models, articulate some implications of p for prevention and clinical practice, and outline a transdiagnostic research agenda.

Participants studied Swahili-English word pairs and repeatedly studied half the pairs or attempted retrieval, with feedback, for the remaining half. Word pairs were easy or difficult to learn. Overall, participants showed a benefit of testing over restudy. However, almost 1/3 of the sample had a negative testing effect and benefitted more from restudy than testing, as well as performing better overall. These individuals self-reported less use of shallower encoding strategies than positive testing effect participants but did not differ in other dimensions. For individuals with a positive testing effect, difficulty had differential effects on participants who scored high or low on a measure of gF, with high gF participants showing larger testing effects for difficult over easy items, whereas low gF participants showed the opposite. Working memory performance was not related to the magnitude of the testing effect; however, vocabulary knowledge revealed a similar pattern as gF, with higher vocabulary associated with a testing effect for difficult but not easy items. This suggests that the benefit of retrieval practice varies with item difficulty and participant abilities. Thus, recommendations to engage in retrieval practice should take into consideration the interactive effects of to-be-learned materials and individual differences in the learners. (PsycINFO Database Record", "We investigate the influence of the visual appearance of a negotiator on persuasiveness within the context of negotiations. Psychological experiments were conducted to quantitatively analyze the relationship between visual appearance and the use of language. Male and female participants were shown three female and male photographs, respectively. They were asked to report how they felt about each photograph using a seven-point semantic differential (SD) scale for six affective factors (positive impression, extraversion, intelligence, conscientiousness, emotional stability, and agreeableness). Participants then answered how they felt about each negotiation scenario (they were presented with pictures and a situation combined with negotiation sentences) using a seven-point SD scale for seven affective factors (positive impression, extraversion, intelligence, conscientiousness, emotional stability, agreeableness, and degree of persuasion). Two experiments were conducted using different participant groups depending on the negotiation situations. Photographs with good or bad appearances were found to show high or low degrees of persuasion, respectively. A multiple regression equation was obtained, indicating the importance of the three language factors (euphemistic, honorific, and sympathy expressions) to impressions made during negotiation. The result shows that there are optimal negotiation sentences based on various negotiation factors, such as visual appearance and use of language. For example, persons with good appearance might worsen their impression during negotiations by using certain language, although their initial impression was positive, and persons with bad appearance could effectively improve their impressions in negotiations through their use of language, although the final impressions of their negotiation counterpart might still be more negative than those for persons with good appearance. In contrast, the impressions made by persons of normal appearance were not easily affected by their use of language. The results of the present study have significant implications for future studies of effective negotiation strategies considering visual appearance as well as gender.", "The aim of this study was to investigate long-term cognitive outcome, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and psychiatric symptoms in children and young adults diagnosed with a glioneuronal tumor in childhood.\nTwenty-eight children and adolescents (0-17.99years) with a minimum postoperative follow-up time of five years were eligible for the study; four persons declined participation. A cross-sectional long-term follow-up evaluation was performed using the following study measures: Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC-IV) or Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS-IV), Reys Complex Figure Test (RCFT), Short Form 36 version 2 (SF-36v2), Short Form 10 (SF-10), Quality of Life in Epilepsy 31 (QOLIE-31), Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS) or Beck Youth Inventory Scales (BYI), and Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale. Historical WISC-III and RCFT data were used to compare cognitive longitudinal data.\nMean follow-up time after surgery was 12.1years. Sixty-three percent (15/24) were seizure-free. Despite a successive postoperative gain in cognitive function, a significant reduction relative to norms was seen in the seizure-free group with respect to perceptual reasoning index (PRI), working memory index (WMI), and full-scale intelligence quotient (FSIQ). Seizure freedom resulted in acceptable HRQoL. Thirty-two percent and 16% exceeded the threshold level of possible anxiety and depression, respectively, despite seizure freedom.\nAlthough lower than in corresponding reference groups, cognitive outcome and HRQoL are good provided that seizure freedom or at least a low seizure severity can be achieved. There is a risk of elevated levels of psychiatric symptoms. Long-term clinical follow-up is advisable.", "This study is to analyze the radiation dose of head, body and tail of hippocampus (HC) of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients treated with intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). Evaluate cognitive function of patients with Wechsler adult intelligence scale-Chinese revised (WAIS-CR). HC were segmented into HC head (HH), HC body (HB) and HC tail (HT) and the indexes were then analyzed. WAIS-CR was tested before and 3months after radiotherapy. The mean radiation dose of left and right HC was (1147\u2009\u00b1\u2009976)cGy, (1011\u2009\u00b1\u2009602)cGy respectively. The radiation dose and the volume exposed in different dose of HH, HB and HT decreased in turn. For 5 patients, before and after radiotherapy, the regular-order score was 8.60\u2009\u00b1\u20091.34, 8.0\u2009\u00b1\u20091.00 (P\u2009=\u20090.43), while the reverse-order score was 5.80\u2009\u00b1\u20090.84, 5.20\u2009\u00b1\u20090.84 (P\u2009=\u20090.07). The radiation dose of HH, HB and HT was different, and the radiation dose of HH was the highest, which should be emphasized especially.", "The concept of personality coherence refers to the extent of psychological unity and wholeness embodied within each individual. In the present research, we examined the extent to which the narrative, functional, and organismic conceptualizations of personality coherence interrelate, as well as their associations with psychological abilities and personal adjustment. College students ( N = 391) narrated accounts of three personal memories; listed five personal strivings that they subsequently compared and evaluated; completed performance measures of their intelligence, wisdom, and creativity; and rated their hedonic and eudaimonic well-being. Individuals who coherently organized their autobiographical memories were protected against feeling pressured or compelled in their personal strivings and against being steered toward need-detracting futures. Narrative indicators of coherence were otherwise independent of the functional and organismic indicators, although all indicators of personality coherence correlated with personal adjustment. Wisdom and creativity predicted narrative coherence, which partially mediated the associations they demonstrated with eudaimonic well-being.", "To promote a better understanding of the impact of refugee resettlement work on refugee resettlement workers, this study examined the prevalence rates of deleterious mental health and occupational outcomes, such as secondary traumatic stress and burnout, among a sample of 210 refugee resettlement workers at six refugee resettlement agencies in the United States. The study also explored coping mechanisms used by service providers to manage work-related stress and the influence of such strategies and emotional intelligence on secondary traumatic stress and burnout. Our findings show that certain coping strategies, including self-distraction, humor, venting, substance use, behavioral disengagement, and self-blame, were strongly related to deleterious outcomes, \u03b2s = .18 to .38, ps = .023 to < .001. Emotional intelligence was a negative correlate for all outcomes, \u03b2s = -.25 to -.30, ps < .001, above and beyond the effects of trauma, coping styles, job, and demographic characteristics. These findings have potential implications for clinical training and organizational policy regarding refugee mental health.", "New advances in telemedicine, ubiquitous computing, and artificial intelligence have supported the emergence of more advanced applications and support systems for chronic patients. This trend addresses the important problem of chronic illnesses, highlighted by multiple international organizations as a core issue in future healthcare. Despite the myriad of exciting new developments, each application and system is designed and implemented for specific purposes and lacks the flexibility to support different healthcare concerns. Some of the known problems of such developments are the integration issues between applications and existing healthcare systems, the reusability of technical knowledge in the creation of new and more sophisticated systems and the usage of data gathered from multiple sources in the generation of new knowledge. This paper proposes a framework for the development of chronic disease support systems and applications as an answer to these shortcomings. Through this framework our pursuit is to create a common ground methodology upon which new developments can be created and easily integrated to provide better support to chronic patients, medical staff and other relevant participants. General requirements are inferred for any support system from the primary attention process of chronic patients by the Business Process Management Notation. Numerous technical approaches are proposed to design a general architecture that considers the medical organizational requirements in the treatment of a patient. A framework is presented for any application in support of chronic patients and evaluated by a case study to test the applicability and pertinence of the solution.", "There is a requirement for adequate medical expertise to be available throughout the range of potential future operations involving members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). The aim of this study was to assess the collection and sharing of medical intelligence and medical information (M2I) by NATO Nations, Partner Nations and NATO Command Structure and NATO Force Structure Headquarters (NCS/NFS HQs).\nA transversal survey was conducted between December 2014 and March 2015 using a survey form on M2I sent to NATO Nations and Partnership for Peace (PfP) Nations as well as NCS/NFS HQs.\nCorrectly completed responses were received from 15/40 (37.5%) of the possible NATO and PfP Nations (37.5%) and 7/8 (87.5%) of the NCS/NFS HQs (100.0%). Deficiencies in the collection of M2I data were found due to lack of specific doctrines, networks, tools, structures and organisation.\nThe survey provided an indication even though the participation rate was low for Nations. Part of the problem is thought to be that medical information and medical intelligence often lie in different chains of command. Future directions for this research could include studying the possibilities of a new specific information technology (IT) system to collect and to share M2I. Collection and sharing of M2I within the NATO/PfP community requires facilitation in order to strengthen the basis for decision-making and force health protection. The development of a dedicated NATO IT system may be a precondition for the implementation of an efficient M2I network.", "Little is known about the value of the nutritional risk screening 2002 (NRS2002) scale in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). We conducted a large-scale study to address this issue. We employed a big-data intelligence database platform at our center and identified 3232 eligible patients treated between 2009 and 2013. Of the 3232 (12.9% of 24\u00a0986) eligible patients, 469 (14.5%), 13 (0.4%), 953 (29.5%), 1762 (54.5%) and 35 (1.1%) had NRS2002 scores of 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, respectively. Survival outcomes were comparable between patients with NRS2002 <3 and \u22653 (original scale). However, patients with NRS2002 \u22643 vs >3 (regrouping scale) had significantly different 5-year disease-free survival (DFS; 82.7% vs 75.0%, P\u00a0<\u00a0.001), overall survival (OS; 88.8% vs 84.1%, P\u00a0=\u00a0.001), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS; 90.2% vs 85.9%, P\u00a0=\u00a0.001) and locoregional relapse-free survival (LRRFS; 91.6% vs 87.2%, P\u00a0=\u00a0.001). Therefore, we proposed a revised NRS2002 scale, and found that it provides a better risk stratification than the original or regrouping scales for predicting DFS (area under the curve [AUC]\u00a0=\u00a00.530 vs 0.554 vs 0.577; P\u00a0<\u00a0.05), OS (AUC\u00a0=\u00a00.534 vs 0.563 vs 0.582; P\u00a0<\u00a0.05), DMFS (AUC\u00a0=\u00a00.531 vs 0.567 vs 0.590; P\u00a0<\u00a0.05) and LRRFS (AUC\u00a0=\u00a00.529 vs 0.542 vs 0.564; P\u00a0<\u00a0.05 except scale A vs B). Our proposed NRS2002 scale represents a simple, clinically useful tool for nutritional risk screening in NPC.", "According to the increase of data generated from analytical instruments, application of artificial intelligence(AI)technology in medical field is indispensable. In particular, practical application of AI technology is strongly required in \"genomic medicine\" and \"genomic drug discovery\" that conduct medical practice and novel drug development based on individual genomic information. In our laboratory, we have been developing a database to integrate genome data and clinical information obtained by clinical genome analysis and a computational support system for clinical interpretation of variants using AI. In addition, with the aim of creating new therapeutic targets in genomic drug discovery, we have been also working on the development of a binding affinity prediction system for mutated proteins and drugs by molecular dynamics simulation using supercomputer \"Kei\". We also have tackled for problems in a drug virtual screening. Our developed AI technology has successfully generated virtual compound library, and deep learning method has enabled us to predict interaction between compound and target protein.", "Iodine is essential for normal brain development. Moderate and severe fetal iodine deficiency results in substantial to serious developmental delay in children. Mild iodine deficiency in pregnancy is associated with neurodevelopmental deficits in the offspring, but evidence from randomised trials is lacking. The aim of the Swedish Iodine in Pregnancy and Development in Children study is to determine the effect of daily supplementation with 150\u2009\u00b5g iodine during pregnancy on the offspring's neuropsychological development up to 14 years of age.\nThyroid healthy pregnant women (n=1275: age range 18-40 years) at \u226412 weeks gestation will be randomly assigned to receive multivitamin supplements containing 150\u2009\u00b5g iodine or non-iodine-containing multivitamin daily throughout pregnancy. As a primary outcome, IQ will be measured in the offspring at 7 years (Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-V). As secondary outcomes, IQ will be measured at 3.5 and 14 years, psychomotor development at 18 months and 7 years, and behaviour at 3.5, 7 and 14 years. Iodine status (urinary iodine concentration) will be measured during pregnancy and in the offspring at 3.5, 7 and 14 years. Thyroid function (thyroid hormones, thyroglobulin), and deiodinase type 2 polymorphisms will be measured during pregnancy and in the offspring at 7 and 14 years. Structural MRI or other relevant structural or functional brain imaging procedures will be performed in a subgroup of children at 7 and 14 years. Background and socioeconomic information will be collected at all follow-up times.\nThis study is approved by the Ethics Committee in G\u00f6teborg, Sweden (Diary numbers: 431-12 approved 18 June 2012 (pregnancy part) and 1089-16 approved 8 February 2017 (children follow-up)). According to Swedish regulations, dietary supplements are governed by the National Food Agency and not by the Medical Product Agency. Therefore, there is no requirement for a monitoring committee and the National Food Agency does not perform any audits of trial conduct. The trial will be conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The participating sites will be contacted regarding important protocol changes, both orally and in writing, and the trial registry database will be updated accordingly. Study results will be presented at relevant conferences, and submitted to peer-reviewed journals with open access in the fields of endocrinology, paediatrics and nutrition. After the appropriate embargo period, the results will be communicated to participants, healthcare professionals at the maternal healthcare centres, the public and other relevant groups, such as the national guideline group for thyroid and pregnancy and the National Food Agency.\nNCT02378246; Pre-results.", "There has been sustained clinical and cognitive neuroscience research interest in how network correlates of brain-behavior relationships might be altered in Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) and other neurodevelopmental disorders. As previous work has mostly focused on adults, the nature of whole-brain connectivity networks underlying intelligence in pediatric cohorts with abnormal neurodevelopment requires further investigation. We used network-based statistics (NBS) to examine the association between resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) connectivity and fluid intelligence ability in male children (n = 50) with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD; M = 10.45, SD = 1.58 years and in controls (M\u2009=\u200910.38, SD = 0.96 years) matched on fluid intelligence performance, age and sex. Repeat analyses were performed in independent sites for validation and replication. Despite being equivalent on fluid intelligence ability to strictly matched neurotypical controls, boys with ASD displayed a subnetwork of significantly increased associations between functional connectivity and fluid intelligence. Between-group differences remained significant at higher edge thresholding, and results were validated in independent-site replication analyses in an equivalent age and sex-matched cohort with ASD. Regions consistently implicated in atypical connectivity correlates of fluid intelligence in ASD were the angular gyrus, posterior middle temporal gyrus, occipital and temporo-occipital regions. Development of fluid intelligence neural correlates in young ASD males is aberrant, with an increased strength in intrinsic connectivity association during childhood. Alterations in whole-brain network correlates of fluid intelligence in ASD may be a compensatory mechanism that allows equal task performance to neurotypical peers.", "Geospatial artificial intelligence (geoAI) is an emerging scientific discipline that combines innovations in spatial science, artificial intelligence methods in machine learning (e.g., deep learning), data mining, and high-performance computing to extract knowledge from spatial big data. In environmental epidemiology, exposure modeling is a commonly used approach to conduct exposure assessment to determine the distribution of exposures in study populations. geoAI technologies provide important advantages for exposure modeling in environmental epidemiology, including the ability to incorporate large amounts of big spatial and temporal data in a variety of formats; computational efficiency; flexibility in algorithms and workflows to accommodate relevant characteristics of spatial (environmental) processes including spatial nonstationarity; and scalability to model other environmental exposures across different geographic areas. The objectives of this commentary are to provide an overview of key concepts surrounding the evolving and interdisciplinary field of geoAI including spatial data science, machine learning, deep learning, and data mining; recent geoAI applications in research; and potential future directions for geoAI in environmental epidemiology.", "Psychotic disorders including schizophrenia are commonly accompanied by cognitive deficits. Recent studies have reported negative genetic correlations between schizophrenia and indicators of cognitive ability such as general intelligence and processing speed. Here we compare the effect of polygenetic risk for schizophrenia (PRSSCZ) on measures that differ in their relationships with psychosis onset: a measure of current cognitive abilities (the Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia, BACS) that is greatly reduced in psychotic disorder patients, a measure of premorbid intelligence that is minimally affected by psychosis onset (the Wide-Range Achievement Test, WRAT); and educational attainment (EY), which covaries with both BACS and WRAT. Using genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data from 314 psychotic and 423 healthy research participants in the Bipolar-Schizophrenia Network for Intermediate Phenotypes (B-SNIP) Consortium, we investigated the association of PRSSCZ with BACS, WRAT, and EY. Among apparently healthy individuals, greater genetic risk for schizophrenia (PRSSCZ) was significantly associated with lower BACS scores (r\u2009=\u2009-0.17, p\u2009=\u20096.6\u2009\u00d7\u200910-4 at PT\u2009=\u20091\u2009\u00d7\u200910-4), but not with WRAT or EY. Among individuals with psychosis, PRSSCZ did not associate with variations in any of these three phenotypes. We further investigated the association between PRSSCZ and WRAT in more than 4500 healthy subjects from the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort. The association was again null (p\u2009>\u20090.3, N\u2009=\u20094511), suggesting that different cognitive phenotypes vary in their etiologic relationship with schizophrenia.", "Recent studies reported a negative association between emotional intelligence (EI: defined here as individual predispositions associated with effective identification and regulation of emotions) and emotional eating. Although theory provides some insights into how the concept represents mechanisms that may serve as protective factors, empirical evidence of the mechanism behind the association has yet to be presented. This study tested a proposed model in which anxiety levels mediate the association between emotional intelligence and emotional-eating patterns in a normative sample of women in Israel. A cross-sectional/correlational design was used to gather data from 208 generally healthy female participants who completed measures of trait emotional intelligence, anxiety, and tendency toward emotional eating, as well as demographics. Anxiety levels mediated the negative association between emotional intelligence and emotional eating. Background variables had only marginal involvement in this model. The results shed light on the mechanisms underlying the association between emotional intelligence and emotional eating. Should future studies corroborate the findings, they may serve as a basis for future screening protocols, prevention and interventions with individuals and groups at risk of EE and eating disorders.", "Intellectual disability (ID) is associated with weight gain caused by antiepileptic drugs such as valproic acid. The present study analyzed the relationship between ID and weight loss caused by topiramate (TPM).\nSeventy-eight patients with epilepsy (35 women, aged 18 to 70years) were enrolled in this prospective study. Body weight was measured before and 1, 6, 12, and 18months after initiation of TPM treatment. Both patients and caregivers were provided information about TPM-related weight loss. The patients were divided into the group with no or mild ID (intelligence quotient >50) and the group with moderate to profound ID (intelligence quotient \u226450).\nBody weight of both groups significantly decreased until 6months but stabilized after 12months. Weight loss at 6, 12, and 18months was significantly greater in the group with no or mild ID than in the group with moderate to profound ID. Body weight change at 18months was correlated with intellectual levels (\u03b2=0.274, p=0.011) and baseline body mass index (\u03b2=-0.322, p=0.002) by multiple linear regression analysis.\nThe present study suggests that the pattern of weight loss during TPM administration differs according to intellectual levels. Patients with ID maintained their body weight. Weight loss due to TPM might be weakened by caregiver control of food intake or inactivity.", "Current measures of social cognition have shown inconsistent findings regarding the effects of healthy aging. Moreover, no tests are currently available that allow clinicians and researchers to examine cognitive and affective theory of mind (ToM) and understanding of social norms within the same test. To address these limitations, we present the Edinburgh Social Cognition Test (ESCoT) which assesses cognitive and affective ToM and inter- and intrapersonal understanding of social norms. We examined the effects of age, measures of intelligence and the Broader Autism Phenotype (BAP) on the ESCoT and established tests of social cognition. Additionally, we investigated the convergent validity of the ESCoT based on traditional social cognition measures. The ESCoT was administered alongside Reading the Mind in Films (RMF), Reading the Mind in Eyes (RME), Judgement of Preference and Social Norm Questionnaire to 91 participants (30 aged 18-35 years, 30 aged 45-60 years and 31 aged 65-85 years). Poorer performance on the cognitive and affective ToM ESCoT subtests were predicted by increasing age. The affective ToM ESCoT subtest and RMF were predicted by gender, where being female predicted better performance. Unlike the ESCoT, better performance on the RMF was predicted by higher verbal comprehension and perceptual reasoning abilities, while better performance on the RME was predicted by higher verbal comprehension scores. Lower scores on inter-and intrapersonal understanding of social norms were both predicted by the presence of more autism-like traits while poorer interpersonal understanding of social norms performance was predicted by increasing age. These findings show that the ESCoT is a useful measure of social cognition and, unlike established tests of social cognition, performance is not predicted by measures of verbal comprehension and perceptual reasoning. This is particularly valuable to obtain an accurate assessment of the influence of age on our social cognitive abilities.", "Emotional intelligence as a part of social cognition has, to our knowledge, never been investigated in patients with Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), though the disorder is characterized by aspects of emotional dysfunctioning. PTSD often occurs with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) as a common comorbidity. Studies about social cognition and emotional intelligence in patients with BPD propose aberrant social cognition, but produced inconsistent results regarding emotional intelligence. The present study aims to assess emotional intelligence in patients with PTSD without comorbid BPD, PTSD with comorbid BPD, and BPD patients without comorbid PTSD, as well as in healthy controls. 71 patients with PTSD (41 patients with PTSD without comorbid BPD, 30 patients with PTSD with comorbid BPD), 56 patients with BPD without PTSD, and 63 healthy controls filled in the Test of Emotional Intelligence (TEMINT). Patients with PTSD without comorbid BPD showed impairments in emotional intelligence compared to patients with BPD without PTSD, and compared to healthy controls. These impairments were not restricted to specific emotions. Patients with BPD did not differ significantly from healthy controls. This study provides evidence for an impaired emotional intelligence in PTSD without comorbid BPD compared to BPD and healthy controls, affecting a wide range of emotions.", "In Cord blood transplantation (CBT), the non-inherited maternal antigen (NIMA) virtual six HLA matched CB is found to have similar outcomes to six HLA inherited matched CB. Such virtual HLA matched CB units can be generated by substituting the inherited alleles with one to three NIMAs. In Hong Kong Cord Blood Bank, CB units have no NIMA defined. 100 CB samples were collected with NIMA defined. Retrospective searches of Hong Kong patients (n\u202f=\u202f520) were matched against the inherited and virtual HLA phenotypes of NIMA CB file. One to three NIMA matches was analyzed, virtual six HLA matches were identified for 31.7% patients, 29.4% from CB units with 5/6 HLA match with 1 NIMA match and 1.7% CB units with a 4/6 HLA match and 2 NIMA matches. However, searches in the 167,201 Bone Marrow Donors Worldwide CB units with defined NIMA did not yield similar increases, possibly due to the ethnicity differences between populations. The match performance rises from 26% to 60% after including the NIMA match. Comparing the match performance of 32% in a previous Dutch study, we calculated with 60% matching in this smaller size study. This provides a solid ground to considering NIMA in stem cell donor selection which was adopted in some centers, to be extended to Asian and local CB registries to increase the chance for matches and also to improve patient outcomes, increase the utilization of CB units, enhance clinical flexibility and signify economic intelligence.", "Neoplastic growth and cellular differentiation are critical hallmarks of tumor development. It is well established that cell-to-cell communication between tumor cells and \"normal\" surrounding cells regulates tumor differentiation and proliferation, aggressiveness, and resistance to treatment. Nevertheless, the mechanisms that result in tumor growth and spread as well as the adaptation of healthy surrounding cells to the tumor environment are poorly understood. A major component of these communication systems is composed of connexin (Cx)-containing channels including gap junctions (GJs), tunneling nanotubes (TNTs), and hemichannels (HCs). There are hundreds of reports about the role of Cx-containing channels in the pathogenesis of cancer, and most of them demonstrate a downregulation of these proteins. Nonetheless, new data demonstrate that a localized communication via Cx-containing GJs, HCs, and TNTs plays a key role in tumor growth, differentiation, and resistance to therapies. Moreover, the type and downstream effects of signals communicated between the different populations of tumor cells are still unknown. However, new approaches such as artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) could provide new insights into these signals communicated between connected cells. We propose that the identification and characterization of these new communication systems and their associated signaling could provide new targets to prevent or reduce the devastating consequences of cancer.", "Assessment of performance validity is a necessary component of any neuropsychological evaluation. Prior research has shown that cutoff scores of \u22646 or \u22647 on Reliable Digit Span (RDS) can detect suboptimal effort across numerous adult clinical populations; however, these scores have not been validated for that purpose in an adult epilepsy population. This investigation aims to determine whether these previously established RDS cutoff scores could detect suboptimal effort in adults with epilepsy.\nSixty-three clinically referred adults with a diagnosis of epilepsy or suspected seizures were administered the Digit Span subtest of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS-III or WAIS-IV). Most participants (98%) passed Trial 2 of the Test of Memory Malingering (TOMM), achieving a score of \u226545.\nPreviously established cutoff scores of \u22646 and \u22647 on RDS yielded a specificity rate of 85% and 77% respectively. Findings also revealed that RDS scores were positively related to attention and intellectual functioning. Given the less than ideal specificity rate associated with each of these cutoff scores, together with their strong association to cognitive factors, secondary analyses were conducted to identify more optimal cutoff scores. Preliminary results suggest that an RDS cutoff score of \u22644 may be more appropriate in a clinically referred adult epilepsy population with a low average IQ or lower.\nPreliminary findings indicate that cutoff scores of \u22646 and \u22647 on RDS are not appropriate in adults with epilepsy, especially in individuals with low average IQ or below.", "Efficacious operation for dam and reservoir system could guarantee not only a defenselessness policy against natural hazard but also identify rule to meet the water demand. Successful operation of dam and reservoir systems to ensure optimal use of water resources could be unattainable without accurate and reliable simulation models. According to the highly stochastic nature of hydrologic parameters, developing accurate predictive model that efficiently mimic such a complex pattern is an increasing domain of research. During the last two decades, artificial intelligence (AI) techniques have been significantly utilized for attaining a robust modeling to handle different stochastic hydrological parameters. AI techniques have also shown considerable progress in finding optimal rules for reservoir operation. This review research explores the history of developing AI in reservoir inflow forecasting and prediction of evaporation from a reservoir as the major components of the reservoir simulation. In addition, critical assessment of the advantages and disadvantages of integrated AI simulation methods with optimization methods has been reported. Future research on the potential of utilizing new innovative methods based AI techniques for reservoir simulation and optimization models have also been discussed. Finally, proposal for the new mathematical procedure to accomplish the realistic evaluation of the whole optimization model performance (reliability, resilience, and vulnerability indices) has been recommended.", "We present evidence for the strengths of the intellectual virtues that philosophers and behavioral scientists characterize as key cognitive elements of wisdom. Wisdom has been of centuries-long interest for philosophical scholarship, but relative to intelligence largely neglected in public discourse on educational science, public policy, and societal well-being. Wise reasoning characteristics include intellectual humility, recognition of uncertainty, consideration of diverse viewpoints, and an attempt to integrate these viewpoints. Emerging scholarship on these features of wisdom suggest that they uniquely contribute to societal well-being, improve leadership, shed light on societal inequality, promote cooperation in Public Goods Games and reduce political polarization and intergroup-hostility. We review empirical evidence about macro-cultural, ecological, situational, and person-level processes facilitating and inhibiting wisdom in daily life. Based on this evidence, we speculate about ways to foster wisdom in education, organizations, and institutions.", "This work presents a systematic review concerning recent studies and technologies of machine learning for Barrett's esophagus (BE) diagnosis and treatment. The use of artificial intelligence is a brand new and promising way to evaluate such disease. We compile some works published at some well-established databases, such as Science Direct, IEEEXplore, PubMed, Plos One, Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI), Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), Springer, and Hindawi Publishing Corporation. Each selected work has been analyzed to present its objective, methodology, and results. The BE progression to dysplasia or adenocarcinoma shows a complex pattern to be detected during endoscopic surveillance. Therefore, it is valuable to assist its diagnosis and automatic identification using computer analysis. The evaluation of the BE dysplasia can be performed through manual or automated segmentation through machine learning techniques. Finally, in this survey, we reviewed recent studies focused on the automatic detection of the neoplastic region for classification purposes using machine learning methods.", "Specific learning disabilities are disorders that affect the instrumental skills of academic learning, leaving intact the general intellectual functioning. It is possible to distinguish: dyslexia, dysorthography, dysgraphia, and dyscalculia. The diagnosis is made according to DSMV. The aim of this study is to evaluate the implementation of Law N\u00b0 170 following a diagnosis of specific learning disabilities in children and their evolution over time.\nThe sample under examination consists of 75 children, 56 males and 18 females aged 7,8 to 16 years, with a diagnosis of specific learning disabilities; a revaluation was carried outthrough the use of standardized instruments according to age and school attended. A twopart questionnaire was proposed: the first part turned to the parents/carers of the child and the second part turned to the boy himself. The improvement parameter has been linked, through a statistical analysis of univarianza with intelligence quotient, age, application of the law 10 October 2010 n 170, rehabilitative paths and attending afterschool program.\nMost of the guys are followed at school by the application of the law 170 and, outside school, by attending speech and neuropsychological therapy and after school. Going to investigate the actual use of the measures put in place by the school, it is evident a partial and incomplete application of Law 170.\nThe most suitable measures for these children are pedagogical measures in order to make them integrate with the group class and strengthen their capacities through specific measures provided by a specific legislative decree.", "Mechanocomputational techniques in conjunction with artificial intelligence (AI) are revolutionizing the interpretations of the crucial information from the medical data and converting it into optimized and organized information for diagnostics. It is possible due to valuable perfection in artificial intelligence, computer aided diagnostics, virtual assistant, robotic surgery, augmented reality and genome editing (based on AI) technologies. Such techniques are serving as the products for diagnosing emerging microbial or non microbial diseases. This article represents a combinatory approach of using such approaches and providing therapeutic solutions towards utilizing these techniques in disease diagnostics.", "Short form of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale is often needed to quickly estimate intelligence for time-saving or screening in clinical practice. The present study aims to examine the psychometric properties of Chinese version of the four-subtest index-based short form (SF4) of WAIS-IV (FS) and to confirm its clinical application. 1,757 adults from the WAIS-IV Chinese version standardization sample and 239 mixed clinical samples including patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder (SCH), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and mild or moderate intellectual disability (ID) were used. Demographic data were collected and intelligence was assessed with WAIS-IV. The SF4 split-half reliability, test-retest stability coefficients and corrected SF4-FS correlations were good to excellent. The result of the Bland-Altman plot showed that the difference fell within 2SD was 95% and indicated a random error. The sensitivity, specificity positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of the stepwise screening were good. There was an interaction (p < .001) between the IQ level (\u2265111) and gender on the accuracy of SF4, SF4 might get underestimated on females with the IQ level (\u2265111) than on males. In conclusion, SF4 is a valid and reliable instrument for use in the clinic, and its clinical application, stepwise screening and influencing factors in clinical use are discussed herein.", "It is debated whether cognitive training of specific executive functions leads to far transfer effects, such as improvements in fluid intelligence (Gf). Within this context, transcranial direct current stimulation and recently also novel protocols such as transcranial random noise and alternating current stimulation are being investigated with regards to their ability to enhance cognitive training outcomes. We compared the effects of four different transcranial electrical brain stimulation protocols in combination with nine daily computerized training sessions on Gf. 82 participants were randomly assigned to receive transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), random noise stimulation (tRNS), multifocal alternating current stimulation at 40\u202fHz (mftACS), or multifocal tDCS (mftDCS) in combination with an adaptive and synergistic executive function (EF) training, or to a no-contact control group. EF training consisted of gamified tasks drawing on isolated as well as integrated executive functions (working memory, inhibition, cognitive flexibility). Transfer was assessed with a combined measure of Gf including three established tests (Bochumer Matrizentest - BOMAT, Raven's Advanced Progressive Matrices - RAPM, and Sandia Matrices). We found significant improvements in Gf for the tDCS, mftDCS, and tRNS groups when compared with the no-contact group. In contrast, the mftACS group did not improve significantly and showed a similar pattern as the no-contact group. Mediation analyses indicated that the improvement in Gf was mediated through game progression in the mftDCS and tRNS group. Electrical brain stimulation in combination with sustained EF training can lead to transfer effects in Gf, which are mediated by training progression.", "Performance on the Embedded Figures Test (EFT) has been interpreted as a reflection of local/global perceptual style, weak central coherence and/or field independence, as well as a measure of intelligence and executive function. The variable ways in which EFT findings have been interpreted demonstrate that the construct validity of this measure is unclear. In order to address this lack of clarity, we investigated to what extent performance on a new Embedded Figures Test (L-EFT) correlated with measures of intelligence, executive functions and estimates of local/global perceptual styles. In addition, we compared L-EFT performance to the original group EFT to directly contrast both tasks. Taken together, our results indicate that performance on the L-EFT does not correlate strongly with estimates of local/global perceptual style, intelligence or executive functions. Additionally, the results show that performance on the L-EFT is similarly associated with memory span and fluid intelligence as the group EFT. These results suggest that the L-EFT does not reflect a general perceptual or cognitive style/ability. These results further emphasize that empirical data on the construct validity of a task do not always align with the face validity of a task.", "Background Due to their presence in clinical educational settings when dealing with patients, medical science students are more affected by mental disorders than other students. Some experts believe that spiritual intelligence enhances people adaptability and compatibility and creates calm in humans, especially in stressful situations. Objective The objective of this study was to investigate the relationship between spiritual intelligence and aggression among students of medical sciences in the southeast of Iran. Methods This analytical-descriptive study was conducted among bachelor students of Medical Sciences in the Southeast of Iran and examples of the research were selected from the Schools of Nursing and Midwifery, Public Health, Paramedical and Management by a stratified random sampling method. To examine samples questionnaires were used which examined students' demographic information, and included King's 24-item Questionnaire of Spiritual Intelligence and the Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire (AQ). After completing the questionnaires, data were analyzed using statistical analysis software (SPSS version18) with a significance level (p < 0.05). Results The results showed that there is a significant negative correlation between spiritual intelligence and aggression of students (r = -0/19, p = 0/001). Results also showed that Students of Medical Sciences in the Southeast of Iran with a spiritual intelligence average score of 52.28 have an average spiritual intelligence and those with an aggression average score of 78.57 have higher aggression than average. Conclusion The results showed that with increasing spiritual intelligence, aggression decreases. The results can be used by policymakers and managers to take steps to reduce aggressive behaviors and mental disorders and for the promotion of spiritual intelligence of students of medical sciences.", "The human genome is now investigated through high-throughput functional assays, and through the generation of population genomic data. These advances support the identification of functional genetic variants and the prediction of traits (e.g. deleterious variants and disease). This review summarizes lessons learned from the large-scale analyses of genome and exome data sets, modeling of population data and machine-learning strategies to solve complex genomic sequence regions. The review also portrays the rapid adoption of artificial intelligence/deep neural networks in genomics; in particular, deep learning approaches are well suited to model the complex dependencies in the regulatory landscape of the genome, and to provide predictors for genetic variant calling and interpretation.", "Children born preterm are prone to motor problems. Research on their motor performance has, however, rarely been integrated with sensory processing.\nTo examine sensory-motor performance in children born extremely preterm (EPT).\nIn a longitudinal prospective cohort study, 49 EPT (born <28 gestational weeks; 32 boys and 17 girls) and 33 term-born (16 boys and 17 girls) children were assessed with six individual subtests from the Sensory Integration and Praxis Tests at the age of 7.0 to 7.3\u202fyears.\nThe rate of test z-scores indicating dysfunction [from -2 standard deviations (SD) to <\u202f-1 SD for mild and\u202f<\u202f-2 SD for moderate-to-severe] was significantly higher in EPT children than in term-born children in all the subtests. When comparing mean performance adjusted for gender and mother's education, EPT children performed worse than term-born children in Design Copying (z-score difference\u202f-\u202f0.83; 95% confidence interval -1.32 to -0.34), Motor Accuracy (-0.82; -1.26 to -0.38), Postural Praxis (-0.95; -1.45 to -0.45), Manual Form Perception (-0.59; -1.12 to -0.06), and Finger Identification (-0.88; -1.45 to -0.31). Additional adjustment for Full-Scale Intelligence Quotient rendered difference in Manual Form Perception non-significant.\nSeven-year-old EPT children perform worse than their term-born peers in tests for visual-motor, somatosensory, and motor planning performance.", "During the fourth quarter of 2017, Cortellis Competitive Intelligence registered 1,107 new deals (excluding mergers & acquisitions) as part of its ongoing coverage of licensing activity in the life sciences sector compared to 1,043 in the third quarter and 1,035 in the fourth quarter of 2016.", "Research in animals suggests that decisions about physical versus cognitive effort have distinct neural bases, but exploration of this question in humans is hampered by lack of parallel measures of physical and cognitive effort for rewards. We developed a novel measure of willingness to exert cognitive effort for rewards, the C-EEfRT, paralleling the validated physical effort expenditure for rewards task (EEfRT). To validate the C-EEfRT we: (a) tested whether EEfRT and C-EEfRT tasks were equivalently difficult; (b) tested whether decisions on the EEfRT and C-EEfRT were equivalently responsive to changes in reward; (c) examined relationships between the C-EEfRT and anhedonia, intelligence, and working memory. Last, we tested the relationship between willingness to exert physical and cognitive effort for rewards in humans. Sixty healthy adults completed the EEfRT, the C-EEfRT, an anhedonia self-report, an intelligence test, and a working memory task. Overall willingness to exert effort was higher on the C-EEfRT than the EEfRT, particularly when reward probability and amount were low. This was despite participants perceiving the cognitive task as more difficult, and having greater difficulty completing it. Differential effects of physical fatigue may have contributed. Anhedonia was not related to effort on either measure. Working memory, but not intelligence, was associated with cognitive effort. There was a moderate relationship between cognitive and physical effort. These findings suggest the importance of measuring cognitive effort as distinct from physical effort in humans. Future studies should consider calibrating task difficulty for each individual, and exploring cognitive effort in clinical populations. (PsycINFO Database Record", "Cyberbullying has been linked to social, physical and psychological problems for adolescent victims but there has been no analysis of the specific role of emotional intelligence in protecting against the negative symptoms associated with cyberbullying victimization. This study examined the interaction between cyberbullying victimization and emotional intelligence (EI) as predictors of psychological maladjustment (operationalized as high suicidal ideation and low self-esteem) in 1,660 Spanish adolescents. We also investigated whether levels of EI moderated the relationship between cyberbullying victimization and mental health problems. The cyberbullying victimization x EI interaction contributed to variance in suicidal ideation and self-esteem in our sample of adolescent victims. Adolescent victims of cyberbullying with high EI scores reported lower suicidal ideation and higher self-esteem than their less emotionally intelligent counterparts. Thus, our data provide empirical support for theoretical and conceptual work connecting victimization, EI abilities and mental health associated with cyberbullying. This suggests that alone, but also in combination, EI may be particularly relevant in leading to increased levels of mental health issues in cyberbullying victims. Finally, the theoretical implications of our findings on the relationship between these variables and the mental health issues of adolescent victims of cyberbullying are discussed.", "Little is known about the relationship between prosodic abilities and executive function skills. As deficits in executive functions (EFs) and prosodic impairments are characteristics of autism, we examined how EFs are related to prosodic performance in children with high-functioning autism (HFA). Fifteen children with HFA (M = 7.4 years; SD = 1.12), matched to 15 typically developing peers on age, gender, and non-verbal intelligence participated in the study. The Profiling Elements of Prosody in Speech-Communication (PEPS-C) was used to assess prosodic performance. The Children's Color Trails Test (CCTT-1, CCTT-2, and CCTT Interference Index) was used as an indicator of executive control abilities. Our findings suggest no relation between prosodic abilities and visual search and processing speed (assessed by CCTT-1), but a significant link between prosodic skills and divided attention, working memory/sequencing, set-switching, and inhibition (assessed by CCTT-2 and CCTT Interference Index). These findings may be of clinical relevance since difficulties in EFs and prosodic deficits are characteristic of many neurodevelopmental disorders. Future studies are needed to further investigate the nature of the relationship between impaired prosody and executive (dys)function.", "Butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), an ester hydrolase produced mainly by the liver, hydrolyzes certain short-acting neuromuscular blocking agents, like succinylcholine and mivacurium that are widely used during anesthesia. Patients with BChE deficiency are possibly in danger of postanesthetic apnea. Hereditary BChE deficiency results from the mutations of BCHE gene located on chromosome 3, 3q26.1-q26.2, between nucleotides 165,490,692-165,555,260.\nThis study describes a novel mutation in a child with BChE deficiency. In general, this child appeared healthy and well-developed with a normal appearance. However, the results of Wechsler Intelligence Scale showed that the full-scale intelligence quotient (FIQ) was 53, classified into the group with the minor defect. The BChE activity was 32.0\u00a0U/L, considerably lower than the normal lower limit (reference range: 5000-12,000\u00a0U/L). Sanger sequencing showed that there were 2 mutations in the exon 2 of BCHE gene of this child. One is a heterozygous mutation rs764588882 (NM_000055.3: c.401_402insA, p.Asn134Lysfs*23). The other one is a heterozygous mutation (NM_000055.3: c.73A\u2009>\u2009T, p.Lys25Ter) that has never been reported before. The two mutations lead to a premature stop of transcription.\nDouble heterozygous recessive mutations are the cause of BChE deficiency of this boy in this study, including a novel mutation c.73A\u2009>\u2009T. Intellectual disability is a new phenotype that is probably associated with this mutation.", "Mobile devices have become an essential part of our daily lives. By virtue of both their increasing computing power and the recent progress made in AI, mobile devices evolved to act as intelligent assistants in many tasks rather than a mere way of making phone calls. However, popular and commonly used tools and frameworks for machine intelligence are still lacking the ability to make proper use of the available heterogeneous computing resources on mobile devices. In this paper, we study the benefits of utilizing the heterogeneous (CPU and GPU) computing resources available on commodity android devices while running deep learning models. We leveraged the heterogeneous computing framework RenderScript to accelerate the execution of deep learning models on commodity Android devices. Our system is implemented as an extension to the popular open-source framework TensorFlow. By integrating our acceleration framework tightly into TensorFlow, machine learning engineers can now easily make benefit of the heterogeneous computing resources on mobile devices without the need of any extra tools. We evaluate our system on different android phones models to study the trade-offs of running different neural network operations on the GPU. We also compare the performance of running different models architectures such as convolutional and recurrent neural networks on CPU only vs using heterogeneous computing resources. Our result shows that although GPUs on the phones are capable of offering substantial performance gain in matrix multiplication on mobile devices. Therefore, models that involve multiplication of large matrices can run much faster (approx. 3 times faster in our experiments) due to GPU support.", "Using bibliometrics, we analyzed the research status of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB, a popular tumor immunotherapy method represented by antibodies targeted CTLA-4 and PD-1/PD-L1) in tumor immunotherapy in China during the past 2 decades.\nArticles in Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED), patents in Thomson Innovation, and drugs in Cortellis Competitive Intelligence in the field of ICB for tumor immunotherapy from 1996 to 2015 were the subjects of bibliometric analysis. Using database-attached software and Excel, quantitative analyses were performed including examination of the number of documents, citation frequency, h-index, key projects, quantity of publications, public patents, and status of new drug research.\nThe number of publications from 1996 to 2015 in the field of ICB for tumor immunotherapy that came out of China was 380, which was 14.3% of the total publications worldwide and was second only to that of the USA. In the past decade, China has rapidly increased the number of publications and patents in this field. However, indicators of publication influence, such as citation frequency and h-index, were far behind other advanced countries. In addition, the total number of patents in China was much lower than that of the USA. China has introduced 5 drugs for ICB that are being developed for the healthcare market.\nTumor immunotherapy research such as ICB in China has developed rapidly with increasing influence in the last 2 decades. However, there is still a relatively large gap compared with the USA. It is expected that China will have greater influence on tumor immunotherapy research in the near future.", "Lightweight, compressible and highly sensitive pressure/strain sensing materials are highly desirable for the development of health monitoring, wearable devices and artificial intelligence. Herein, a very simple, low-cost and solution-based approach is presented to fabricate versatile piezoresistive sensors based on conductive polyurethane (PU) sponges coated with synergistic multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and graphene. These sensor materials are fabricated by convenient dip-coating layer-by-layer (LBL) electrostatic assembly followed by in situ reduction without using any complicated microfabrication processes. The resultant conductive MWCNT/RGO@PU sponges exhibit very low densities (0.027-0.064 g cm-3), outstanding compressibility (up to 75%) and high electrical conductivity benefiting from the porous PU sponges and synergistic conductive MWCNT/RGO structures. In addition, the MWCNT/RGO@PU sponges present larger relative resistance changes and superior sensing performances under external applied pressures (0-5.6 kPa) and a wide range of strains (0-75%) compared with the RGO@PU and MWCNT@PU sponges, due to the synergistic effect of multiple mechanisms: \"disconnect-connect\" transition of nanogaps, microcracks and fractured skeletons at low compression strain and compressive contact of the conductive skeletons at high compression strain. The electrical and piezoresistive properties of MWCNT/RGO@PU sponges are strongly associated with the dip-coating cycle, suspension concentration, and the applied pressure and strain. Fully functional applications of MWCNT/RGO@PU sponge-based piezoresistive sensors in lighting LED lamps and detecting human body movements are demonstrated, indicating their excellent potential for emerging applications such as health monitoring, wearable devices and artificial intelligence.", "Privacy is commonly regarded as a regulatory requirement achieved via technical and organizational management practices. Those working in the field of informatics often play a role in privacy preservation as a result of their expertise in information technology, workflow analysis, implementation science, or related skills. Viewing privacy from the perspective of patients whose protected health information is at risk broadens the considerations to include the perceived duality of privacy; the existence of privacy within a context unique to each patient; the competing needs inherent within privacy management; the need for particular consideration when data are shared; and the need for patients to control health information in a global setting. With precision medicine, artificial intelligence, and other treatment innovations on the horizon, health care professionals need to think more broadly about how to preserve privacy in a health care environment driven by data sharing. Patient-reported privacy preferences, privacy portability, and greater transparency around privacy-preserving functionalities are potential strategies for ensuring that privacy regulations are met and privacy is preserved.", "Neuropsychological deficits are present across various cognitive domains in major depressive disorder (MDD). However, a consistent and specific profile of neuropsychological abnormalities has not yet been established.\nWe assessed cognition in 170 patients with non-psychotic MDD using the Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia and the scores were compared with those of 42 patients with schizophrenia as a reference for severity of cognitive impairment. Hierarchical cluster analysis was conducted to determine whether there are discrete neurocognitive subgroups in MDD. We then compared the subgroups in terms of several clinical factors and social functioning.\nThree distinct neurocognitive subgroups were found: (1) a mild impairment subgroup with near-normative performance and mild dysfunction in motor speed; (2) a selective impairment subgroup, which exhibited preserved working memory and executive function, but moderate to severe deficits in verbal memory, motor speed, verbal fluency, and attention/information processing speed; and (3) a global impairment subgroup with moderate to severe deficits across all neurocognitive domains, comparable with deficits in schizophrenia. The global impairment subgroup was characterized by lower pre-morbid intelligence quotient (IQ). Moreover, a significant difference between groups was observed in premorbid IQ (p = 0.003), antidepressant dose (p = 0.043), antipsychotic dose (p = 0.013), or anxiolytic dose (p < 0.001).\nThese results suggest the presence of multiple neurocognitive subgroups in non-psychotic MDD with unique profiles, one of which exhibits deficits comparable to those of schizophrenia. The results of the present study may help guide future efforts to target these disabling symptoms using different treatments.", "To identify digital biomarkers associated with cognitive function, we analyzed human-computer interaction from 7 days of smartphone use in 27 subjects (ages 18-34) who received a gold standard neuropsychological assessment. For several neuropsychological constructs (working memory, memory, executive function, language, and intelligence), we found a family of digital biomarkers that predicted test scores with high correlations (p\u2009<\u200910-4). These preliminary results suggest that passive measures from smartphone use could be a continuous ecological surrogate for laboratory-based neuropsychological assessment.", "Flexible pressure sensors are of great importance to be applied in artificial intelligence and wearable electronics. However, assembling a simple structure, high-performance capacitive pressure sensor, especially for monitoring the flow of liquids, is still a big challenge. Here, on the basis of a sandwich-like structure, we propose a facile capacitive pressure sensor optimized by a flexible, low-cost nylon netting, showing many merits including a high response sensitivity (0.33 kPa-1) in a low-pressure regime (<1 kPa), an ultralow detection limit as 3.3 Pa, excellent working stability after more than 1000 cycles, and synchronous monitoring for human pulses and clicks. More important, this sensor exhibits an ultrafast response speed (<20 ms), which enables its detection for the fast variations of a small applied pressure from the morphological changing processes of a droplet falling onto the sensor. Furthermore, a capacitive pressure sensor array is fabricated for demonstrating the ability to spatial pressure distribution. Our developed pressure sensors show great prospects in practical applications such as health monitoring, flexible tactile devices, and motion detection.", "To test the immediate and long-term effectiveness of Cogmed Working Memory Training following extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and/or congenital diaphragmatic hernia.\nA nationwide randomized controlled trial assessing neuropsychologic outcome immediately and 1 year post Cogmed Working Memory Training, conducted between October 2014 and June 2017. Researchers involved in the follow-up assessments were blinded to group allocation.\nErasmus MC-Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, and Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen, the Netherlands.\nEligible participants were neonatal extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and/or congenital diaphragmatic hernia survivors (8-12 yr) with an intelligence quotient greater than or equal to 80 and a z score less than or equal to -1.5 on at least one (working) memory test at first assessment.\nCogmed Working Memory Training, comprising 25 45-minute training sessions for 5 consecutive weeks at home.\nParticipants were randomized to Cogmed Working Memory Training (n = 19) or no intervention (n = 24) (two dropped out after T0). Verbal working memory (estimated coefficient = 0.87; p = 0.002) and visuospatial working memory (estimated coefficient=0.96, p = 0.003) significantly improved at T1 post Cogmed Working Memory Training but was similar between groups at T2 (verbal, p = 0.902; visuospatial, p = 0.416). Improvements were found at T2 on long-term visuospatial memory following Cogmed Working Memory Training (estimated coefficient = 0.95; p = 0.003). Greater improvements in this domain at T2 following Cogmed Working Memory Training were associated with better self-rated school functioning (r = 0.541; p = 0.031) and parent-rated attention (r = 0.672; p = 0.006).\nWorking memory improvements after Cogmed Working Memory Training disappeared 1 year post training in neonatal extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and/or congenital diaphragmatic hernia survivors. Gains in visuospatial memory persisted 1 year post intervention. Cogmed Working Memory Training may be beneficial for survivors with visuospatial memory deficits.", "Internet gaming disorder (IGD) was included in the Addendum to DSM-5 as a condition for further study. Studies of community samples using a diagnostic interview are lacking, and evaluations of the proposed symptoms, comorbidities, and predictors of IGD are scarce. To provide such information participants in a Norwegian prospective community study were assessed with a clinical interview at age 10\u00a0years. Symptoms of other psychiatric disorders were measured with the Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Assessment at ages 8 and 10 (n\u2009=\u2009740). Children, parents, and teachers provided information on demographics, temperament, intelligence, executive functions, self-concept, social skills, victimization, emotion regulation, family climate, and parenting. Results indicated that IGD was present in 1.7% (95% confidence interval, 0.7-2.7) of the participants (3.0% boys and 0.5% girls). Factor analysis revealed two factors: heavy involvement and negative consequences. The positive predictive value of withdrawal, tolerance, and unsuccessful attempts to control gaming symptoms to the disorder was low. Symptoms of other common disorders correlated weakly with IGD-symptoms (i.e., from r\u2009=\u20090.07 to r\u2009=\u20090.15). Upon adjusting for gender and gaming at age 8, only limited social and emotion regulation skills at age 8 predicted more age-10 IGD symptoms. In conclusion, IGD is already present in a small percentage of Norwegian 10-year olds. At least three of the proposed symptoms -- withdrawal, tolerance and unsuccessful attempts to control gaming -- merit further study given their weak associations with the disorder. Symptoms of IGD are only marginally associated with symptoms of other psychiatric disorders and only predicted by social skills and emotion regulation deficits.", "Rooted deeply in medical multiple criteria decision-making (MCDM), risk assessment is very important especially when applied to the risk of being affected by deadly diseases such as coronary heart disease (CHD). CHD risk assessment is a stochastic, uncertain, and highly dynamic process influenced by various known and unknown variables. In recent years, there has been a great interest in fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP), a popular methodology for dealing with uncertainty in MCDM. This paper proposes a new FAHP, bimodal fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (BFAHP) that augments two aspects of knowledge, probability and validity, to fuzzy numbers to better deal with uncertainty. In BFAHP, fuzzy validity is computed by aggregating the validities of relevant risk factors based on expert knowledge and collective intelligence. By considering both soft and statistical data, we compute the fuzzy probability of risk factors using the Bayesian formulation. In BFAHP approach, these fuzzy validities and fuzzy probabilities are used to construct a reciprocal comparison matrix. We then aggregate fuzzy probabilities and fuzzy validities in a pairwise manner for each risk factor and each alternative. BFAHP decides about being affected and not being affected by ranking of high and low risks. For evaluation, the proposed approach is applied to the risk of being affected by CHD using a real dataset of 152 patients of Iranian hospitals. Simulation results confirm that adding validity in a fuzzy manner can accrue more confidence of results and clinically useful especially in the face of incomplete information when compared with actual results. Applying the proposed BFAHP on CHD risk assessment of the dataset, it yields high accuracy rate above 85% for correct prediction. In addition, this paper recognizes that the risk factors of diastolic blood pressure in men and high-density lipoprotein in women are more important in CHD than other risk factors.", "Knowledge around emotional intelligence originated in the 1990s from research regarding thoughts, emotions and abilities. The concept of emotional intelligence has evolved over the last 25 years; however, the understanding and use is still unclear. Despite this, emotional intelligence has been a widely-considered concept within professions such as business, management, education, and within the last 10 years has gained traction within nursing practice.\nThe aim of this concept review is to clarify the understanding of the concept emotional intelligence, what attributes signify emotional intelligence, what are its antecedents, consequences, related terms and implications to advance nursing practice.\nA computerized search was guided by Rodger's evolutional concept analysis. Data courses included: CINAHL, PyschINFO, Scopus, EMBASE and ProQuest, focusing on articles published in Canada and the United Stated during 1990-2017.\nA total of 23 articles from various bodies of disciplines were included in this integrative concept review. The analysis reveals that there are many inconsistencies regarding the description of emotional intelligence, however, four common attributes were discovered: self-awareness, self-management, social awareness and social/relationship management. These attributes facilitate the emotional well-being among advance practice nurses and enhances the ability to practice in a way that will benefit patients, families, colleagues and advance practice nurses as working professionals and as individuals.\nThe integration of emotional intelligence is supported within several disciplines as there is consensus on the impact that emotional intelligence has on job satisfaction, stress level, burnout and helps to facilitate a positive environment. Explicit to advance practice nursing, emotional intelligence is a concept that may be central to nursing practice as it has the potential to impact the quality of patient care and outcomes, decision-making, critical thinking and overall the well-being of practicing nurses.", "Prenatal exposure to substances may influence a child's neurodevelopment and impact on subsequent mental health. In a hospital-based population of school-aged children prenatally exposed to opiates and a number of illicit substances (n = 57), we evaluated mental health symptoms associated with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorders (ASD) using the Swanson, Nolan, and Pelham Questionnaire, revision IV (SNAP-IV) and the Autism Spectrum Screening Questionnaire (ASSQ) and compared the scores to a reference group which comprised children from the population-based Bergen Child Study (n = 171). Prenatally exposed children had significantly higher SNAP-IV scores associated with ADHD symptoms in both areas of inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity and also reported a higher ASSQ score related to an increased number of symptoms associated with ASD, compared with the reference group. Of tested predictors of mental health outcomes in the exposed group, the intelligence quotient was a strong predictor of most mental health outcomes, and neonatal abstinence syndrome was a predictor of inattention. In conclusion, prenatally exposed children had more mental health symptoms associated with ADHD and ASD, compared with the reference group.", "Mental health is an indicator of emotional, psychological and social well-being of an individual. It determines how an individual thinks, feels and handle situations. Positive mental health helps one to work productively and realize their full potential. Mental health is important at every stage of life, from childhood and adolescence through adulthood. Many factors contribute to mental health problems which lead to mental illness like stress, social anxiety, depression, obsessive compulsive disorder, drug addiction, and personality disorders. It is becoming increasingly important to determine the onset of the mental illness to maintain proper life balance. The nature of machine learning algorithms and Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be fully harnessed for predicting the onset of mental illness. Such applications when implemented in real time will benefit the society by serving as a monitoring tool for individuals with deviant behavior. This research work proposes to apply various machine learning algorithms such as support vector machines, decision trees, na\u00efve bayes classifier, K-nearest neighbor classifier and logistic regression to identify state of mental health in a target group. The responses obtained from the target group for the designed questionnaire were first subject to unsupervised learning techniques. The labels obtained as a result of clustering were validated by computing the Mean Opinion Score. These cluster labels were then used to build classifiers to predict the mental health of an individual. Population from various groups like high school students, college students and working professionals were considered as target groups. The research presents an analysis of applying the aforementioned machine learning algorithms on the target groups and also suggests directions for future work.", "Physical models typically assume time-independent interactions, whereas neural networks and machine learning incorporate interactions that function as adjustable parameters. Here we demonstrate a new type of abundant cooperative nonlinear dynamics where learning is attributed solely to the nodes, instead of the network links which their number is significantly larger. The nodal, neuronal, fast adaptation follows its relative anisotropic (dendritic) input timings, as indicated experimentally, similarly to the slow learning mechanism currently attributed to the links, synapses. It represents a non-local learning rule, where effectively many incoming links to a node concurrently undergo the same adaptation. The network dynamics is now counterintuitively governed by the weak links, which previously were assumed to be insignificant. This cooperative nonlinear dynamic adaptation presents a self-controlled mechanism to prevent divergence or vanishing of the learning parameters, as opposed to learning by links, and also supports self-oscillations of the effective learning parameters. It hints on a hierarchical computational complexity of nodes, following their number of anisotropic inputs and opens new horizons for advanced deep learning algorithms and artificial intelligence based applications, as well as a new mechanism for enhanced and fast learning by neural networks.", "Life-threatening cardiomyopathy is a severe, but common, complication associated with severe trauma or sepsis. Several signaling pathways involved in apoptosis and necroptosis are linked to trauma- or sepsis-associated cardiomyopathy. However, the underling causative factors are still debatable. Heparan sulfate (HS) fragments belong to the class of danger/damage-associated molecular patterns liberated from endothelial-bound proteoglycans by heparanase during tissue injury associated with trauma or sepsis. We hypothesized that HS induces apoptosis or necroptosis in murine cardiomyocytes. By using a novel Medical-In silico approach that combines conventional cell culture experiments with machine learning algorithms, we aimed to reduce a significant part of the expensive and time-consuming cell culture experiments and data generation by using computational intelligence (refinement and replacement). Cardiomyocytes exposed to HS showed an activation of the intrinsic apoptosis signal pathway via cytochrome C and the activation of caspase 3 (both p\u2009<\u20090.001). Notably, the exposure of HS resulted in the induction of necroptosis by tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 and receptor interaction protein 3 (p\u2009<\u20090.05; p\u2009<\u20090.01) and, hence, an increased level of necrotic cardiomyocytes. In conclusion, using this novel Medical-In silico approach, our data suggest (i) that HS induces necroptosis in cardiomyocytes by phosphorylation (activation) of receptor-interacting protein 3, (ii) that HS is a therapeutic target in trauma- or sepsis-associated cardiomyopathy, and (iii) indicate that this proof-of-concept is a first step toward simulating the extent of activated components in the pro-apoptotic pathway induced by HS with only a small data set gained from the in vitro experiments by using machine learning algorithms.", "Over the last decade, deep learning (DL) methods have been extremely successful and widely used to develop artificial intelligence (AI) in almost every domain, especially after it achieved its proud record on computational Go. Compared to traditional machine learning (ML) algorithms, DL methods still have a long way to go to achieve recognition in small molecular drug discovery and development. And there is still lots of work to do for the popularization and application of DL for research purpose, e.g., for small molecule drug research and development. In this review, we mainly discussed several most powerful and mainstream architectures, including the convolutional neural network (CNN), recurrent neural network (RNN), and deep auto-encoder networks (DAENs), for supervised learning and nonsupervised learning; summarized most of the representative applications in small molecule drug design; and briefly introduced how DL methods were used in those applications. The discussion for the pros and cons of DL methods as well as the main challenges we need to tackle were also emphasized.", "Deep learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that has demonstrated unprecedented performance in many medical imaging applications. Our purpose was to develop a deep learning angiography method to generate 3D cerebral angiograms from a single contrast-enhanced C-arm conebeam CT acquisition in order to reduce image artifacts and radiation dose.\nA set of 105 3D rotational angiography examinations were randomly selected from an internal data base. All were acquired using a clinical system in conjunction with a standard injection protocol. More than 150 million labeled voxels from 35 subjects were used for training. A deep convolutional neural network was trained to classify each image voxel into 3 tissue types (vasculature, bone, and soft tissue). The trained deep learning angiography model was then applied for tissue classification into a validation cohort of 8 subjects and a final testing cohort of the remaining 62 subjects. The final vasculature tissue class was used to generate the 3D deep learning angiography images. To quantify the generalization error of the trained model, we calculated the accuracy, sensitivity, precision, and Dice similarity coefficients for vasculature classification in relevant anatomy. The 3D deep learning angiography and clinical 3D rotational angiography images were subjected to a qualitative assessment for the presence of intersweep motion artifacts.\nVasculature classification accuracy and 95% CI in the testing dataset were 98.7% (98.3%-99.1%). No residual signal from osseous structures was observed for any 3D deep learning angiography testing cases except for small regions in the otic capsule and nasal cavity compared with 37% (23/62) of the 3D rotational angiographies.\nDeep learning angiography accurately recreated the vascular anatomy of the 3D rotational angiography reconstructions without a mask. Deep learning angiography reduced misregistration artifacts induced by intersweep motion, and it reduced radiation exposure required to obtain clinically useful 3D rotational angiography.", "The development of multifunctional electronic-skin that establishes human-machine interfaces, enhances perception abilities or has other distinct biomedical applications is the key to the realization of artificial intelligence. In this paper, a new self-powered (battery-free) flexible vision electronic-skin has been realized from pixel-patterned matrix of piezo-photodetecting PVDF/Ppy film. The electronic-skin under applied deformation can actively output piezoelectric voltage, and the outputting signal can be significantly influenced by UV illumination. The piezoelectric output can act as both the photodetecting signal and electricity power. The reliability is demonstrated over 200 light on-off cycles. The sensing unit matrix of 6\u00a0\u00d7\u00a06 pixels on the electronic-skin can realize image recognition through mapping multi-point UV stimuli. This self-powered vision electronic-skin that simply mimics human retina may have potential application in vision substitution.", "To examine the impact of diverse syndromes of focal and generalized epilepsy on language function in children with new and recent onset epilepsy. Of special interest was the degree of shared language abnormality across epilepsy syndromes and the unique effects associated with specific epilepsy syndromes.\nParticipants were 136 youth with new or recent-onset (diagnosis within past 12\u202fmonths) epilepsy and 107 healthy first-degree cousin controls. The participants with epilepsy included 20 with Temporal Lobe Epilepsy (TLE; M age\u202f=\u202f12.99\u202f\u00a0years, SD\u202f=\u202f3.11), 41 with Benign Epilepsy with Centrotemporal Spikes (BECTS; M age\u202f=\u202f10.32, SD\u202f=\u202f1.67), 42 with Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy (JME; M age\u202f=\u202f14.85, SD\u202f=\u202f2.75) and 33 with absence epilepsy (M age\u202f=\u202f10.55, SD\u202f=\u202f2.76). All children were administered a comprehensive test battery which included multiple measures of language and language-dependent abilities (i.e., verbal intelligence, vocabulary, verbal reasoning, object naming, reception word recognition, word reading, spelling, lexical and semantic fluency, verbal list learning and delayed verbal memory). Test scores were adjusted for age and gender and analyzed via MANCOVA.\nLanguage abnormalities were found in all epilepsy patient groups. The most broadly affected children were those with TLE and absence epilepsy, whose performance differed significantly from controls on 8 of 11 and 9 of 11 tests respectively. Although children with JME and BECTS were less affected, significant differences from controls were found on 4 of 11 tests each. While each group had a unique profile of language deficits, commonalities were apparent across both idiopathic generalized and localization-related diagnostic categories.\nThe localization related and generalized idiopathic childhood epilepsies examined here were associated with impact on diverse language abilities early in the course of the disorder.", "The role of the military physician in Deployed Hospital Care involves the diagnosis and management of a wide variety of disease states. Broad clinical skills need to be complemented by judicious use of a limited array of investigations. No study has specifically quantified what investigations physicians use on operations.\nA retrospective cross-sectional study was performed to ascertain what investigations were undertaken on all patients managed by the General Internal Medicine teams over a 14\u2009month period during a recent enduring operation in Afghanistan. A record was also made of investigations that were unavailable but considered desirable by the treating physician in order to inform clinical or occupational decisions.\n676 patients were admitted during the study period. Blood tests were performed in 96% of patients, plain radiographs in 50%, CT in 12% and ultrasound in 12%. An ECG was performed in over half (57%) and a peak flow in 11%. The most desirable, but unavailable, investigations were cardiac monitoring and echocardiography (24% and 12% of patients, respectively).\nThe data produced by this study both identified and quantified the investigations used by physicians during a mature operational deployment. This can be used in addition to accurate medical intelligence to inform and rationalise the diagnostic requirements for future operations as well as the provision of training. Technological advancements, particularly in weight and portability, are likely to enable more complex investigational modalities to be performed further forward on military deployments.", "Excess adiposity or obesity has been inversely related to cognitive function and macular xanthophyll status. However, whether the neuroprotective effects of macular xanthophylls on cognitive function are independent of excess adiposity is unclear. We investigated the relationship between macular xanthophylls and intellectual ability among adults (N = 114) between 25 and 45 years with overweight and obesity (\u226525 kg/m\u00b2). Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry and heterochromatic flicker photometry were used to assess whole body adiposity (%Fat) and macular pigment optical density (MPOD), respectively. Dietary xanthophylls (lutein and zeaxanthin) were assessed using 7-day diet records. The Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test-2 (KBIT-2) was used to assess general intelligence (IQ) as well as fluid and crystallized intelligence. Bivariate correlations revealed that MPOD was inversely related to %Fat and positively associated with IQ and fluid intelligence. Although %Fat was inversely correlated to IQ and fluid intelligence, this relationship did not persist following adjustment for sex and MPOD. Further, MPOD was an independent predictor of IQ and fluid intelligence. However, no significant relationships were observed between MPOD and crystalized intelligence. These results suggest that macular xanthophylls are selectively related to fluid intelligence, regardless of degree of adiposity among adults with overweight and obesity.", "The diagnostic proof of fungal infection in preterm infants is difficult. Antifungal treatment (AFT) is often initiated empirically when infants with suspected infection do not improve despite broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy. It was the aim of our study to determine the rate of exposure to empirical AFT in a large cohort of very low birth weight infants (VLBWI) of the German Neonatal Network and to address associated risks and outcomes.\nThe epidemiologic database consisted of n = 13,343 VLBWI born in 54 German Neonatal Network centers between 2009 and 2015. AFT was defined as number of neonates who got any dose of at least one of the following antifungal drugs: fluconazole, amphotericin B, voriconazole and caspofungin (denominator: number of infants enrolled in German Neonatal Network) for treatment (not prophylaxis) of (suspected) fungal infection. Univariate and logistic regression analyses were used to identify risk factors for exposure to AFT and associated short-term morbidities and long-term outcomes at 5-year follow-up.\nIn our cohort, 724 out of 13,343 (5.4%) VLBWI were exposed to empiric AFT and had a mean gestational age of 25.7 (\u00b12.1) weeks. Forty-four out of 13,343 (0.3%) had proven bloodstream infection with Candida spp. The main risk factors for exposure to AFT were gestational age, postnatal steroid treatment, need for abdominal surgery and use of carbapenems. Notably, AFT was associated with adverse outcomes such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia [adjusted odds ratio (OR): 1.9; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.6-2.3; P < 0.001) and retinopathy of prematurity requiring intervention (adjusted OR: 1.69; 95% CI: 1.3-2.3; P <0.001) but not mortality. In the subgroup of infants available for 5-year follow-up (n = 895), exposure to AFT was associated with a risk for cerebral palsy (adjusted OR: 2.79; 95% CI: 1.11-7.04; P = 0.04) and intelligence quotient < 85 (adjusted OR: 2.07; 95% CI: 1.01-4.28; P = 0.049).\nA significant proportion of VLBWI is exposed to AFT, specifically those born <26 weeks. Exposed infants were found to have a higher risk for adverse outcomes, which may reflect their significant vulnerability in general. Given the observational design of our study, it remains unclear whether potential side effects of empirical or target AFT itself contribute to adverse outcome. Future studies need to include risk-based strategies and stewardship programs to restrict the use of antifungal management in VLBWI.", "Diagnosis of liver disease principally depends on physician's subjective knowledge. Automatic prediction of the disease is a critical real-world medical problem. This work presents an EHC-ERF-based intelligence-integrated model purposive to predict different types of liver disease including alcoholic liver damage, primary hepatoma, liver cirrhosis, and cholelithiasis. These diseases cause many clinical complications, and their accurate assessment is the only way for providing efficient treatment facilities to patients. EHC is deployed to divide the data into a hierarchy structure that is more informative for the disease predictions carried out by ERF. The occurrence of ERF error rate was dependent on correlation and strength of each individual tree where correlation is directly proportional to forest error rate and strength is inversely proportional to the forest rate. In total, two individual and three integrated classification models are developed to achieve enhanced predictions for the liver disease types. Analysis of results showed that the proposed framework achieved better outcomes in terms of accuracy, true positive rate, precision, F-measure, kappa statistic, mean absolute error, and root mean squared error. Furthermore, it achieved the highest accuracy rates when compared with the state-of-the-art techniques. Results also indicated that the weighted distance function employed in EHC has improved the efficiency of proposed system and has shown the capability to be used by physicians for diagnostic advice.", "Biomimetic skin-like materials, capable of adapting shapes to variable environments and sensing external stimuli, are of great significance in a wide range of applications, including artificial intelligence, soft robotics, and smart wearable devices. However, such highly sophisticated intelligence has been mainly found in natural creatures while rarely realized in artificial materials. Herein, we fabricate a type of biomimetic iontronics to imitate natural skins using supramolecular polyelectrolyte hydrogels. The dynamic viscoelastic networks provide the biomimetic skin with a wide spectrum of mechanical properties, including flexible reconfiguration ability, robust elasticity, extremely large stretchability, autonomous self-healability, and recyclability. Meanwhile, polyelectrolytes' ionic conductivity allows multiple sensory capabilities toward temperature, strain, and stress. This work provides not only insights into dynamic interactions and sensing mechanism of supramolecular iontronics, but may also promote the development of biomimetic skins with sophisticated intelligence similar to natural skins.", "Many human characteristics must be evaluated to comprehensively understand an individual, and measurements of the corresponding cognition/behavior are required. Brain imaging by functional MRI (fMRI) has been widely used to examine brain function related to human cognition/behavior. However, few aspects of cognition/behavior of individuals or experimental groups can be examined through task-based fMRI. Recently, resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI) signals have been shown to represent functional infrastructure in the brain that is highly involved in processing information related to cognition/behavior. Using rs-fMRI may allow diverse information about the brain through a single MRI scan to be obtained, as rs-fMRI does not require stimulus tasks. In this study, we attempted to identify a set of functional networks representing cognition/behavior that are related to a wide variety of human characteristics and to evaluate these characteristics using rs-fMRI data. If possible, these findings would support the potential of rs-fMRI to provide diverse information about the brain. We used resting-state fMRI and a set of 130 psychometric parameters that cover most human characteristics, including those related to intelligence and emotional quotients and social ability/skill. We identified 163 brain regions by VBM analysis using regression analysis with 130 psychometric parameters. Next, using a 163 \u00d7 163 correlation matrix, we identified functional networks related to 111 of the 130 psychometric parameters. Finally, we made an 8-class support vector machine classifiers corresponding to these 111 functional networks. Our results demonstrate that rs-fMRI signals contain intrinsic information about brain function related to cognition/behaviors and that this set of 111 networks/classifiers can be used to comprehensively evaluate human characteristics.", "Being a carrier of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) \u03b54 allele is a clear risk factor for development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). On some neurocognitive tests, there are smaller differences between carriers and noncarriers, while other tests show larger differences.\nWe explore whether the size of the difference between carriers and noncarriers is a function of how well the tests measure general intelligence, so whether there are Jensen effects.\nWe used the method of correlated vectors on 441 Korean older adults at risk for AD and 44 with AD.\nCorrelations between APOE carriership and test scores ranged from -.05 to .11 (normal), and -.23 to .54 (AD). The differences between carriers and noncarriers were Jensen effects: r = .31 and r = .54, respectively.\nA composite neurocognitive score may show a clearer contrast between APOE carriers and noncarriers than a large number of scores of single neurocognitive tests.", "To analyze the findings in the background EEG activity of infants who suffered perinatal stroke.\nEleven neonates born 2009-2014 diagnosed of ischemic stroke by MRI (three of them with multistroke) underwent continuous video-EEG monitoring. Visual and spectral (power spectrum and coherence) analyses of the background EEG was performed in three moments: 1) Onset of EEG recording (prior to initiate seizure treatment), 2) Post-ictal epoch (1-2\u202fh after the last seizure), and 3) one-two days after seizure control. All children aged 2-6\u202fyears underwent neurodevelopmental assessment.\nDiscontinuity, asymmetry, asynchrony, transients, and relative power spectrum in \u03b4 and \u03b8 frequency bands increased significantly (p\u202f<\u202f0.05) in the post-ictal epoch with respect to onset of EEG recording. After seizure control, discontinuity, asynchrony, and \u03b8 power spectrum no longer had significant differences with those found at onset of EEG recording. Significant differences between the ischemic and unaffected hemispheres were found in transients and in \u03b2 coherence (p\u202f=\u202f0.002; p\u202f=\u202f0.001, respectively) exclusively in the post-ictal epoch. Seizure burden and time-to-control ranged 5-38\u202fmin and 0.5-40\u202fh respectively. Currently, only one child is affected by spastic monoparesis. The intelligence quotients ranged 96-123.\nThe background EEG can undergo significant changes in the post-ictal epoch due to the seizure activity triggered by the perinatal stroke. Most of these EEG changes involve all brain activity and not exclusively the ischemic hemisphere. Many of these modifications in the EEG background reverse following the seizure control. Video-EEG monitoring allows accurate/immediate diagnosis and rapid/intensive treatment of the stroke-associated seizures.", "Henry Herbert Donaldson (1857-1938) was a leader in neurological research in the United States for several decades, beginning about 1890. A detailed account of three of his earliest publications shows the neuroanatomical procedures involved in the study of the relation of brain and intelligence during the late-nineteenth-century in America. Two of the articles, published in September 1890 and December 1891, were titled, \"Anatomical Observations on the Brain and Several Sense-Organs of the Blind Deaf-Mute, Laura Dewy Bridgman (1829-1889)\"; the third, published in August 1892, used the information from the first two to delimit the extent of the visual processing area of the human cortex. Donaldson's procedures included brain cuttings and measures of macroscopic brain structures, histology of cellular structures, attempts to relate macroscopic brain structures with brain functions, data corrections, estimations, comparisons, and statistics. These procedures provide a view of the relative thoroughness, accuracy, and comparability of the various neuroanatomical techniques in use at that time and of Donaldson's implementation of the techniques. Donaldson's brain cutting techniques were much more comparable than his measurement techniques. The latter could be quite precise, but they were fraught with lack of standardized procedures that made corrections and estimations necessary when making data comparisons across studies. Donaldson emphasized these incompatibilities, implying a need for standardization. Statistical procedures were the least thorough and effective. His, and the field's, total complement of statistical techniques consisted of mean and range, which severely limited his ability to make complicated assessments. This limitation was not necessarily supplemented by stringent control group comparisons.", "Neonatal care advances have resulted in improved survival but have raised concerns of increase in neurodevelopmental impairment. This study looked at long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes at ages 5 and 8 years of very low birthweight infants born in the 2000s as compared to the 1990s. Neurodevelopmental assessment at 2 years old was compared to that at 5 and 8 years to determine if assessment at 2 years was predictive of later outcomes.\nA retrospective cohort study of consecutive infants with birthweight less than 1250 grams admitted to a tertiary centre in Singapore between January 1994 to December 1995 (Epoch I) and January 2004 to December 2005 (Epoch II) were included. Neurodevelopmental impairment was defined as having intelligence quotient (IQ) of less than 70, cerebral palsy, legal blindness, or hearing impairment requiring hearing aids.\nMean gestational age was lower for Epoch II compared to Epoch I (28.1 \u00b1 2.5 vs 29.4 \u00b1 2.7 weeks, P = 0.004). Death or neurodevelopmental impairment rates did not differ (24.3% and 17.1% at 5 years old, P = 0.398; 29.1% and 25.0% at 8 years old, P = 0.709). There was improvement in visual impairment rate at 8 years in Epoch II (10.7% vs 34.0%, P = 0.024). Mean IQ was better in Epoch II (109 and 107 vs 97 and 99 at 5 [P = 0.001] and 8 years [P = 0.047], respectively). All infants with no neurodevelopmental impairment at 2 years remained without impairment later on.\nOver a decade, neurodevelopmental outcomes did not worsen despite lower mean gestational age. Long- term improvement in IQ scores and a reduction in visual impairment rates were seen. Our data suggests that children without neurodevelopmental impairment at 2 years are without impairment later on; therefore, they may need only developmental monitoring with targeted assessments instead of routine formal IQ assessments.", "Researchers have frequently reported an age-related decline in semantic processing during sentence comprehension. However, it remains unclear whether syntactic processing also declines or whether it remains constant as people age. In the present study, 26 younger adults and 20 older adults were recruited and matched in terms of working memory, general intelligence, verbal intelligence and fluency. They were then asked to make semantic acceptability judgments while completing a Chinese sentence reading task. The behavioral results revealed that the older adults had significantly lower accuracy on measures of semantic and syntactic processing compared to younger adults. Event-related potential (ERP) results showed that during semantic processing, older adults had a significantly reduced amplitude and delayed peak latency of the N400 compared to the younger adults. During syntactic processing, older adults also showed delayed peak latency of the P600 relative to younger adults. Moreover, while P600 amplitude was comparable between the two age groups, larger P600 amplitude was associated with worse performance only in the older adults. Together, the behavioral and ERP data suggest that there is an age-related decline in both semantic and syntactic processing, with a trend toward lower efficiency in syntactic ability.", "Parents and physicians may have different understandings of a child's risk of future limitations due to cancer or cancer treatment. We evaluated alignment between parent- and physician-estimated risk of late effects.\nWe surveyed 352 parents of children with cancer within 12\u00a0weeks of diagnosis, and the children's oncologists, at Dana-Farber/Boston Children's Cancer and Blood Disorders Center and Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. We assessed parent and physician estimations of the child's risk of future limitations in physical abilities, intelligence, or quality of life (QOL) due to cancer treatment. Physician-estimated risk of limitations \u226550% was considered high risk.\nPhysicians considered 22% of children at high risk of physical impairments, 9% at high risk for impaired intelligence, and 6% at high risk for impaired QOL. Among high-risk children, 38% of parents recognized this risk in physical abilities, 21% in intelligence, and 5% in QOL. In multivariable analysis, parental understanding of risk, defined as concordant parent and physician estimates, was greater among parents of children at lower risk of future limitations (odds ratio 2.59; 95% confidence interval 1.35-4.96). Regardless of risk, 92% of parents considered it very/extremely important to receive information about potential health implications of cancer treatment.\nAlthough most parents want information about life after cancer, most parents of children at high risk of future impairment do not recognize this risk. Strategies to improve communication about late effects throughout pediatric cancer treatment should prioritize meeting information needs and improving parent understanding of the risk of impairment.", "Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) requires prompt diagnosis to optimize patient outcomes. We hypothesized that machine learning algorithms could automatically analyze computed tomography (CT) of the head, prioritize radiology worklists and reduce time to diagnosis of ICH. 46,583 head CTs (~2 million images) acquired from 2007-2017 were collected from several facilities across Geisinger. A deep convolutional neural network was trained on 37,074 studies and subsequently evaluated on 9499 unseen studies. The predictive model was implemented prospectively for 3 months to re-prioritize \"routine\" head CT studies as \"stat\" on realtime radiology worklists if an ICH was detected. Time to diagnosis was compared between the re-prioritized \"stat\" and \"routine\" studies. A neuroradiologist blinded to the study reviewed false positive studies to determine whether the dictating radiologist overlooked ICH. The model achieved an area under the ROC curve of 0.846 (0.837-0.856). During implementation, 94 of 347 \"routine\" studies were re-prioritized to \"stat\", and 60/94 had ICH identified by the radiologist. Five new cases of ICH were identified, and median time to diagnosis was significantly reduced (p\u2009<\u20090.0001) from 512 to 19\u2009min. In particular, one outpatient with vague symptoms on anti-coagulation was found to have an ICH which was treated promptly with reversal of anticoagulation, resulting in a good clinical outcome. Of the 34 false positives, the blinded over-reader identified four probable ICH cases overlooked in original interpretation. In conclusion, an artificial intelligence algorithm can prioritize radiology worklists to reduce time to diagnosis of new outpatient ICH by 96% and may also identify subtle ICH overlooked by radiologists. This demonstrates the positive impact of advanced machine learning in radiology workflow optimization.", "The aim of this study was to investigate the safety and the effects of elevated doses of solifenacin and trospium on cognitive function and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in elderly women receiving treatment for urinary incontinence.\nThe study included 312 women aged 60-83 years (mean age, 69.4 years). All participants had scored at least 24 points on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scale, and all of them had been diagnosed with urge urinary incontinence (UUI) or mixed urinary incontinence (MUI). The women were randomly assigned to 3 groups: group A, individuals who were simultaneously administered solifenacin at a high dosage of 20 mg per day and trospium at a high dosage of 60 mg per day; group B, persons taking solifenacin and trospium at the usual dosage of 10 and 30 mg per day, respectively; and group C, persons who received a placebo. Participants' cognitive status was assessed by the MMSE, Controlled Oral Word Association Test, Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised, Wechsler Memory Scale III, Colour Trails Test, and California Verbal Learning Test scales. The HRQoL assessment was performed using the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Health Survey.\nThe cognitive function parameters did not differ at the start and end of the study across the groups (P>0.05). Additionally, the cognitive function parameters did not differ significantly within each group between the start and end of the study (P>0.05). The values of most HRQoL parameters regarding the functional state of the lower urinary tract (LUT) after the termination of treatment significantly improved in groups A and B (P<0.05). A significant correlation between cognitive status and HRQoL or LUT parameters was absent (r<0.3), while the correlations between HRQoL and LUT parameters were r=0.31-0.83, P<0.05.\nThe use of elevated doses of solifenacin and trospium did not increase the risk of cognitive impairment in women with UUI and MUI. The combination of solifenacin and trospium at a double dosage may be recommended to elderly women with treatment-resistant symptoms of UUI and MUI. However, the safety of combining antimuscarinic drugs in women with an increased volume of residual urine requires further study.", "Autism is characterised by impaired social communication and restricted repetitive behaviours. However, language and intelligence are spared in high-functioning individuals. The symptomatology is complex and culturally diverse. Buddhists and Hindus believe in rebirth and reincarnation type presentations in children are frequently seen among these populations. Here we describe three children from Sri Lanka claiming memories of their past lives and later diagnosed to have high-functioning autism. The first, a seven-year-old Buddhist believes he was killed by terrorists as a soldier in his previous life and attributed his birthmark to be an injury which caused death. The second, a five-year-old Catholic girl suffering from asthma claiming she died of breathing difficulties in her previous life where she was a Buddhist grandmother. The third, an eight-year-old academically superior child claims he was a monk in his previous life and demands parents to allow him to enter the priesthood.", "An important aspect of the educational and psychological evaluation of individuals is the selection of scales with appropriate evidence of reliability and validity for inferences and uses of the scores for the population of interest. One key aspect of validity is the degree to which a scale fairly assesses the construct(s) of interest for members of different subgroups within the population. Typically, this issue is addressed statistically through assessment of differential item functioning (DIF) of individual items, or differential test functioning (DTF) of sets of items within the same measure. When selecting an assessment to use for a given application (e.g., measuring intelligence), or which form of an assessment to use for a test administration, researchers need to consider the extent to which the scales work with all members of the population. Little research has examined methods for comparing the amount or magnitude of DIF/DTF present in two or more assessments when deciding which assessment to use. The current study made use of 7 different statistics for this purpose, in the context of intelligence testing. Results demonstrate that by using a variety of effect sizes, the researcher can gain insights into not only which scales may contain the least amount of DTF, but also how they differ with regard to the way in which the DTF manifests itself.", "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in epilepsy has been a topic of increasing interest, which in general occurs in 15-35% of the patients with epilepsy, more frequently in those with intellectual disability (ID). Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) and Dravet syndrome (DS) are two typical forms of intractable epileptic encephalopathy associated with ID. We previously reported that ASD was diagnosed in 24.3% of patients with DS, higher in those with profound ID. Given the severe epilepsy and high frequency of ID in LGS, it is necessary to know whether ASD is a common psychomotor co-morbidity of LGS. This study evaluated the autistic behaviors and intelligence in patients with LGS and further compared that between LGS and DS, aiming to understand the complex pathogenesis of epilepsy-ASD-ID triad.\nA total of 50 patients with LGS and 45 patients with DS were enrolled and followed up for at least 3\u00a0years. The clinical characteristics were analyzed, and evaluations of ASD and ID were performed.\nNo patients with LGS fully met the diagnostic criteria for ASD, but three of them exhibited more or less autistic behaviors. Majority (86%) of LGS patients presented ID, among which moderate to severe ID was the most common. Early onset age and symptomatic etiology were risk predictors for ID. The prevalence of ASD in LGS was significantly lower than that in DS (0/50 vs. 10/45, p\u2009<\u20090.001), while the prevalence and severity of ID showed no significant difference between the two forms of epileptic encephalopathy.\nThis study demonstrated a significant difference in the co-morbidity of ASD between LGS and DS, although they had a similar prevalence and severity of ID, refuting the proposal that the prevalence of ASD in epilepsy is accounted for by ID. These findings suggest that the co-morbidity of ASD, ID, and epilepsy may result from multifaceted pathogenic mechanisms.", "Smart skin is expected to be stretchable and tactile for bionic robots as the medium with the ambient environment. Here, a stretchable triboelectric-photonic smart skin (STPS) is reported that enables multidimensional tactile and gesture sensing for a robotic hand. With a grating-structured metal film as the bioinspired skin stripe, the STPS exhibits a tunable aggregation-induced emission in a lateral tensile range of 0-160%. Moreover, the STPS can be used as a triboelectric nanogenerator for vertical pressure sensing with a maximum sensitivity of 34 mV Pa-1 . The pressure sensing characteristics can remain stable in different stretching conditions, which demonstrates a synchronous and independent sensing property for external stimuli with great durability. By integrating on a robotic hand as a conformal covering, the STPS shows multidimensional mechanical sensing abilities for external touch and different gestures with joints bending. This work has first demonstrated a triboelectric-photonic coupled multifunctional sensing terminal, which may have great applications in human-machine interaction, soft robots, and artificial intelligence.", "Intelligence and educational attainment are strongly genetically correlated. This relationship can be exploited by Multi-Trait Analysis of GWAS (MTAG) to add power to Genome-wide Association Studies (GWAS) of intelligence. MTAG allows the user to meta-analyze GWASs of different phenotypes, based on their genetic correlations, to identify association's specific to the trait of choice. An MTAG analysis using GWAS data sets on intelligence and education was conducted by Lam et al. (2017). Lam et al. (2017) reported 70 loci that they described as 'trait specific' to intelligence. This article examines whether the analysis conducted by Lam et al. (2017) has resulted in genetic information about a phenotype that is more similar to education than intelligence.", "Epidemiologic studies link maternal seafood and n-3 (\u03c9-3) polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) consumption with improved childhood cognitive development; trials show mixed results.\nWe investigated effects of n-3 PUFA supplementation on child cognitive and visual outcomes.\nWe systematically reviewed and meta-analyzed randomized controlled trials of n-3 PUFA supplementation in mothers or infants (age\u00a0\u22642 y) and evaluated standardized measures of cognitive or visual development up to age 18 y. Of 6286 abstracts and 669 full-text articles, 38 trials with 53 intervention arms were included. Data were extracted independently in duplicate. Findings were pooled using random-effects meta-analysis across supplementation periods (maternal, preterm, term infant); we also explored subgroup analyses stratified by supplementation period. Heterogeneity was explored using I2, stratified analysis, and meta-regression. Cognitive development was assessed by Bayley Scales of Infant Development mental and psychomotor developmental indexes (MDI, PDI) and intelligence quotient (IQ); visual acuity was assessed by electrophysiological or behavioral measures.\nThe 38 trials (mothers: n\u00a0=\u00a013; preterm infants: n\u00a0=\u00a07; term infants: n\u00a0=\u00a018) included 5541 participants. When we explored effects during different periods of supplementation, n-3 PUFA supplementation improved MDI in preterm infants (3.33; 95% CI: 0.72, 5.93), without statistically significant effects on PDI or IQ in different intervention period subgroups. Visual acuity [measured as the logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR)] was improved by supplementation in preterm (-0.08 logMAR; 95% CI: -0.14, -0.01 logMAR) and term infants (-0.08 logMAR; 95% CI: -0.11, -0.05 logMAR), with a nonsignificant trend for maternal supplementation (-0.02 logMAR; 95% CI: -0.04, 0.00 logMAR). In main analyses pooling all supplementation periods, compared with placebo, n-3 PUFA supplementation improved MDI (n\u00a0=\u00a021 trials; 0.91; 95% CI: 0.005, 1.81; P\u00a0=\u00a00.049), PDI (n\u00a0=\u00a021 trials; 1.06 higher index; 95% CI: 0.10, 2.03; P\u00a0=\u00a00.031), and visual acuity (n\u00a0=\u00a024; -0.063 logMAR; 95% CI: -0.084, -0.041 logMAR; P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) but not IQ (n\u00a0=\u00a07; 0.20; 95% CI: -1.56, 1.96, P\u00a0=\u00a00.83), although few studies assessed this endpoint. Potential publication bias was identified for MDI (Eggers P\u00a0=\u00a00.005), but not other endpoints. Significant differences in findings were not identified by world region, race, maternal education, age at outcome assessment, supplementation duration, DHA or EPA dose, DHA:AA ratio, or study quality score (P-interaction\u00a0>\u00a00.05 each).\nn-3 PUFA supplementation improves childhood psychomotor and visual development, without significant effects on global IQ later in childhood, although the latter conclusion is based on fewer studies.", "Distinguishable detection of the ultraviolet, visible, and infrared spectrum is promising and significant for the super visual system of artificial intelligences. However, it is challenging to provide a photosensor with such broad spectral response ability. In this work, the ultraviolet, visible, and infrared spectrum is distinguished by developing serial photosensors based on perovskite/carbon nanotube hybrids. Oraganolead halide perovskites (CH3 NH3 PbX3 ) possess remarkable optoelectronic properties and tunable optical band gaps by changing the halogens, and integration with single-walled carbon nanotubes can further improve their photoresponsivities. The CH3 NH3 PbCl3 -based photosensor shows a responsivity up to 105 A W-1 to ultraviolet and no obvious response to visible light, which is superior to that of most ultraviolet sensors. The CH3 NH3 PbBr3 -based photosensor exhibits a high responsivity to visible light. Serial devices of the two hybrid photosensors with comparable electric and sensory performances can distinguish the spectrum of ultraviolet, visible, and infrared even with varying light intensities. The photosensors also demonstrate excellent mechanical flexibility and bending stability. By taking full advantages of the oraganolead halide perovskites, this work provides flexible high-responsivity photosensors specialized for ultraviolet, and gives a simple strategy for distinguishable detection of ultraviolet, visible, and infrared spectrum based on the serial flexible photosensors.", "Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) has become a powerful tool to probe molecule events in biological tissue. However, it is a widely held viewpoint that one of the biggest challenges is an easy-to-use data processing software for discovering the underlying biological information from complicated and huge MSI dataset. Here, a user-friendly and full-featured MSI software including three subsystems, Solution, Visualization and Intelligence, named MassImager, is developed focusing on interactive visualization, in-situ biomarker discovery and artificial intelligent pathological diagnosis. Simplified data preprocessing and high-throughput MSI data exchange, serialization jointly guarantee the quick reconstruction of ion image and rapid analysis of dozens of gigabytes datasets. It also offers diverse self-defined operations for visual processing, including multiple ion visualization, multiple channel superposition, image normalization, visual resolution enhancement and image filter. Regions-of-interest analysis can be performed precisely through the interactive visualization between the ion images and mass spectra, also the overlaid optical image guide, to directly find out the region-specific biomarkers. Moreover, automatic pattern recognition can be achieved immediately upon the supervised or unsupervised multivariate statistical modeling. Clear discrimination between cancer tissue and adjacent tissue within a MSI dataset can be seen in the generated pattern image, which shows great potential in visually in-situ biomarker discovery and artificial intelligent pathological diagnosis of cancer. All the features are integrated together in MassImager to provide a deep MSI processing solution at the in-situ metabolomics level for biomarker discovery and future clinical pathological diagnosis.", "An imbalance in the inflammatory tumor necrosis factor system, including soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor 2 (sTNFR2), may contribute to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.\nWe measured the plasma levels of sTNFR2 in 256 healthy controls and 250 patients with schizophrenia including antipsychotic drug-free patients and treatment-resistant patients. We also explored the possible association between plasma sTNFR2 levels and cognitive performance in healthy controls and patients with schizophrenia using the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, Third Edition, the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised, and the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test. An association between plasma sTNFR2 levels and hippocampal volume in controls and patients with schizophrenia was also investigated via MRI.\nWe found that the plasma levels of sTNFR2 were significantly higher in patients with schizophrenia, including both antipsychotic drug-free patients and treatment-resistant patients. We found a significant negative association between plasma sTNFR2 levels and cognitive performance in controls and patients with schizophrenia. Hippocampal volume was also negatively associated with plasma sTNFR2 levels in patients with schizophrenia.\nTogether, these convergent data suggest a possible biological mechanism for schizophrenia, whereby increased sTNFR2 levels are associated with a smaller hippocampal volume and cognitive impairment.", "In 2017, a new paradigm change caused by artificial intelligence and big data analysis resulted in innovation in each field of science and technology, and also significantly influenced progress in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine (TERM). TERM has continued to make technological advances based on interdisciplinary approaches and has contributed to the overall field of biomedical technology, including cancer biology, personalized medicine, development biology, and cell-based therapeutics. While researchers are aware that there is still a long way to go until TERM reaches the ultimate goal of patient treatment through clinical translation, the rapid progress in convergence studies led by technological improvements in TERM has been encouraging. In this review, we highlighted the significant advances made in TERM in 2017 (with an overlap of 5 months in 2016). We identified major progress in TERM in a manner similar to previous reviews published in the last few years. In addition, we carefully considered all four previous reviews during the selection process and chose main themes that minimize the duplication of the topics. Therefore, we have identified three areas that have been the focus of most journal publications in the TERM community in 2017: (i) advanced biomaterials and three-dimensional (3D) cell printing, (ii) exosomes as bioactive agents for regenerative medicine, and (iii) 3D culture in regenerative medicine.", "Since Hooker, Finkelman and Schwartzman (Psychometrika 74(3): 419-442, 2009) it is known that person parameter estimates from multidimensional latent variable models can induce unfair classifications via paradoxical scoring effects. The open question as to whether there is a fair and at the same time multidimensional scoring scheme with adequate statistical properties is addressed in this paper. We develop a theorem on the existence of a fair, multidimensional classification scheme in the context of the classical linear factor analysis model and show how the computation of the scoring scheme can be embedded in the context of linear programming. The procedure is illustrated in the framework of scoring the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS-IV).", "To study the prevalence of minor neurological dysfunction (MND) at 6\u00a0years of age in a cohort of children born extremely preterm without cerebral palsy (CP) and to investigate associations with motor function, cognitive abilities, and behaviour.\nThis study assessed 80 children born at less than 27\u00a0weeks of gestation and 90 children born at term age between 2004 and 2007 at a mean age of 6\u00a0years 6\u00a0months. The assessments included a simplified version of the Touwen Infant Neurological Examination, the Movement Assessment Battery for Children, Second Edition (MABC-2), Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, Fourth Edition (WISC-IV), the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), and the parent version of the Five to Fifteen questionnaire.\nFifty-one of the children born preterm had normal neurology, 23 had simple MND, and six had complex MND compared with 88 who had normal neurology and two simple MND in the term-born group (p<0.001). There were significant differences between the children with normal neurology and MND in the preterm group in MABC-2-assessed motor function (p<0.001), general cognitive abilities with WISC-IV (p=0.005), and SDQ overall behavioural problems and peer problems reported by the parents (p=0.021 and p=0.003 respectively). SDQ teacher-reported overall behavioural and hyperactivity problems were significantly different between children with normal and simple MND (p=0.036 and p=0.019).\nChildren born extremely preterm, in the absence of CP, are at risk of MND and this is associated with motor function, cognitive ability, and behaviour.\nExtremely preterm birth carries a risk of minor neurological dysfunction (MND). MND in children born extremely preterm is associated with impaired motor function and cognitive abilities, and behavioural problems. Male sex is associated with MND in children born extremely preterm.", "To assess the impact of perioperative neonatal brain injury and brain volumes on neurodevelopment throughout school-age children with critical congenital heart disease (CHD).\nThirty-four survivors of neonatal cardiac surgery (seven females, 27 males) were included. Neonatal preoperative and postoperative cerebral magnetic resonance imaging was performed and neurodevelopment was assessed at 24\u00a0months (SD 0.7, n=32, using Bayley Score of Infant and Toddler Development, Child Behavior Checklist) and 6\u00a0years (mean age 5y 11mo; SD 0.3, n=30, using Movement Assessment Battery for Children, Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence, Child Behavior Checklist, Teacher Report Form). Brain injury, brain volumes, and cortical measures were related to outcome with adjustment for maternal educational level.\nTwo-year cognitive score and 6-year Full-scale IQ were poorer in children with neonatal white matter injury (n=21, all p<0.05), with higher teacher-reported attention problems (p=0.03). Five of six children with involvement of the posterior limb of the internal capsule showed motor problems (p=0.03). Children with a below-average Fulll-scale IQ (<85, n=9) showed smaller volumes of basal ganglia thalami (-8%, p=0.03) and brain stem (-7%, p=0.03).\nOur findings provide evidence of unfavourable outcome in school-age children with critical CHD who acquire perioperative neonatal brain injury.\nThis paper extends knowledge about neonatal brain injury and long-term outcome in congenital heart disease. Children with white matter injury show lower IQ and more attention problems at school age. Injury of the posterior limb of the internal capsule increases the risk of motor problems. This study provides evidence for worse outcomes in neonates acquiring brain injury around cardiac surgery.", "Utilizing technology for automated item generation is not a new idea. However, test items used in commercial testing programs or in research are still predominantly written by humans, in most cases by content experts or professional item writers. Human experts are a limited resource and testing agencies incur high costs in the process of continuous renewal of item banks to sustain testing programs. Using algorithms instead holds the promise of providing unlimited resources for this crucial part of assessment development. The approach presented here deviates in several ways from previous attempts to solve this problem. In the past, automatic item generation relied either on generating clones of narrowly defined item types such as those found in language free intelligence tests (e.g., Raven's progressive matrices) or on an extensive analysis of task components and derivation of schemata to produce items with pre-specified variability that are hoped to have predictable levels of difficulty. It is somewhat unlikely that researchers utilizing these previous approaches would look at the proposed approach with favor; however, recent applications of machine learning show success in solving tasks that seemed impossible for machines not too long ago. The proposed approach uses deep learning to implement probabilistic language models, not unlike what Google brain and Amazon Alexa use for language processing and generation.", "Emotional intelligence (EI) can buffer potentially harmful effects of situational and chronic stressors to safeguard psychological wellbeing (e.g., Mikolajczak, Petrides, Coumans & Luminet, ), yet understanding how and when EI operates to promote adaptation remains a research priority. We explored whether EI (both trait and ability) modulated early attentional processing of threat-related emotion under conditions of stress. Using a dot probe paradigm, eye movement (fixation to emotive facial stimuli, relative to neutral) and manual reaction time data were collected from 161 adults aged 18-57 years (mean age = 25.24; SD = 8.81) exposed to either a stressful (failure task) or non-stressful (control) situation. Whilst emotion management ability and trait wellbeing corresponded to avoidance of negative emotion (angry and sad respectively), high trait sociability and emotionality related to a bias for negative emotions. With most effects not restricted to stressful conditions, it is unclear whether EI underscores 'adaptive' processing, which carries implications for school-based social and emotional learning programs.", "Despite decades of ground-breaking research in academia, organic synthesis is still a rate-limiting factor in drug-discovery projects. Here we present some current challenges in synthetic organic chemistry from the perspective of the pharmaceutical industry and highlight problematic steps that, if overcome, would find extensive application in the discovery of transformational medicines. Significant synthesis challenges arise from the fact that drug molecules typically contain amines and N-heterocycles, as well as unprotected polar groups. There is also a need for new reactions that enable non-traditional disconnections, more C-H bond activation and late-stage functionalization, as well as stereoselectively substituted aliphatic heterocyclic ring synthesis, C-X or C-C bond formation. We also emphasize that syntheses compatible with biomacromolecules will find increasing use, while new technologies such as machine-assisted approaches and artificial intelligence for synthesis planning have the potential to dramatically accelerate the drug-discovery process. We believe that increasing collaboration between academic and industrial chemists is crucial to address the challenges outlined here.", "This study aimed to investigate the association between white matter tracts and multiple aspects of attention and working memory deficits in a relatively acute traumatic brain injury (TBI) sample.\nNeuropsychological measures of attention and working memory were administered to 20 participants with complicated mild-to-very severe TBI and 20 control participants. Tract-based spatial statistics was used to assess fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) of white matter tracts for 15 TBI participants and 20 controls.\nWhen compared to controls, participants with TBI were found to have lower FA (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and higher MD (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) values in the majority of white matter tracts. TBI participants were also slower to complete tasks including Trail Making Test, Hayling, computerized Selective Attention Task, n-back and Symbol Digit Modalities Test (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), when compared to controls. When controlling for age and estimated premorbid intelligence, slowed information processing speed following TBI was found to be associated with FA values in the corpus callosum, superior longitudinal fasciculus, cingulum, inferior fronto-occipital fasciculi, corona radiata and cerebral white matter.\nThe results highlight the widespread damage associated with TBI, as well as the impact of these alterations on information processing speed.", "A novel approach is presented for group statistical analysis of diffusion weighted MRI datasets through voxelwise Orientation Distribution Functions (ODF). Recent advances in MRI acquisition make it possible to use high quality diffusion weighted protocols (multi-shell, large number of gradient directions) for routine in vivo study of white matter architecture. The dimensionality of these data sets is however often reduced to simplify statistical analysis. While these approaches may detect large group differences, they do not fully capitalize on all acquired image volumes. Incorporation of all available diffusion information in the analysis however risks biasing the outcome by outliers. Here we propose a statistical analysis method operating on the ODF, either the diffusion ODF or fiber ODF. To avoid outlier bias and reliably detect voxelwise group differences and correlations with demographic or behavioral variables, we apply the Low-Rank plus Sparse (L+S) matrix decomposition on the voxelwise ODFs which separates the sparse individual variability in the sparse matrix S whilst recovering the essential ODF features in the low-rank matrix L. We demonstrate the performance of this ODF L+S approach by replicating the established negative association between global white matter integrity and physical obesity in the Human Connectome dataset. The volume of positive findings p<0.01,227cm3, agrees with and expands on the volume found by TBSS (17\u202fcm3), Connectivity based fixel enhancement (15\u202fcm3) and Connectometry (212\u202fcm3). In the same dataset we further localize the correlations of brain structure with neurocognitive measures such as fluid intelligence and episodic memory. The presented ODF L+S approach will aid in the full utilization of all acquired diffusion weightings leading to the detection of smaller group differences in clinically relevant settings as well as in neuroscience applications.", "[Purpose] The purpose of this study was to present the effects of Interactive metronome (IM) on timing for children with Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). [Subjects and Methods] The subjects of the present study were 2 children diagnosed with ADHD. Pre- and post-intervention tests were completed by the researcher using Long Form Assessment (LFA) test of IM and K-WPPSI-IV. The subjects were provided with IM for 40 minutes at a time, 2 times per week, for a total of 8 weeks. [Results] The timing decreased after IM intervention. The subjects showed improvement in attention span after IM intervention. Working memory index as well as processing speed index were increased after intervention, as shown by the Korean-Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence-IV (K-WPPSI-IV). [Conclusion] IM was effective in improving timing, attention, working memory and processing speed in children with ADHD.", "There are few literature evidences about the intellectual profile of adolescents with headache and no study has used the fourth edition of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC-IV) in patients with a diagnosis of headache according to the ICHD-III-beta. We recruited 30 patients (age 11-14\u2009years; male:female\u2009=\u20091:2) seen for headache in a tertiary center in Northern Italy and 30 healthy controls matched for age and sex, recruited in a public school from the same geographic area. The diagnosis of headache was done according to the ICHD-III criteria (beta version): the case group was composed of 16 patients with migraine and 14 with tension-type headache. Cognitive functioning was assessed using the WISC-IV. Recruited patients with idiopathic headache diagnosis had on average a cognitive function within the normal range. We found no statistically significant differences in the total Intellective Quotient comparing patients with headache and controls; the Working Memory Index was, however, lower in patients with headache (p\u2009=\u20090.012), and in particular, we found a lower Digit Span (p\u2009<\u20090.001). We also found a borderline statistical difference (p\u2009=\u20090.051) between case and controls Verbal Comprehension Index (CVI), which was due to a lower score in the Similarities subtest (p\u2009<\u20090.001). Our results suggest that, although within normal limits, cognitive functioning of adolescents with headache differs from that of healthy peers regarding memory and verbal skills. The Working Memory Index is related to the subject's ability to store new information and keep them in short-term memory, to maintain focused attention and to manipulate them to find solutions. The difference in Similarities is also important because it provides a measure of the level of verbal reasoning and concept formation; it is also a measure of verbal abstract thinking skills relevant for language development, lexical knowledge, auditory comprehension, memory, and ability to discriminate between essential and non-essential characteristics. Our data, in keep with previous findings, suggest the need for further researches to better understand the pathogenesis of these difficulties and obtain ideas for an adequate rehabilitative treatment.", "To evaluate impact of neurological injury on cognitive performance it is typically necessary to derive a baseline (or \"premorbid\") estimate of a patient's general cognitive ability prior to the onset of impairment. In this paper, we consider a range of common methods for producing this estimate, including those based on current best performance, embedded \"hold/no-hold\" tests, demographic information, and word reading ability. Ninety-two neurologically healthy adult participants were assessed on the full Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale - Fourth Edition (WAIS-IV; Wechsler, D. (2008). Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (4th ed.). San Antonio, TX: Pearson Assessment.) and on two widely used word reading tests: National Adult Reading Test (NART; Nelson, H. E. (1982). National Adult Reading Test (NART): For the assessment of premorbid intelligence in patients with dementia: Test manual. Windsor: NFER-Nelson.; Nelson, H. E., & Willison, J. (1991). National Adult Reading Test (NART). Windsor: NFER-Nelson.) and Wechsler Test of Adult Reading (WTAR; Wechsler, D. (2001). Wechsler Test of Adult Reading: WTAR. San Antonio, TX: Psychological Corporation.). Our findings indicate that reading tests provide the most reliable and precise estimates of WAIS-IV full-scale IQ, although the addition of demographic data provides modest improvement. Nevertheless, we observed considerable variability in correlations between NART/WTAR scores and individual WAIS-IV indices, which indicated particular usefulness in estimating more crystallised premorbid abilities (as represented by the verbal comprehension and general ability indices) relative to fluid abilities (working memory and perceptual reasoning indices). We discuss and encourage the development of new methods for improving premorbid estimates of cognitive abilities in neurological patients.", "Recent developments in intelligence surveillance camera systems have enabled more research on the detection, tracking, and recognition of humans. Such systems typically use visible light cameras and images, in which shadows make it difficult to detect and recognize the exact human area. Near-infrared (NIR) light cameras and thermal cameras are used to mitigate this problem. However, such instruments require a separate NIR illuminator, or are prohibitively expensive. Existing research on shadow detection in images captured by visible light cameras have utilized object and shadow color features for detection. Unfortunately, various environmental factors such as illumination change and brightness of background cause detection to be a difficult task. To overcome this problem, we propose a convolutional neural network-based shadow detection method. Experimental results with a database built from various outdoor surveillance camera environments, and from the context-aware vision using image-based active recognition (CAVIAR) open database, show that our method outperforms previous works.", "During childhood, the brain can consume up to 65% of total calories, and a steady supply of the brain's main fuel glucose needs to be maintained. Although the brain itself is not dependent on insulin for the uptake of glucose, insulin plays an important role in energy homeostasis. Thus, the risk for insulin resistance during brain development may negatively impact the whole brain volume.\nWe investigated the link between the insulin resistance and the whole brain volume as measured by structural Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in 46 unmedicated depressed and overweight youths between the ages of 9 and 17\u2009years.\nSmaller whole brain volumes were associated with insulin resistance independent of age, sex, depression severity, body mass index, socioeconomic status, Tanner Stage, and Intelligence quotient (IQ) (r = 0.395, P = .014)\nThere may be a significant cost for developing insulin resistance on the developing brain. Disentangling the precise relationship between the insulin resistance and the developing brain is critical.", "The purpose of this study was to investigate the incremental validity of a set of domain general cognitive measures added to a traditional screening battery of early numeracy measures. The sample consisted of 458 kindergarten students of whom 285 were designated as severely at-risk for mathematics difficulty. Hierarchical multiple regression results indicated that Wechsler Abbreviated Scales of Intelligence (WASI) Matrix Reasoning and Vocabulary subtests, and Digit Span Forward and Backward measures explained a small, but unique portion of the variance in kindergarten students' mathematics performance on the Test of Early Mathematics Ability-Third Edition (TEMA-3) when controlling for Early Numeracy Curriculum Based Measurement (EN-CBM) screening measures (R\u00b2 change = .01). Furthermore, the incremental validity of the domain general cognitive measures was relatively stronger for the severely at-risk sample. We discuss results from the study in light of instructional decision-making and note the findings do not justify adding domain general cognitive assessments to mathematics screening batteries.

The possibility of determining its characteristics over time will have a great impact on the prognosis and predictions that can be made. In that regard, the intelligence quotient and its possible stability throughout the life cycle can help to better define the phenotype of the disorder and its associated needs.\nLongitudinal studies show a certain level of stability in intelligence quotient scores, especially starting from the school years. Before, in the preschool stage, there is greater variability, especially in those children who have a borderline intellectual functioning or moderate intellectual disability.\nMore research should continue to be developed to know the cognitive profile of people with autism spectrum disorder and be able to make predictions based on their intellectual functioning.\nAutismo y cociente intelectual: estabilidad?\nIntroduccion. El autismo es un trastorno heterogeneo. La posibilidad de determinar sus caracteristicas a lo largo del tiempo tendra una gran repercusion en el pronostico y las predicciones que se puedan hacer. En ese sentido, el cociente intelectual y su posible estabilidad a lo largo del ciclo vital pueden ayudar a definir mejor el fenotipo del trastorno y sus necesidades asociadas. Desarrollo. Los estudios longitudinales muestran cierta estabilidad en las puntuaciones del cociente intelectual, sobre todo a partir de los a\u00f1os escolares. Antes, en la etapa preescolar, existe mayor variabilidad, especialmente en aquellos ni\u00f1os que tienen un funcionamiento intelectual limite o discapacidad intelectual moderada. Conclusion.

The present study examined PM in daily cannabis users who were either dependent (n\u2009=\u200918) or non-dependent (n\u2009=\u200918), and compared them with non-using controls (n\u2009=\u200918). The effect of future event simulation (FES) on PM performance was also examined. Participants were matched across groups on age, gender, and highest level of education. The virtual week (VW) was used to objectively assess PM abilities, both at baseline and following FES. Other measures used were: cannabis use variables, immediate and delayed prose recall, phonemic and category fluency, spot-the-word test (premorbid intelligence), Beck Depression Inventory, Beck Anxiety Inventory, and a measure of schizotypy (Oxford-Liverpool Inventory of Feelings and Experiences: unusual experiences subscale). No group differences were found in PM performance on the VW, and FES did not improve PM performance in any group. Dependent cannabis users scored higher on depression, anxiety, and schizotypy than both other groups with non-dependent cannabis users scoring at a similar level to controls. There were no group differences in alcohol use. Findings suggest that when carefully matched on baseline variables, and not differing in premorbid IQ or alcohol use, young, near-daily cannabis users do not differ from non-using controls in PM performance.", "To develop an artificial intelligence (AI)-based algorithm which can automatically detect food items from images acquired by an egocentric wearable camera for dietary assessment.\nTo study human diet and lifestyle, large sets of egocentric images were acquired using a wearable device, called eButton, from free-living individuals. Three thousand nine hundred images containing real-world activities, which formed eButton data set 1, were manually selected from thirty subjects. eButton data set 2 contained 29 515 images acquired from a research participant in a week-long unrestricted recording. They included both food- and non-food-related real-life activities, such as dining at both home and restaurants, cooking, shopping, gardening, housekeeping chores, taking classes, gym exercise, etc. All images in these data sets were classified as food/non-food images based on their tags generated by a convolutional neural network.\nA cross data-set test was conducted on eButton data set 1. The overall accuracy of food detection was 91\u00b75 and 86\u00b74 %, respectively, when one-half of data set 1 was used for training and the other half for testing. For eButton data set 2, 74\u00b70 % sensitivity and 87\u00b70 % specificity were obtained if both 'food' and 'drink' were considered as food images. Alternatively, if only 'food' items were considered, the sensitivity and specificity reached 85\u00b70 and 85\u00b78 %, respectively.\nThe AI technology can automatically detect foods from low-quality, wearable camera-acquired real-world egocentric images with reasonable accuracy, reducing both the burden of data processing and privacy concerns.", "In recent years it has become popular on the internet to debate the IQ of the incumbent president of the United States. Yet, these controversies (and hoaxes) presume that IQ has some relevance to understanding the president's actual performance as the nation's leader. This assumption is examined by reviewing the empirical research on the intelligence-performance association in political leadership, with a special focus on U.S. presidents. The review starts by discussing at-a-distance assessment techniques, a method that has yielded reliable and valid measures of IQ, Intellectual Brilliance, and Openness to Experience; three correlated even if separable concepts. The discussion then turns to the reliable and valid measurement of presidential performance-or \"greatness\"-via successive surveys of hundreds of experts. These two lines of research then converged on the emergence of a six-predictor equation, in which Intellectual Brilliance plays a major role, to the exclusion of both IQ and Openness. The greatest presidents are those who feature wide interests, and who are artistic, inventive, curious, intelligent, sophisticated, complicated, insightful, wise, and idealistic (but who are far from being either dull or commonplace). These are the personal traits we should look for in the person who occupies the nation's highest office if we seek someone most likely to solve the urgent problems of today and tomorrow.", "Adolescence is the time which is crucial for the overall development of a person both mentally and physically. In this period, along with academic intelligence, emotional intelligence (EI) also plays an equal or strong role in student life.\nThis study was to assess EI, parental bonding, and their association among adolescents in high schools under Sarjapur PHC area.\nThis was a cross-sectional study conducted among high school students under Sarjapur PHC area. The EI was assessed using EI scale which measured self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation, empathy, and social skills. The parental bonding instrument was utilized to determine the parental styles of both the parents and was interpreted in terms of care and protection as neglectful parenting, affectionless control, optimal parenting, and affectionate control.\nA total of 300 adolescents were interviewed. It was seen that most of them had low EI in self-awareness, i.e., 92 (30.7%), motivation 99 (33%), and social skills 101 (33.7%). It was also observed that most of them had high EI in self-regulation, i.e., 98 (32.7%) and moderately high EI in empathy 117 (39%). The study group perceived that 147 (49%) of the fathers and 109 (36.3%) of the mothers had affectionless control.\nAlong with poor parenting, most of the respondents also have low EI in self-awareness, motivation, and social skills which has to be addressed for the future of the country.", "Maternal hypothyroidism and hypothyroxinemia are associated with poor neuropsychological development in children. Previous research is lacking on whether maternal thyroid dysfunction affects sensory and linguistic development in childhood.\nThe Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1986 included all births within a year (9,362 women, 9,479 children) from the two northernmost Finnish provinces. Maternal serum samples (n\u2009=\u20095,791) were obtained in early pregnancy and analyzed for TSH, free T4, and thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPO-Abs). Five thousand three hundred and ninety-one parents evaluated their child's sensory and linguistic development at 7\u2009years old via a questionnaire (excluding children with an intelligence quotient \u226485). The prevalence of sensory and linguistic impairments was compared between mothers with and without thyroid dysfunction.\nThere were no statistically significant differences in the prevalence of sensory or linguistic impairment between children of mothers with and without thyroid dysfunction. Children of hypothyroid and hypothyroxinemic mothers had an increased prevalence of vision impairment compared with those of euthyroid mothers (10.8 and 11.7%, respectively, versus 6.5%), but the difference was not significant. All results remained similar after excluding TPO-Ab-positive mothers and premature children.\nWe did not find an association between maternal thyroid dysfunction during pregnancy and sensory and linguistic development impairment in childhood. A somewhat higher prevalence of vision impairment was seen in children of hypothyroid and hypothyroxinemic mothers, which merits further research.", "Neuromorphic computational systems that emulate biological synapses in the human brain are fundamental in the development of artificial intelligence protocols beyond the standard von Neumann architecture. Such systems require new types of building blocks, such as memristors that access a quasi-continuous and wide range of conductive states, which is still an obstacle for the realization of high-efficiency and large-capacity learning in neuromorphoric simulation. Here, we introduce hydrogen and sodium titanate nanobelts, the intermediate products of hydrothermal synthesis of TiO2 nanobelts, to emulate the synaptic behavior. Devices incorporating a single titanate nanobelt demonstrate robust and reliable synaptic functions, including excitatory postsynaptic current, paired pulse facilitation, short term plasticity, potentiation and depression, as well as learning-forgetting behavior. In particular, the gradual modulation of conductive states in the single nanobelt device can be achieved by a large number of identical pulses. The mechanism for synaptic functionality of the titanate nanobelt device is attributed to the competition between an electric field driven migration of oxygen vacancies and a thermally induced spontaneous diffusion. These results provide insight into the potential use of titanate nanobelts in synaptic applications requiring continuously addressable states coupled with high processing efficiency.", "Research on creativity shows that creative thinking entails both executive (controlled) and associative (spontaneous) processes. Yet standard creativity tasks cannot reliably isolate these two types of cognitive processes, making it difficult to understand the relation between the two and the roles of their corresponding brain networks in creative cognition. In this study we used a behavioral and neuroimaging approach in an effort to establish chain free association (FA) tasks as a relevant method for directly investigating spontaneous associative thinking and its role in creative cognition. We further examined the relation between performance on such tasks and intelligence. Participants completed common creativity tasks and then underwent fMRI scanning while producing FA chains. Instructions to participants that emphasized the spontaneous nature of the task, coupled with proper control conditions that were balanced for difficulty, enabled us to uncover spontaneous (as opposed to controlled) processes. To examine whether behavioral measures that can be derived from FA chains (associative fluency, associative flexibility and semantic remoteness between associations) are indicative of unconstrained spontaneous associative processing and are related to different aspects of verbal creativity and intelligence, scores on these measures were correlated with scores on creativity tasks and on an intelligence task, and with brain activity. We found that: (1) the Default Mode Network (DMN), a network involved in self-generated and internally-directed thought, was more involved in chain FA than in other tasks expected to reflect more controlled forms of internally-directed thought, suggesting that the DMN involvement might be related to the unconstrained spontaneous nature of chain FA. Higher involvement of the left IFG, SFG, MFG under chain FA was also revealed; (2) higher scores on different behavioral measures from FA chains were related to higher activation of the DMN and to reduced activation of the left IFG, a major node in the executive function network; (3) behavioral measures from FA chains were correlated with different aspects of creative performance but not with intelligence. Taken together, these findings lend support to the hypothesis that chain FA involves associative spontaneous thinking. They further suggest that behavioral measures derived from chain FA could indicate patterns of unconstrained associative thinking, related to reduced cognitive control, that are relevant for creative ideation, and might be able to serve as a measure of these patterns.", "The German socio-demographic estimation scale was developed by Jahn et al. (1) to quickly predict premorbid global cognitive functioning in patients. So far, it has been validated in healthy adults and has shown a good correlation with the full and verbal IQ of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) in this group. However, there are no data regarding its use as a bedside test in epilepsy patients.\nForty native German speaking adult patients with refractory epilepsy were included. They completed a neuropsychological assessment, including a nine scale short form of the German version of the WAIS-III and the German socio-demographic estimation scale by Jahn et al. (1) during their presurgical diagnostic stay in our center. We calculated means, correlations, and the rate of concordance (range \u00b15 and \u00b17.5 IQ score points) between these two measures for the whole group, and a subsample of 19 patients with a global cognitive functioning level within 1 SD of the mean (IQ score range 85-115) and who had completed their formal education before epilepsy onset.\nThe German demographic estimation scale by Jahn et al. (1) showed a significant mean overestimation of the global cognitive functioning level of eight points in the epilepsy patient sample compared with the short form WAIS-III score. The accuracy within a range of \u00b15 or \u00b17.5 IQ score points for each patient was similar to that of the healthy controls reported by Jahn et al. (1) in our subsample, but not in our whole sample.\nOur results show that the socio-demographic scale by Jahn et al. (1) is not sufficiently reliable as an estimation tool of global cognitive functioning in epilepsy patients. It can be used to estimate global cognitive functioning in a subset of patients with a normal global cognitive functioning level who have completed their formal education before epilepsy onset, but it does not reliably predict global cognitive functioning in epilepsy patients in general, who often do not fulfill these criteria. It is therefore not a useful tool to be applied in the general neuropsychological presurgical evaluation of epilepsy patients.", "Cognitive reserve (CR), defined as individual differences in the ability to cope with brain damage, seem to be associated to the several psychopathological features in psychiatric patients, such as the functional outcome. This study aims to identify different profiles of CR by combining intelligence quotient (IQ) and premorbid functioning, two measures independently associated to CR in previous works, as well as to explore CR effect on both Theory of Mind (ToM) baseline performance and improvement after socio-cognitive trainings.\nSixty patients with chronic schizophrenia underwent a socio-cognitive rehabilitation. All patients were assessed for psychopathology, neurocognition, and ToM at baseline and post-treatment. CR profiles were explored with K-means cluster analysis, while differences between clusters in both baseline assessments and post-treatment ToM improvement, were analyzed by means of analysis of variance and repeated measures analysis of covariance.\nThe analysis revealed three CR profiles, respectively, characterized by low early premorbid functioning and mild intellectual impairment, average/high early premorbid functioning trend with moderate intellectual impairment and good early premorbid functioning associated to IQ within normal limits. Analyses showed a significant effect of CR on both baseline ToM performance and treatment outcome: patients with higher CR reached significantly better ToM scores.\nThese results underline the clinical relevance of defining CR profiles of patients to customize trainings: subjects with a lower CR may benefit from more intensive programs. A deeper knowledge about CR may considerably increase our understanding of individual differences and thus potentiate treatment outcome.

Moreover, once the amount of data reaches a certain threshold, conventional mining methods (based on spreadsheets or statistical software) become cumbersome or even impossible to apply. Data Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) solutions provide a framework to normalize and integrate heterogeneous data into a local data store. Additionally, the application of Online Analytical Processing (OLAP), a set of Business Intelligence (BI) methodologies and practices for multidimensional data analysis, can be an invaluable tool for its examination and mining. In this article, we describe a solution based on an ETL\u2009+\u2009OLAP tandem used for the on-the-fly analysis of tens of millions of individual medical, meteorological, and air quality observations from 16 provinces in Spain provided by 20 different national and regional entities in a diverse array for file types and formats, with the intention of evaluating the effect of several environmental variables on human health in future studies. Our work shows how a sizable amount of data, spread across a wide range of file formats and structures, and originating from a number of different sources belonging to various business domains, can be integrated in a single system that researchers can use for global data analysis and mining.", "Low-education attainment is associated with worse cognitive performance in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients, and possibly with a lower cognitive reserve and/or increased inflammatory activity. Cognitive reserve refers to the capability of a source of intellectual enrichment in attenuating a negative effect of a disease-related factor; while the inflammatory activity is often related to T2-lesion load (T2-LL) increase.\nTo disentangle the effects of cognitive reserve and an increased T2-LL in MS-patients with low-education levels.\nThe study included 136 MS patients and 65 healthy-controls, divided in low-education (12 years or less of school education without obtaining any technical superior degree) and high-education (more than 12 years of school education with technical or superior degree) groups. An extensive battery of neuropsychological tests was applied examining intelligence quotient and six cognitive domains. Test results were z-scored and subjects with z-scores \u2264 -1.5 in two or more domains were considered cognitively impaired. To test the factors associated with worse cognitive performance, regression models were applied using average cognition as target; education level, Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), T2-LL, disease duration, age of disease onset, age and gender as predictors. We also tested the correlation between T2-LL and cognition in the groups. To investigate the role of education level as a source of intellectual enrichment/cognitive reserve in different stages of MS, we sub-divided the MS patients in three groups according to the disease duration (less than 5 years, between 5 and 10 years and more than 10 years).\nWorse average cognition was associated with low-education level, higher T2-LL and male gender. A higher frequency of cognitively impaired patients was observed in MS patients with low-education level, in all stages of the disease. In patients with a disease duration shorter than five years, there was a lower correlation between worse average cognition and T2-LL in the high-education level group, compared to the patients with low-education level; in MS patients with longer disease duration, we observed a stronger correlation between lesion burden and cognitive impairment in both groups.\nEducation attainment is a source of intellectual enrichment and can enhance the cognitive reserve in MS patients. The protective effect of a high-education level was stronger in patients with less than five years of disease, suggesting a stronger role of cognitive reserve in short-term disease. In long-term disease we observed a greater impact of increased inflammatory activity on cognition.", "Researchers have proposed that solving complex reasoning problems, a key indicator of fluid intelligence, involves the same cognitive processes as solving working memory tasks. This proposal is supported by an overlap of the functional brain activations associated with the two types of tasks and by high correlations between interindividual differences in performance. We replicated these findings in 53 older participants but also showed that solving reasoning and working memory problems benefits from different configurations of the functional connectome and that this dissimilarity increases with a higher difficulty load. Specifically, superior performance in a typical working memory paradigm ( n-back) was associated with upregulation of modularity (increased between-network segregation), whereas performance in the reasoning task was associated with effective downregulation of modularity. We also showed that working memory training promotes task-invariant increases in modularity. Because superior reasoning performance is associated with downregulation of modular dynamics, training may thus have fostered an inefficient way of solving the reasoning tasks. This could help explain why working memory training does little to promote complex reasoning performance. The study concludes that complex reasoning abilities cannot be reduced to working memory and suggests the need to reconsider the feasibility of using working memory training interventions to attempt to achieve effects that transfer to broader cognition.", "Objective: This study evaluated which Sluggish Cognitive Tempo (SCT) factors (i.e., Slow, Sleepy, Daydreamer) are most strongly associated with homework motivation, and whether homework motivation mediates the path between SCT and academic impairment. Method: Participants were 285 middle school students (boys 209) in Grades 6 to 8 (ages 10-15 years) who were comprehensively diagnosed with ADHD. Results: Parent- and self-report of SCT Slow behaviors predicted homework motivation above and beyond symptoms of ADHD, oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), anxiety, depression, and intelligence. The mediation models tested were multi-informant and cross-rater (parent-report of SCT to self-report of motivation to teacher-report of homework problems), and suggest that low motivation may help explain the associations between SCT and functional impairment. Conclusion: SCT and motivation are significantly associated constructs. Clinically, youth with ADHD and comorbid SCT may be more likely to present with low motivation, placing them at risk for academic failure. The manuscript discusses potential clinical implications of these findings.", "Millions of people worldwide are exposed to deadly infectious diseases on a regular basis. Breaking news of the Zika outbreak for instance, made it to the main media titles internationally. Perceiving disease risks motivate people to adapt their behavior toward a safer and more protective lifestyle. Computational science is instrumental in exploring patterns of disease spread emerging from many individual decisions and interactions among agents and their environment by means of agent-based models. Yet, current disease models rarely consider simulating dynamics in risk perception and its impact on the adaptive protective behavior. Social sciences offer insights into individual risk perception and corresponding protective actions, while machine learning\u00a0provides algorithms and methods to capture these learning processes. This article presents an innovative approach to extend agent-based disease models by capturing behavioral aspects of decision-making in a risky context using machine learning\u00a0techniques. We illustrate it with a case of cholera in Kumasi, Ghana, accounting for spatial and social risk factors that affect intelligent behavior and corresponding disease incidents. The results of computational experiments comparing intelligent with zero-intelligent representations of agents in a spatial disease agent-based model are discussed.\nWe present a spatial disease agent-based model (ABM) with agents' behavior grounded in Protection Motivation Theory. Spatial and temporal patterns of disease diffusion among zero-intelligent agents are compared to those produced by a population of intelligent agents. Two Bayesian Networks (BNs) designed and coded using R and are further integrated with the NetLogo-based Cholera ABM. The first is a one-tier BN1 (only risk perception), the second is a two-tier BN2 (risk and coping behavior).\nWe run three experiments (zero-intelligent agents, BN1 intelligence and BN2 intelligence) and report the results per experiment in terms of several macro metrics of interest: an epidemic curve, a risk perception curve, and a distribution of different types of coping strategies over time.\nOur results emphasize the importance of integrating behavioral aspects of decision making under risk into spatial disease ABMs using machine learning algorithms. This is especially relevant when studying cumulative impacts of behavioral changes and possible intervention strategies.", "The article covers the problems of diagnosis and treatment of mental impairment in children with cerebral palsy. Mental disorders in cerebral palsy include cognitive impairment (disorders of perception, memory, attention, motor-visual coordination, intelligence and speech), border disorders (cerebral/asthenic, neurosis-like, psychopathic-like syndromes) and personality disorders (accentuation of character, mental infantilism). Diagnosis of mental disorders in patients with cerebral palsy is a challenging task, due to various combinations of them with physical, speech and sensory disorders, which requires a differentiated approach. Current trends in comprehensive system of rehabilitation, including medical and social, and psychological-pedagogical correction of cognitive, emotional and behavioral disorders, in cerebral palsy are reviewed. Experience of using cortexin, which compensates for cognitive impairment and improves social adaptation, is discussed.\n\u0412 \u0441\u0442\u0430\u0442\u044c\u0435

(TBI) is a major health problem that often requires intensive and long-term rehabilitation.\nThe aim of this study was to determine whether rehabilitative digital gaming facilitates cognitive functioning and general well-being in people with TBI.\nA total of 90 Finnish-speaking adults with TBI (18-65 years) were recruited from an outpatient neuroscience clinic. The participants were randomly allocated to one of the three groups: a rehabilitation gaming group (n=29, intervention), an entertainment gaming group (n=29, active control), or a passive control group (n=32). The gaming groups were instructed to engage in gaming for a minimum of 30 min per day for 8 weeks. Primary and secondary outcomes were measured at three time points: before the intervention, after the intervention, and 3 months following the intervention. The primary outcome was cognitive status measured by processing speed and visuomotor tasks (The Trail Making Test; Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Fourth Edition, WAIS-IV, symbol search, coding, and cancellation tasks). Secondary outcomes were attention and executive functions (Simon task), working memory (WAIS-IV digit span and Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test, PASAT), depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9), self-efficacy (General Self-efficacy Scale), and executive functions (Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function-Adult Version). Feasibility information was assessed (acceptability, measurement instruments filled, dropouts, adherence, usability, satisfaction, and possible future use). Cognitive measurements were conducted in face-to-face interviews by trained psychologists, and questionnaires were self-administered.\nThe effects of rehabilitation gaming did not significantly differ from the effects of entertainment gaming or being in a passive control group. For primary outcomes and PASAT tests, the participants in all three groups showed overall improvement in test scores across the three measurement points. However, depression scores increased significantly between baseline and after 8 weeks and between baseline and after 3 months in the rehabilitative gaming group. No differences were found in patients' self-efficacy between the three measuring points in any of the groups. Participants did use the games (rehabilitation group: 93%, 27/29; entertainment group 100%, 29/29). Games were seen as a usable intervention (rehabilitation group: 70%, 14/29; entertainment group: 83%, 20/29). The rehabilitation group was less satisfied with the gaming intervention (68%, 13/29 vs 83%, 20/29), but they were more willing to use the game after the intervention period (76%, 16/29 vs 63%, 15/29). Total time spent on gaming during the intervention period was low (15.22 hour rehabilitation gaming group, 19.22 hour entertainment gaming group).\nWe did not find differences between the groups in improvement in the outcome measures. The improvements in test performance by all three groups may reflect rehearsal effects. Entertainment gaming had elements that could be considered when rehabilitative games are designed for, implemented in, and assessed in larger clinical trials for persons with TBI.\nClinicalTrials.gov NCT02425527; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02425527 (Archived by WebCite at http://www.webcitation.org/6esKI1uDH).", "Agenesis of the corpus callosum (AgCC), characterized by developmental absence of the corpus callosum, is one of the most common congenital brain malformations. To date, there are limited data on the neuropsychological consequences of AgCC and factors that modulate different outcomes, especially in children. This study aimed to describe general intellectual, academic, executive, social and behavioral functioning in a cohort of school-aged children presenting for clinical services to a hospital and diagnosed with AgCC. The influences of age, social risk and neurological factors were examined.\nTwenty-eight school-aged children (8 to 17 years) diagnosed with AgCC completed tests of general intelligence (IQ) and academic functioning. Executive, social and behavioral functioning in daily life, and social risk, were estimated from parent and teacher rated questionnaires. MRI findings reviewed by a pediatric neurologist confirmed diagnosis and identified brain characteristics. Clinical details including the presence of epilepsy and diagnosed genetic condition were obtained from medical records.\nIn our cohort, ~50% of children experienced general intellectual, academic, executive, social and/or behavioral difficulties and ~20% were functioning at a level comparable to typically developing children. Social risk was important for understanding variability in neuropsychological outcomes. Brain anomalies and complete AgCC were associated with lower mathematics performance and poorer executive functioning.\nThis is the first comprehensive report of general intellectual, academic, executive social and behavioral consequences of AgCC in school-aged children. The findings have important clinical implications, suggesting that support to families and targeted intervention could promote positive neuropsychological functioning in children with AgCC who come to clinical attention.

It is important to assess the progression of college students' cognitive abilities among different college majors and as they move from junior to senior levels. However, dearth of studies have been examined the role of cognitive ability tests as a tool to determine the aptitude of the perspective students. Therefore, this study assessed cognitive abilities of computer science and ART students. [Subjects and Methods] Participants were 130 college students (70 computer and 60 art students) in their first and final years of study at King Saud University. Cognitive ability was assessed using the Test of Nonverbal Intelligence, Third Edition. [Results] The cognitive ability of computer science students were statistically better than that of art students and were shown improvement from junior to senior levels, while the cognitive ability of art students did not. [Conclusion] The cognitive ability of computer science college students was superior compared to those in art, indicating the importance of cognitive ability assessment for high school graduates prior to choosing a college major. Cognitive scales should be included as an aptitude assessment tool for decision-makers and prospective students to determine an appropriate career, which might reduce the rate of university drop out.", "Mounting evidence indicates that worldwide, innovation systems are increasing unsustainable. Equally, concerns about inequities in the science and innovation process, and in access to its benefits, continue. Against a backdrop of growing health, economic and scientific challenges global stakeholders are urgently seeking to spur innovation and maximize the just distribution of benefits for all. Open Science collaboration (OS) - comprising a variety of approaches to increase open, public, and rapid mobilization of scientific knowledge - is seen to be one of the most promising ways forward. Yet, many decision-makers hesitate to construct policy to support the adoption and implementation of OS without access to substantive, clear and reliable evidence. In October 2017, international thought-leaders gathered at an Open Science Leadership Forum in the Washington DC offices of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to share their views on what successful Open Science looks like. Delegates from developed and developing nations, national governments, science agencies and funding bodies, philanthropy, researchers, patient organizations and the biotechnology, pharma and artificial intelligence (AI) industries discussed the outcomes that would rally them to invest in OS, as well as wider issues of policy and implementation. This first of two reports, summarizes delegates' views on what they believe OS will deliver in terms of research, innovation and social impact in the life sciences. Through open and collaborative process over the next months, we will translate these success outcomes into a toolkit of quantitative and qualitative indicators to assess when, where and how open science collaborations best advance research, innovation and social benefit. Ultimately, this work aims to develop and openly share tools to allow stakeholders to evaluate and re-invent their innovation ecosystems, to maximize value for the global public and patients, and address long-standing questions about the mechanics of innovation.", "We aimed to investigate the risk factors of post-coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) atrial fibrillation (AF) in male and female patients without any history of AF, to identify the sex-specific risk factors, and to examine the effect of sex-specific risk factors on the overall population.\nThis retrospective study was conducted using the hospital database with 4,758 patients who underwent CABG surgery. Among them, 2,836 patients with complete data participated in this study. The female patients were divided into two groups as patients who developed new-onset AF after CABG and those who did not. The relationship between the patients' variables and risk factors of post-CABG AF was examined.\nThe overall incidence of post CABG AF was 12.9% (386/2,836). Sex-specific incidence of AF was similar: 3.2% (91/690) and 12.9% (277/2146) in female and male patients, respectively (p\u2009=\u20090.849). Multiple analysis revealed the independent risk factors for male and female patients, respectively: mean age (odds ratio [OR]\u2009=\u20091.057, OR\u2009=\u20091,076), age over 65 years (OR\u2009=\u20092.156, OR\u2009=\u20092.736), the European System For Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation Scores (EuroSCORE) (OR\u2009=\u20091.13, OR\u2009=\u20091.218), COPD (OR\u2009=\u20091.589, OR\u2009=\u20091.789), BUN level (OR\u2009=\u20091.026, OR\u2009=\u20091.019), mean cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) time (OR\u2009=\u20091.007, OR\u2009=\u20091.010), prolonged CPB time (OR\u2009=\u20091.604, OR\u2009=\u20092.309), mean cross-clamp time (OR\u2009=\u20091.009, OR\u2009=\u20091.017), need of inotropic support (OR\u2009=\u20092.249, OR\u2009=\u20092.731), and mean mechanical ventilation time (VT) (OR\u2009=\u20091.026, OR\u2009=\u20091.027).Low left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (OR\u2009=\u20091.419), left ventricular (LV) aneurysm repair (OR\u2009=\u20091.533), carotid artery disease (OR\u2009=\u20091.750), prolonged VT (OR\u2009=\u20091.729), and use of intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) (OR\u2009=\u20092.436) were found to be the risk factors only for male AF patients.Unstable angina (OR\u2009=\u20091.969), right coronary artery (RCA) disease (OR\u2009=\u20092), prolonged cross-clamp time (OR\u2009=\u20092.152), and the number of grafts per operation (OR\u2009=\u20091.298) were found to be the risk factors only for female AF patients.\nThis study suggests that predictors of AF in the overall population may be due to isolated patient groups.

The Argentine Coping Questionnaire, the Argentine Scale for the Perception of Parent Relations, and the comprehension subtest of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children III (WISC III) were used. Results were compared using a multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA).\nSixty children with CH were included; they perceived that their mothers exercised a strict control and that their fathers showed more acceptance. They sought more support and became paralyzed more often in conflicting situations than the 60 children without CH.\nThese findings may be associated with a higher level of dependence.

To foster better understanding of this phenomenon, we present the result of the first-principles study of phase transition in PbS at finite temperature. We employed the particle swarm-intelligence optimization algorithm for the 0 K structure search and first-principles metadynamics simulations to study the phase transition pathway of PbS from the ambient pressure, 0 K Fm-3m structure to the high-pressure Pm-3m phase under experimentally achievable P-T conditions. Significantly, our calculation shows that both streams are achievable under specific P-T conditions. We further uncover new tetragonal and monoclinic structures of PbS with space group P21/c and I41/amd, respectively. We propose the P21/c and I41/amd as a precursor phase to the Pnma and Cmcm phases, respectively. We investigated the stability of the new structures and found them to be dynamically stable at their stability pressure range. Electronic structure calculations reveal that both P21/c and I41/amd phases are semiconducting with direct and indirect bandgap energies of 0.69(5) eV and 0.97(3) eV, respectively. In general, both P21/c and I41/amd phases were found to be energetically competitive with their respective orthorhombic successors.", "This article has been prepared by Amanda Carson of the APHA Small Ruminant Species Expert Group and Richard Irvine of the APHA's Surveillance Intelligence Unit.", "Significant knowledge gaps exist in the functioning of institutional designs and organisational practices in purchasing within free healthcare schemes in low resource countries. The study provides evidence of the governance requirements to scale up strategic purchasing in free healthcare policies in Nigeria and other low-resource settings facing similar approaches.\nThe study was conducted at the Ministry of Health and in two health districts in Enugu State, Nigeria, using a qualitative case study design. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 44 key health system actors (16 policymakers, 16 providers and 12 health facility committee leaders) purposively selected from the Ministry of Health and the two health districts. Data collection and analysis were guided by Siddiqi and colleagues' health system governance framework. Data were analysed using a framework approach.\nThe key findings show that supportive governance practices in purchasing included systems to verify questionable provider claims, pay providers directly for services, compel providers to procure drugs centrally and track transfer of funds to providers. However, strategic vision was undermined by institutional conflicts, absence of purchaser-provider split and lack of selective contracting of providers. Benefit design was not based on stakeholder involvement. Rule of law was limited by delays in provider payment. Benefits and obligations to users were not transparent. The criteria and procedure for resource allocation were unclear. Some target beneficiaries seemed excluded from the scheme. Effectiveness and efficiency was constrained by poor adherence to purchasing rules. Accountability of purchasers and providers to users was weak. Intelligence and information is constrained by paper-based system. Rationing of free services by providers and users' non-adherence to primary gate-keeping role hindered ethics.\nWeak governance of purchasing function limits potential of FMCHP to contribute towards universal health coverage. Appropriate governance model for strengthening strategic purchasing in the FMCHP and possibly free healthcare interventions in other low-resource countries must pay attention to the creation of an autonomous purchasing agency, clear framework for selective contracting, stakeholder involvement, transparent benefit design, need-based resource allocation, efficient provider payment methods, stronger roles for citizens, enforcement of gatekeeping rules and use of data for decision-making.", "To use magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and clinical patient data to create an artificial intelligence (AI) framework for the prediction of therapeutic outcomes of transarterial chemoembolization by applying machine learning (ML) techniques.\nThis study included 36 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treated with transarterial chemoembolization. The cohort (age 62 \u00b1 8.9 years; 31 men; 13 white; 24 Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0, 10 status 1, 2 status 2; 31 Child-Pugh stage A, 4 stage B, 1 stage C; 1 Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage 0, 12 stage A, 10 stage B, 13 stage C; tumor size 5.2 \u00b1 3.0 cm; number of tumors 2.6 \u00b1 1.1; and 30 conventional transarterial chemoembolization, 6 with drug-eluting embolic agents). MR imaging was obtained before and 1 month after transarterial chemoembolization. Image-based tumor response to transarterial chemoembolization was assessed with the use of the 3D quantitative European Association for the Study of the Liver (qEASL) criterion. Clinical information, baseline imaging, and therapeutic features were used to train logistic regression (LR) and random forest (RF) models to predict patients as treatment responders or nonresponders under the qEASL response criterion. The performance of each model was validated using leave-one-out cross-validation.\nBoth LR and RF models predicted transarterial chemoembolization treatment response with an overall accuracy of 78% (sensitivity 62.5%, specificity 82.1%, positive predictive value 50.0%, negative predictive value 88.5%). The strongest predictors of treatment response included a clinical variable (presence of cirrhosis) and an imaging variable (relative tumor signal intensity >27.0).\nTransarterial chemoembolization outcomes in patients with HCC may be predicted before procedures by combining clinical patient data and baseline MR imaging with the use of AI and ML techniques.", "In genetics, heterosis refers to the phenomenon that cross-breeding within species leads to offspring that are genetically fitter than their parents and exhibit improved phenotypic characteristics. Based on the theory of heterosis and existing genetic evidence, offspring of \"hybrid\" marriages (spouses originating from different states/provinces/countries/areas), though relatively rare due to physical boundaries, may exhibit greater genetic fitness in terms of intelligence, height, or physical attractiveness (the \"distance-performance\" hypothesis). This study explores whether heterosis is a contributing factor to offspring's educational attainment in China by applying a high-dimensional fixed effects (HDFE) modelling framework to the unique 0.1% micro-sample of the 2000 Chinese Population Census data. Concerning potential endogeneity of hybrid marriages, we conduct a series of robustness checks. Reassuringly, the estimated heterosis effect remains significantly positive across various measurements, after controlling for parental educational attainments/height, environmental influences, and over a thousand region and region-by-year fixed effects. The effects in male and higher-educated offspring are found to be stronger. Results are replicated when analyzing body height using data from the China Health and Nutrition Survey. Although endogeneity of \"hybrid marriages\" may not be completely ruled out, the current study sheds light on the potentially beneficial effects of interprovincial migration on population-level human capital accumulation, and we hope that this paper can intrigue future studies that further address endogeneity. The implied heterosis effect could, therefore, be profound for Homo sapiens as a species from an evolutionary point of view. An additional important implication is that the overall genetic influences of parents on offspring's performance may be further decomposed into a conventional heredity effect and a heterosis effect that has been neglected previously.", "The concentrations of measure phenomena were discovered as the mathematical background to statistical mechanics at the end of the nineteenth/beginning of the twentieth century and have been explored in mathematics ever since. At the beginning of the twenty-first century, it became clear that the proper utilization of these phenomena in machine learning might transform the curse of dimensionality into the blessing of dimensionality This paper summarizes recently discovered phenomena of measure concentration which drastically simplify some machine learning problems in high dimension, and allow us to correct legacy artificial intelligence systems. The classical concentration of measure theorems state that i.i.d. random points are concentrated in a thin layer near a surface (a sphere or equators of a sphere, an average or median-level set of energy or another Lipschitz function, etc.). The new stochastic separation theorems describe the thin structure of these thin layers: the random points are not only concentrated in a thin layer but are all linearly separable from the rest of the set, even for exponentially large random sets. The linear functionals for separation of points can be selected in the form of the linear Fisher's discriminant. All artificial intelligence systems make errors. Non-destructive correction requires separation of the situations (samples) with errors from the samples corresponding to correct behaviour by a simple and robust classifier. The stochastic separation theorems provide us with such classifiers and determine a non-iterative (one-shot) procedure for their construction.This article is part of the theme issue 'Hilbert's sixth problem'.", "BackgroundBeing born with very low birth weight (<1500\u2009g) is associated with poorer neurocognition later in life. The aim of this study was to explore neurodevelopmental functions in those born with marginally LBW (2000-2500\u2009g).MethodsThis was originally a randomized controlled trial investigating the effects of early iron supplementation in 285 marginally LBW children. Herein, we explored the combined marginally LBW group and compared their results to 95 normal birth weight (NBW; 2501-4500\u2009g) controls in an observational design. At 7 years, a pediatric psychologist tested the children using Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC IV), Beery-Buktenica developmental test of Visual-Motor Integration (Beery VMI), and Test of Everyday Attention for Children (TEA-Ch).ResultsThe marginally LBW children had lower verbal comprehension intelligence quotient (IQ) (104 vs. 107, P=0.004), lower VMI scores (96.5 vs. 100, P=0.028), and lower total mean TEA-Ch scores (8.5 vs. 9.7, P=0.006), compared to controls. Also, the marginally LBW children group had a higher proportion of children below -1\u2009SD for VMI and TEA-Ch.ConclusionsMarginally LBW children had lower verbal comprehension IQ, lower visual-motor integration, and lower attention performance than NBW children, suggesting an increased risk of cognitive difficulties in early school age.", "Aging is characterized by a cognitive decline of fluid abilities and is also associated with electrophysiological changes. The vascular hypothesis proposes that brain is sensitive to vascular dysfunction which may accelerate age-related brain modifications and thus explain age-related neurocognitive decline. To test this hypothesis, cognitive performance was measured in 39 healthy participants from 20 to 80\u202fyears, using tests assessing inhibition, fluid intelligence, attention and crystallized abilities. Brain functioning associated with attentional abilities was assessed by measuring the P3b ERP component elicited through an auditory oddball paradigm. To assess vascular health, we used an innovative measure of the pulsatility of deep brain tissue, due to variations in cerebral blood flow over the cardiac cycle. Results showed (1) a classical effect of age on fluid neurocognitive measures (inhibition, fluid intelligence, magnitude and latency of the P3b) but not on crystallized measures, (2) that brain pulsatility decreases with advancing age, (3) that brain pulsatility is positively correlated with fluid neurocognitive measures and (4) that brain pulsatility strongly mediated the age-related variance in cognitive performance and the magnitude of the P3b component. The mediating role of the brain pulsatility in age-related effect on neurocognitive measures supports the vascular hypothesis of cognitive aging.", "Human heart electrophysiology is complex biological phenomenon, which is indirectly assessed by the measured ECG signal. ECG trace is further analyzed to derive interpretable surrogates including QT interval, QRS complex, PR interval, and T wave morphology. QT interval and its modification are the most commonly used surrogates of the drug triggered arrhythmia, but it is known that the QT interval itself is determined by other nondrug related parameters, physiological and pathological. In the current study, we used the computational intelligence algorithms to analyze correlations between various simulated physiological parameters and QT interval. Terfenadine given concomitantly with 8 enzymatic inhibitors was used as an example. The equation developed with the use of genetic programming technique leads to general reasoning about the changes in the prolonged QT. For small changes of the QT interval, the drug-related IKr and ICa currents inhibition potentials have major impact. The physiological parameters such as body surface area, potassium, sodium, and calcium ions concentrations are negligible. The influence of the physiological variables increases gradually with the more pronounced changes in QT. As the significant QT prolongation is associated with the drugs triggered arrhythmia risk, analysis of the role of physiological parameters influencing ECG seems to be advisable.", "The use of statistical models for analyzing traffic safety (crash) data has been well-established. However, time series techniques have traditionally been underrepresented in the corresponding literature, due to challenges in data collection, along with a limited knowledge of proper methodology. In recent years, new types of high-resolution traffic safety data, especially in measuring driver behavior, have made time series modeling techniques an increasingly salient topic of study. Yet there remains a dearth of information to guide analysts in their use. This paper provides an overview of the state of the art in using time series models in traffic safety research, and discusses some of the fundamental techniques and considerations in classic time series modeling. It also presents ongoing and future opportunities for expanding the use of time series models, and explores newer modeling techniques, including computational intelligence models, which hold promise in effectively handling ever-larger data sets. The information contained herein is meant to guide safety researchers in understanding this broad area of transportation data analysis, and provide a framework for understanding safety trends that can influence policy-making.", "New technologies can profoundly change the way we understand psychiatric pathologies and addictive disorders. New concepts are emerging with the development of more accurate means of collecting live data, computerized questionnaires, and the use of passive data. Digital phenotyping, a paradigmatic example, refers to the use of computerized measurement tools to capture the characteristics of different psychiatric disorders. Similarly, machine learning-a form of artificial intelligence-can improve the classification of patients based on patterns that clinicians have not always considered in the past. Remote or automated interventions (web-based or smartphone-based apps), as well as virtual reality and neurofeedback, are already available or under development.\nThese recent changes have the potential to disrupt practices, as well as practitioners' beliefs, ethics and representations, and may even call into question their professional culture. However, the impact of new technologies on health professionals' practice in addictive disorder care has yet to be determined. In the present paper, we therefore present an overview of new technology in the field of addiction medicine.\nUsing the keywords [e-health], [m-health], [computer], [mobile], [smartphone], [wearable], [digital], [machine learning], [ecological momentary assessment], [biofeedback] and [virtual reality], we searched the PubMed database for the most representative articles in the field of assessment and interventions in substance use disorders.\nWe screened 595 abstracts and analyzed 92 articles, dividing them into seven categories: e-health program and web-based interventions, machine learning, computerized adaptive testing, wearable devices and digital phenotyping, ecological momentary assessment, biofeedback, and virtual reality.\nThis overview shows that new technologies can improve assessment and interventions in the field of addictive disorders. The precise role of connected devices, artificial intelligence and remote monitoring remains to be defined. If they are to be used effectively, these tools must be explained and adapted to the different profiles of physicians and patients. The involvement of patients, caregivers and other health professionals is essential to their design and assessment.", "Background: Research on the effects of music education on cognitive abilities has generated increasing interest across the scientific community. Nonetheless, longitudinal studies investigating the effects of structured music education on cognitive sub-functions are still rare. Prime candidates for investigating a relationship between academic achievement and music education appear to be executive functions such as planning, working memory, and inhibition. Methods: One hundred and forty-seven primary school children, Mage = 6.4 years, SD = 0.65 were followed for 2.5 years. Participants were randomized into four groups: two music intervention groups, one active visual arts group, and a no arts control group. Neuropsychological tests assessed verbal intelligence and executive functions. Additionally, a national pupil monitor provided data on academic performance. Results: Children in the visual arts group perform better on visuospatial memory tasks as compared to the three other conditions. However, the test scores on inhibition, planning and verbal intelligence increased significantly in the two music groups over time as compared to the visual art and no arts controls. Mediation analysis with executive functions and verbal IQ as mediator for academic performance have shown a possible far transfer effect from executive sub-function to academic performance scores. Discussion: The present results indicate a positive influence of long-term music education on cognitive abilities such as inhibition and planning. Of note, following a two-and-a-half year long visual arts program significantly improves scores on a visuospatial memory task. All results combined, this study supports a far transfer effect from music education to academic achievement mediated by executive sub-functions.", "With the advent of electronic medical records (EMRs) fueling the rise of big data, the use of predictive analytics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence are touted as transformational tools to improve clinical care. While major investments are being made in using big data to transform health care delivery, little effort has been directed toward exploiting big data to improve graduate medical education (GME). Because our current system relies on faculty observations of competence, it is not unreasonable to ask whether big data in the form of clinical EMRs and other novel data sources can answer questions of importance in GME such as when is a resident ready for independent practice.The timing is ripe for such a transformation. A recent National Academy of Medicine report called for reforms to how GME is delivered and financed. While many agree on the need to ensure that GME meets our nation's health needs, there is little consensus on how to measure the performance of GME in meeting this goal. During a recent workshop at the National Academy of Medicine on GME outcomes and metrics in October 2017, a key theme emerged: Big data holds great promise to inform GME performance at individual, institutional, and national levels. In this Invited Commentary, several examples are presented, such as using big data to inform clinical experience and provide clinically meaningful data to trainees, and using novel data sources, including ambient data, to better measure the quality of GME training.", "Multiple personal and work-related factors influence medical trainees' career decision-making. The relative value of these diverse factors is under-researched, yet this intelligence is crucially important for informing medical workforce planning and retention and recruitment policies. Our aim was to investigate the relative value of UK doctors' preferences for different training post characteristics during the time period when they either apply for specialty or core training or take time out.\nWe developed a discrete choice experiment (DCE) specifically for this population. The DCE was distributed to all Foundation Programme Year 2 (F2) doctors across Scotland as part of the National Career Destination Survey in June 2016. The main outcome measure was the monetary value of training post characteristics, based on willingness to forgo additional potential income and willingness to accept extra income for a change in each job characteristic calculated from regression coefficients.\n677/798\u2009F2 doctors provided usable DCE responses. Location was the most influential characteristic of a training position, followed closely by supportive culture and then working conditions. F2 doctors would need to be compensated by an additional 45.75% above potential earnings to move from a post in a desirable location to one in an undesirable location. Doctors who applied for a training post placed less value on supportive culture and excellent working conditions than those who did not apply. Male F2s valued location and a supportive culture less than female F2s.\nThis is the first study focusing on the career decision-making of UK doctors at a critical careers decision-making point. Both location and specific job-related attributes are highly valued by F2 doctors when deciding their future. This intelligence can inform workforce policy to focus their efforts in terms of making training posts attractive to this group of doctors to enhance recruitment and retention.", "The goal of our work is inspired by the task of associating segments of text to their real authors. In this work, we focus on analyzing the way humans judge different writing styles. This analysis can help to better understand this process and to thus simulate/ mimic such behavior accordingly. Unlike the majority of the work done in this field (i.e. authorship attribution, plagiarism detection, etc.) which uses content features, we focus only on the stylometric, i.e. content-agnostic, characteristics of authors. Therefore, we conducted two pilot studies to determine, if humans can identify authorship among documents with high content similarity. The first was a quantitative experiment involving crowd-sourcing, while the second was a qualitative one executed by the authors of this paper. Both studies confirmed that this task is quite challenging. To gain a better understanding of how humans tackle such a problem, we conducted an exploratory data analysis on the results of the studies. In the first experiment, we compared the decisions against content features and stylometric features. While in the second, the evaluators described the process and the features on which their judgment was based. The findings of our detailed analysis could (1) help to improve algorithms such as automatic authorship attribution as well as plagiarism detection, (2) assist forensic experts or linguists to create profiles of writers, (3) support intelligence applications to analyze aggressive and threatening messages and (4) help editor conformity by adhering to, for instance, journal specific writing style.", "Use of DNA in forensic science will be significantly influenced by new technology in coming years. Massively parallel sequencing and forensic genomics will hasten the broadening of forensic DNA analysis beyond short tandem repeats for identity towards a wider array of genetic markers, in applications as diverse as predictive phenotyping, ancestry assignment, and full mitochondrial genome analysis. With these new applications come a range of legal and policy implications, as forensic science touches on areas as diverse as 'big data', privacy and protected health information. Although these applications have the potential to make a more immediate and decisive forensic intelligence contribution to criminal investigations, they raise policy issues that will require detailed consideration if this potential is to be realised. The purpose of this paper is to identify the scope of the issues that will confront forensic and user communities.", "The objective of this project was to develop a computer vision system (CVS) for objective measurement of pork loin under industry speed requirement. Color images of pork loin samples were acquired using a CVS. Subjective color and marbling scores were determined according to the National Pork Board standards by a trained evaluator. Instrument color measurement and crude fat percentage were used as control measurements. Image features (18 color features; 1 marbling feature; 88 texture features) were extracted from whole pork loin color images. Artificial intelligence prediction model (support vector machine) was established for pork color and marbling quality grades. The results showed that CVS with support vector machine modeling reached the highest prediction accuracy of 92.5% for measured pork color score and 75.0% for measured pork marbling score. This research shows that the proposed artificial intelligence prediction model with CVS can provide an effective tool for predicting color and marbling in the pork industry at online speeds.", "Multimedia-enhanced radiology report (MERR) development is defined and described from an informatics perspective, in which the MERR is seen as a superior information-communicating entity. Recent technical advances, such as the hyperlinking of report text directly to annotated images, improve MERR information content and accessibility compared with text-only reports. The MERR is analyzed by its components, which include hypertext, tables, graphs, embedded images, and their interconnections. The authors highlight the advantages of each component for improving the radiologist's communication of report content information and the user's ability to extract information. Requirements for MERR implementation (eg, integration of picture archiving and communication systems, radiology information systems, and electronic medical record systems) and the authors' initial experiences and challenges in MERR implementation at the National Institutes of Health are reviewed. The transition to MERRs has provided advantages over use of traditional text-only radiology reports because of the capacity to include hyperlinked report text that directs clinicians to image annotations, images, tables, and graphs. A framework is provided for thinking about the MERR from the user's perspective. Additional applications of emerging technologies (eg, artificial intelligence and machine learning) are described in the crafting of what the authors believe is the radiology report of the future. \u00a9RSNA, 2018.", "Developing efficient Artificial Intelligence (AI)-enabled systems to substitute the human role in non-destructive testing is an emerging topic of considerable interest. In this study, we propose a novel hammering response analysis system using online machine learning, which aims at achieving near-human performance in assessment of concrete structures. Current computerized hammer sounding systems commonly employ lab-scale data to validate the models. In practice, however, the response signal patterns can be far more complicated due to varying geometric shapes and materials of structures. To deal with a large variety of unseen data, we propose a sequential treatment for response characterization. More specifically, the proposed system can adaptively update itself to approach human performance in hammering sounding data interpretation. To this end, a two-stage framework has been introduced, including feature extraction and the model updating scheme. Various state-of-the-art online learning algorithms have been reviewed and evaluated for the task. To conduct experimental validation, we collected 10,940 response instances from multiple inspection sites; each sample was annotated by human experts with healthy/defective condition labels. The results demonstrated that the proposed scheme achieved favorable assessment accuracy with high efficiency and low computation load.", "International activities to respond to the Ebola crisis in West Africa were mainly developed and focussed around the biomedical paradigm of Western health systems. This approach was often insensitive to societal perception, attitude, and behavioural determinants and clashed with community-based health traditions, narratives, and roles, e.g., of community health workers. In this peer-led capacity-building initiative, these deficiencies were identified and analysed. Innovative, more locally focussed, community-based solutions were articulated. The new approaches described put local people at the centre of all preparedness, response, and recovery strategies. This paradigm shift reframed the role of communities from victims to active managers of their response and reacknowledged the strength of community-based One Health. We conclude that strategies should aim at empowering, not just engaging, communities. Communities can improve short-term crisis management and build longer-term resilience and capacities that are much needed in the current global health climate.\nThe Ebola outbreak in West Africa, 2014-2016, was unprecedented in scale, extent, and duration. The international community was slow to step up its assistance in this global public health emergency and then faltered when its infection control management approaches clashed with West African realities [1]. Outbreak response evaluations have identified the need to better integrate social science intelligence [2], better collaborate with communities [3,4], more effectively draw on the strength of community health workers [5], and critically question the paradigm of Western health systems, which focus on imposing 'evidence-based' solutions that lack external validity in affected communities; i.e., they too often recommend actions that are inconsistent with, ignore, or violate traditional behaviours [6]. While there appears to be a consensus now on what needs to be done, how to achieve these goals remains a challenge.", "Based on modern theories of signal evolution and animal communication, the behavioral ecology view of facial displays (BECV) reconceives our 'facial expressions of emotion' as social tools that serve as lead signs to contingent action in social negotiation. BECV offers an externalist, functionalist view of facial displays that is not bound to Western conceptions about either expressions or emotions. It easily accommodates recent findings of diversity in facial displays, their public context-dependency, and the curious but common occurrence of solitary facial behavior. Finally, BECV restores continuity of human facial behavior research with modern functional accounts of non-human communication, and provides a non-mentalistic account of facial displays well-suited to new developments in artificial intelligence and social robotics.", "The appearance of positive adjustment is a theoretically relevant element of psychopathy, and is valuable for demonstrating its incremental validity over a broader antisocial orientation. We examined associations between psychopathic-like features and two measures of adaptive functioning: psychometric intelligence and (immunity to) internalizing problems. Ratings of psychopathy and behavioral problems were obtained in a community sample of children (N=1210). A bifactor model was fit to the psychopathic personality items to capture the underlying variance common to all traits (i.e., general factor) and to isolate a unique cluster of interpersonal traits. We hypothesized that the general psychopathy factor and specific interpersonal factor would exhibit opposing patterns of associations with external criteria. As expected, the general psychopathy factor was associated with greater anxiety/depression and lower cognitive ability. Contrary to hypothesis, the interpersonal factor was not associated with adaptive functioning (i.e., reduced internal distress or superior cognitive ability), although the predicted relations emerged after controlling for antisocial behavior. Hence, in a large representative sample of children, there is limited support for the premise that psychopathic traits are associated with positive adjustment and enhanced intelligence. Implications regarding the construct validity of psychopathy are discussed, including the role of heterogeneity in sample characteristics and instrument.", "Transplantation is considered as one of the methods for the treatment of autoimmune diseases. There are different sorts of transplantation which improved the situation for the cure of different kinds of autoimmune diseases. Cord blood transplantation is favored over other transplant techniques. The propelled treatments incorporate interferon administrative elements and mesenchymal stromal cells for the management of immune system issue particularly in the treatment of rheumatoid joint inflammation. According to the studies conducted, it was proven that cord blood/UC mesenchymal cells along with DMARDs, without consistent organization expanded the level of administrative regulatory T-cells of the peripheral blood which might be a protected and huge technique for the treatment of patients experiencing rheumatoid joint inflammation. This review article focusses on different organ transplantation and alternative methods to treat autoimmune condition like rheumatoid arthritis. Using 3D printing and artificial intelligence are some of the recent trends that may be used for the management of autoimmune diseases.", "The present study tested the association between both mothers' and offspring's intelligence and offspring's body mass index (BMI) in youth.\nParticipants were members of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 (NLSY-79) Children and Young Adults cohort (n\u2009=\u200911,512) and their biological mothers who were members of the NLSY-79 (n\u2009=\u20094932). Offspring's IQ was measured with the Peabody Individual Achievement Test (PIAT). Mothers' IQ was measured with the Armed Forces Qualification Test (AFQT). A series of regression analyses tested the association between IQ and offspring's BMI by age group, while adjusting for pre-pregnancy BMI and family SES. The analyses were stratified by sex and ethnicity (non-Black and non-Hispanic, Black, and Hispanic).\nThe following associations were observed in the fully adjusted analyses. For the non-Blacks and non-Hispanics, a SD increment in mothers' IQ was negatively associated with daughters' BMI across all age-groups, ranging from \u03b2\u2009=\u2009-0.12 (95% CI -0.22 to -0.02, p\u2009=\u20090.021) in late childhood, to \u03b2\u2009=\u2009-0.17 (95% C.I. -0.27 to -0.07, p\u2009=\u20090001), in early adolescence and a SD increment in boys' IQ was positively associated with their BMI in early adolescence \u03b2\u2009=\u20090.09 (95% CI 0.01-0.18, p\u2009=\u20090.031). For Blacks, there was a non-linear relationship between mothers' IQ and daughters' BMI across childhood and between girls' IQ and BMI across adolescence. There was a positive association between mothers' IQ and sons' BMI in early adolescence (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.17, 95% CI 0.02-0.32, p\u2009=\u20090.030). For Hispanic boys, there was a positive IQ-BMI association in late childhood (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.19, 95% CI 0.05-0.33, p\u2009=\u20090.008) and early adolescence (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.17, 95% CI 0.04-0.31, p\u2009=\u20090.014).\nMothers' IQ and offspring's IQ were associated with offspring's BMI. The relationships varied in direction and strength across ethnicity, age group and sex. Obesity interventions may benefit from acknowledging the heterogeneous influence that intelligence has on childhood BMI.", "Historically, research investigating neural correlates of mentalizing deficits in schizophrenia has focused on patients who have been ill for several years with lengthy exposure to medication. Little is known about the neural and behavioral presentations of theory-of-mind deficits in schizophrenia, shortly after the first episode of psychosis.\nWe investigated social cognition in 17 recently diagnosed first-episode schizophrenia (FES) patients with little or no exposure to antipsychotic medication and 1:1 matched healthy controls. We recorded behavioral and neural responses to the Animated Triangles Task (ATT), which is a nonverbal validated mentalizing task that measures the ascription of intentionality to the movements of objects.\nFES patients under-interpreted social cues and over-interpreted nonsocial cues. These effects were influenced by current intelligence (IQ). Control group and FES neural responses replicated earlier findings in healthy adults. However, a region of anterior medial prefrontal cortex (amPFC) of FES patients showed a different response pattern to that of controls. Unlike healthy controls, patients increased activity in this social cognition region while studying \"random\" movements of shapes, as compared to the study of movements normally interpreted as \"intentional\".\nMentalizing deficits in FES consists of hypo- and hypermentalizing. The neural pattern of FES patients is consistent with deficits in the ability to switch off mentalizing processes in potentially social contexts, instead increasing them when intentionality is not forthcoming. Overall, results demonstrate complexities of theory of mind deficits in schizophrenia that should be considered when offering social cognitive training programs.", "In recent times Italy has been experiencing massive migration flows, therefore the attention on the issue of crimes committed by foreigners is increasing. But within trials, in the evaluation of criminal liability of foreigners, how do experts deal with them? Do the performed evaluations take cultural diversity into account? The present study took origin from these questions and examined a total of 86 reports by experts on criminal liability of foreign persons (16 females and 70 males). Examinees have been declared indictable in 31 cases (36%), totally mentally ill in 40 cases (45%) and with diminished liability in 15 cases (17%); when liability was excluded, examinees were diagnosed in 11 cases with mood disorders, in 23 cases with personality disorders, in 4 cases with adaptation disorders and post-traumatic stress disorder and in 10 cases with different diagnoses (in some cases more than one diagnosis was present). None of the reports used the section of the DSM concerning \"cultural framing\". Tests were used in 48 surveys (56% of cases), with more tests for each examinee, for a total of 39 Rorschach, 14 Raven test, 8 Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory - MMPI - 4 Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale - WAIS - level test, 8 Thematic Apperception test. When subjects were diagnosed with mental disorder and with diminished liability, 42 (79%) were also socially dangerous. Results highlight the importance of the relationship between the expert and the foreigner. Many factors ought to be critically considered by experts dealing with foreigners, like cultural awareness, knowledge of verbal communication, critical consideration of meanings and diagnosis, knowledge of the foreigners' personal story, presence of tests with inexact information and cultural fallacy.", "Problem solving and innovation are key components of intelligence. We compare wild-caught individuals from two species that are close relatives of Darwin's finches, the innovative Loxigilla barbadensis, and its most closely related species in Barbados, the conservative Tiaris bicolor. We found an all-or-none difference in the problem-solving capacity of the two species. Brain RNA sequencing analyses revealed interspecific differences in genes related to neuronal and synaptic plasticity in the intrapallial neural populations (mesopallium and nidopallium), especially in the nidopallium caudolaterale, a structure functionally analogous to the mammalian prefrontal cortex. At a finer scale, we discovered robust differences in glutamate receptor expression between the species. In particular, the GRIN2B/GRIN2A ratio, known to correlate with synaptic plasticity, was higher in the innovative L. barbadensis. These findings suggest that divergence in avian intelligence is associated with similar neuronal mechanisms to that of mammals, including humans.", "Working memory has been shown to be strongly related to fluid intelligence; however, our goal is to shed further light on the process of information compression in working memory as a determining factor of fluid intelligence. Our main hypothesis was that compression in working memory is an excellent indicator for studying the relationship between working-memory capacity and fluid intelligence because both depend on the optimization of storage capacity. Compressibility of memoranda was estimated using an algorithmic complexity metric. The results showed that compressibility can be used to predict working-memory performance and that fluid intelligence is well predicted by the ability to compress information. We conclude that the ability to compress information in working memory is the reason why both manipulation and retention of information are linked to intelligence. This result offers a new concept of intelligence based on the idea that compression and intelligence are equivalent problems.", "Gestational inflammation may contribute to brain abnormalities associated with childhood neuropsychiatric disorders. Limited knowledge exists regarding the associations of maternal cytokine levels during pregnancy with offspring neurocognitive development. We assayed the concentrations of five cytokines (interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1\u03b2, IL-8, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1), and IL-10) up to four times in the 2nd and 3rd trimesters of pregnancy using stored prenatal sera from 1366 participants in the New England Family Study (enrollment 1959-1966). Intelligence (IQ), academic achievement, and neuropsychological functioning of singleton offspring were assessed at age 7 years using standardized tests. We used linear mixed models with random effects to estimate the cumulative exposure to each cytokine during 2nd and 3rd trimesters, and then related cumulative cytokine exposure to a wide range of offspring neurocognitive outcomes. We found that children of women with higher levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokine, TNF-\u03b1, in the 2nd and 3rd trimesters had lower IQ (B\u2009=\u2009-2.51, 99% CI: -4.84,-0.18), higher problem scores in visual-motor maturity (B\u2009=\u20090.12, 99% CI: 0.001,0.24), and lower Draw-a-Person test scores (B\u2009=\u2009-1.28, 99% CI: -2.49,-0.07). Higher gestational levels of IL-8, another pro-inflammatory molecule, were associated with better Draw-a-Person test scores and tactile finger recognition scores. Other cytokines were not associated with our outcome of interest. The opposing directions of associations observed between TNF-\u03b1 and IL-8 with childhood outcomes suggest pleiotropic effects of gestational inflammation across the domains of neurocognitive functioning. Although the path to psychopathological disturbances in children is no doubt multifactorial, our findings point to a potential role for immune processes in the neurocognitive development of children.", "Perceived stress and burnout are by-products of powerless responsibility imposed on resident doctors. Emotional intelligence (EI) works as an adapting and coping tool.\nThe objective of this study is to find out the role of work-related perceived stress on burnout and influence of EI on it.\nA descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted from February to April 2016 among 63 resident doctors of different departments of Bankura Sammilani Medical College and Hospital. Data were collected through a self-administered questionnaire for background characteristics and work-related variables. Cohen perceived stress scale, Trait EI, and Shirom-Melamed burnout questionnaire were applied for measuring perceived stress, EI, and burnout, respectively. Statistical analysis was done with of SPSS version 22.0, and for mediation analysis, Andrew F. Hyne's SPSS macro was adopted. Nonparametric bootstrapping was done assuming small sample.\nOut of complete responses, 67%, 22.9%, and 9.8% were from clinical, paraclinical, and preclinical specialties, respectively. Burnout had a significant positive correlation with perceived stress and in negative correlation with EI-well-being and positive correlation with EI-self-control and sociability. Physical fatigue factor of burnout had a significant positive correlation with EI-emotionality. Perceived stress had a negative correlation with EI-well-being. On mediation analysis, assuming EI as a mediator, total, direct, and indirect effects of perceived stress on burnout were significant (<0.05). Mediation was proved to act with percent mediation of 0.07.\nThere was definite mitigating effect of EI on burnout by perceived stress among resident doctors. This necessitates more attention by decision-makers toward this burning problem for the sake of care of caregivers.", "This study investigated whether individuals with Williams syndrome (WS) can attain a functional level of basic reading skills. The Study also investigated broader cognitive factors associated with reading ability in individuals with WS. Thirty individuals with WS participated in this study (mean chronological age 21\u00a0years and mean mental age 7\u00a0years 7\u00a0months). The results supported our hypotheses that: firstly, reading abilities would be heterogeneous in WS; secondly, at least some WS individuals are capable of achieving a functional basic reading level; and thirdly, on average, WS individuals would find reading of nonwords more difficult than reading of regular and irregular words. Moreover, higher reading ability was found to be associated with increased outcomes in adaptive functioning, in particular, Written and Expressive Communication skills and Community Living skills, highlighting the potential benefits of developing reading abilities in WS. Although Intelligence Quotient (IQ) was related to overall basic reading ability generally, it was not found to be a determining factor in reading subtypes. Several cognitive skills known to be related to reading ability in typically developing individuals were found to be associated with reading performance and reading subtypes. Implications for appropriate reading instruction are discussed.", "Radiology practice will be altered by the coming of artificial intelligence, and the process of learning in radiology will be similarly affected. In the short term, radiologists will need to understand the first wave of artificially intelligent tools, how they can help them improve their practice, and be able to effectively supervise their use. Radiology training programs will need to develop curricula to help trainees acquire the knowledge to carry out this new supervisory duty of radiologists. In the longer term, artificially intelligent software assistants could have a transformative effect on the training of residents and fellows, and offer new opportunities to bring learning into the ongoing practice of attending radiologists.", "NASA's space robots will need the repair capabilities and intelligence of R2D2 and BB-8 but may resemble C3PO and K-2SO.", "Variance in IQ is associated with a wide range of health outcomes, and 1% of the population are affected by intellectual disability. Despite a century of research, the fundamental neural underpinnings of intelligence remain unclear. We integrate results from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of intelligence with brain tissue and single cell gene expression data to identify tissues and cell types associated with intelligence. GWAS data for IQ (N\u2009=\u200978,308) were meta-analyzed with a study comparing 1247 individuals with mean IQ ~170 to 8185 controls. Genes associated with intelligence implicate pyramidal neurons of the somatosensory cortex and CA1 region of the hippocampus, and midbrain embryonic GABAergic neurons. Tissue-specific analyses find the most significant enrichment for frontal cortex brain expressed genes. These results suggest specific neuronal cell types and genes may be involved in intelligence and provide new hypotheses for neuroscience experiments using model systems.", "Current dialysis devices are not able to react when unexpected changes occur during dialysis treatment or to learn about experience for therapy personalization. Furthermore, great efforts are dedicated to develop miniaturized artificial kidneys to achieve a continuous and personalized dialysis therapy, in order to improve the patient's quality of life. These innovative dialysis devices will require a real-time monitoring of equipment alarms, dialysis parameters, and patient-related data to ensure patient safety and to allow instantaneous changes of the dialysis prescription for the assessment of their adequacy. The analysis and evaluation of the resulting large-scale data sets enters the realm of \"big data\" and will require real-time predictive models. These may come from the fields of machine learning and computational intelligence, both included in artificial intelligence, a branch of engineering involved with the creation of devices that simulate intelligent behavior. The incorporation of artificial intelligence should provide a fully new approach to data analysis, enabling future advances in personalized dialysis therapies. With the purpose to learn about the present and potential future impact on medicine from experts in artificial intelligence and machine learning, a scientific meeting was organized in the Hospital Universitari Bellvitge (L'Hospitalet, Barcelona). As an outcome of that meeting, the aim of this review is to investigate artificial intel ligence experiences on dialysis, with a focus on potential barriers, challenges, and prospects for future applications of these technologies.\nArtificial intelligence research on dialysis is still in an early stage, and the main challenge relies on interpretability and/or comprehensibility of data models when applied to decision making. Artificial neural networks and medical decision support systems have been used to make predictions about anemia, total body water, or intradialysis hypotension and are promising approaches for the prescription and monitoring of hemodialysis therapy. Current dialysis machines are continuously improving due to innovative technological developments, but patient safety is still a key challenge. Real-time monitoring systems, coupled with automatic instantaneous biofeedback, will allow changing dialysis prescriptions continuously. The integration of vital sign monitoring with dialysis parameters will produce large data sets that will require the use of data analysis techniques, possibly from the area of machine learning, in order to make better decisions and increase the safety of patients.", "In this follow-up to my 2002 article on working memory capacity, fluid intelligence, and executive attention in Current Directions in Psychological Science, I review even more evidence supporting the idea that the ability to control one's attention (i.e., executive attention) is important to working memory and fluid intelligence. I now argue that working memory tasks reflect primarily the maintenance of information, whereas fluid intelligence tests reflect primarily the ability to disengage from recently attended and no longer useful information. I also point out some conclusions in the 2002 article that now appear to be wrong.", "It is widely known that individuals frequently imitate each other in social situations and that such mimicry fulfills an important social role in the sense that it functions as a social glue. With reference to the anticipated action effect, it has recently been demonstrated that individuals do not only imitate others, but also engage in anticipated action before the observed person starts engaging in that action. Interestingly, both phenomena (i.e., mimicry and anticipated action) rely on tracking others' social behavior. Therefore, in the present research we investigated whether mimicry and anticipated action are related to social abilities as indicated by measures of social intelligence. The results demonstrate for the first time that mimicry as well as anticipated action is correlated with an important aspect of social intelligence-namely the ability to process social information. Theoretical implications and limitations are discussed.", "To date, the program for the development of methods and models for atomistic and continuum simulation directed toward chemicals and materials has reached an incredible degree of sophistication and maturity. Currently, one can witness an increasingly rapid emergence of advances in computing, artificial intelligence, and robotics. This drives us to consider the future of computer simulation of matter from the molecular to the human length and time scales in a radical way that deliberately dares to go beyond the foreseeable next steps in any given discipline. This perspective article presents a view on this future development that we believe is likely to become a reality during our lifetime.", "Smartphones, artificial intelligence, automation, digital communication, and other types of technology are playing an increasingly important role in our daily lives. It is no surprise that technology is also shaping the practice of medicine, and more specifically the practice of genetic counseling. While digital tools have been part of the practice of medical genetics for decades, such as internet- or CD-ROM-based tools like Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man and Pictures of Standard Syndromes and Undiagnosed Malformations in the 1980s, the potential for emerging tools to change how we practice and the way patients consume information is startling. Technology has the potential to aid in at-risk patient identification, assist in generating a differential diagnosis, improve efficiency in medical history collection and risk assessment, provide educational support for patients, and streamline follow-up. Here we review the historic and current uses of technology in genetic counseling, identify challenges to integration, and propose future applications of technology that can shape the practice of genetic counseling.", "Multiple Micronutrient (MMN) supplementation during pregnancy can decrease the proportion of infants born low birth weight and small for gestational age. Supplementation could also enhance children's cognitive function by improving access to key nutrients during fetal brain development and increasing birth weight, especially in areas where undernutrition is common. We tested the hypothesis that children whose mothers received MMN supplementation during pregnancy would have higher intelligence in early adolescence compared with those receiving Iron and Folic Acid (IFA) only.\nWe followed up children in Nepal, whose mothers took part in a double-blind Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT) that compared the effects on birth weight and gestational duration of antenatal MMN versus IFA supplementation. We assessed children's Full Scale Intelligence Quotient (FSIQ) using the Universal Non-verbal Intelligence Test (UNIT), and their executive function using the counting Stroop test. The parent trial was registered as ISRCTN88625934.\nWe identified 813 (76%) of the 1069 children whose mothers took part in the parent trial. We found no differences in FSIQ at 12 years between MMN and IFA groups (absolute difference in means (diff): 1.25, 95% CI -0.57 to 3.06). Similarly, there were no differences in mean UNIT memory (diff: 1.41, 95% CI -0.48 to 3.30), reasoning (diff: 1.17, 95% CI -0.72 to 3.06), symbolic (diff: 0.97, 95% CI -0.67 to 2.60) or non-symbolic quotients (diff: 1.39, 95% CI -0.60 to 3.38).\nOur follow-up of a double-blind RCT in Nepal found no evidence of benefit from antenatal MMN compared with IFA for children's overall intelligence and executive function at 12 years.", "To investigate the effect of a long-term fatty fish intervention on a pure cognitive mechanism important for self-regulation and mental health, i.e. working memory (WM), controlling for age and IQ.\nA randomized controlled trial.\nA forensic facility.\nEighty-four young to middle aged male forensic inpatients with psychiatric disorders.\nConsumption of farmed salmon or control meal (meat) three times a week during 23 weeks.\nPerformance on WM tasks, both accuracy and mean reaction time, were recorded pre and post intervention.\nPerformance on a cognitive functioning tasks taxing WM seemed to be explained by age and IQ.\nFatty fish consumption did not improve WM performance in a group of young to middle aged adults with mental health problems, as less impressionable factors such as aging and intelligence seemed to be the key components. The present study improves the knowledge concerning the interaction among nutrition, health and the aging process.", "Radiographic imaging continues to be one of the most effective and clinically useful tools within oncology. Sophistication of artificial intelligence has allowed for detailed quantification of radiographic characteristics of tissues using predefined engineered algorithms or deep learning methods. Precedents in radiology as well as a wealth of research studies hint at the clinical relevance of these characteristics. However, critical challenges are associated with the analysis of medical imaging data. Although some of these challenges are specific to the imaging field, many others like reproducibility and batch effects are generic and have already been addressed in other quantitative fields such as genomics. Here, we identify these pitfalls and provide recommendations for analysis strategies of medical imaging data, including data normalization, development of robust models, and rigorous statistical analyses. Adhering to these recommendations will not only improve analysis quality but also enhance precision medicine by allowing better integration of imaging data with other biomedical data sources.

According to this thesis, several major intellectual and political movements, such as Boasian anthropology, Freudian psychoanalysis, and multiculturalism, were consciously or unconsciously designed by Jews to (a) promote collectivism and group continuity among themselves in Israel and the diaspora and (b) undermine the cohesion of gentile populations, thus increasing the competitive advantage of Jews and weakening organized gentile resistance (i.e., anti-Semitism). By developing and promoting these movements, Jews supposedly played a necessary role in the ascendancy of liberalism and multiculturalism in the West. While not achieving widespread acceptance among evolutionary scientists, this theory has been enormously influential in the burgeoning political movement known as the \"alt-right.\" Examination of MacDonald's argument suggests that he relies on systematically misrepresented sources and cherry-picked facts. It is argued here that the evidence favors what is termed the \"default hypothesis\": Because of their above-average intelligence and concentration in influential urban areas, Jews in recent history have been overrepresented in all major intellectual and political movements, including conservative movements, that were not overtly anti-Semitic.", "Integrity is a highly desired leadership trait. Authentic leaders reflect on their behavior and seek feedback about how their actions affect others. How can a nurse develop as an authentic leader who consistently demonstrates integrity? The following are discussed: Reflection; Connection to Christ and others; Social and Emotional Intelligence providing perceptive competency and social awareness; Aesthetic Qualities whereby leaders apply experiential knowing in leadership situations; and effective expression of Gratitude as a meaningful act of valuing others.", "Tuberculosis [TB] has afflicted numerous nations in the world. As per a report by the World Health Organization [WHO], an estimated 1.4 million TB deaths in 2015 and an additional 0.4 million deaths resulting from TB disease among people living with HIV, were observed. Most of the TB deaths can be prevented if it is detected at an early stage. The existing processes of diagnosis like blood tests or sputum tests are not only tedious but also take a long time for analysis and cannot differentiate between different drug resistant stages of TB. The need to find newer prompt methods for disease detection has been aided by the latest Artificial Intelligence [AI] tools. Artificial Neural Network [ANN] is one of the important tools that is being used widely in diagnosis and evaluation of medical conditions. This review aims at providing brief introduction to various AI tools that are used in TB detection and gives a detailed description about the utilization of ANN as an efficient diagnostic technique. The paper also provides a critical assessment of ANN and the existing techniques for their diagnosis of TB. Researchers and Practitioners in the field are looking forward to use ANN and other upcoming AI tools such as Fuzzy-logic, genetic algorithms and artificial intelligence simulation as a promising current and future technology tools towards tackling the global menace of Tuberculosis. Latest advancements in the diagnostic field include the combined use of ANN with various other AI tools like the Fuzzy-logic, which has led to an increase in the efficacy and specificity of the diagnostic techniques.", "To contribute to neuropsychological profiling of developmental amnesia subsequent to bilateral damage to both hippocampi in early age.\nThe total sample of 24 schoolchildren from both sexes is distributed in three groups: perinatal hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy and everyday complaints of memory in school age (n = 8); perinatal hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy without memory complaints (n = 7); and a group of typically developing (n = 9). All participants in every groups did have normal general intelligence and attention. Both clinical groups had, as another clinical consequence, spastic cerebral palsy (diplegia). Neuropsychological exam consisted on tests of general intelligence, attentional abilities, declarative memory and semantic knowledge. All participants had a brain magnetic resonance image and spectroscopy of hippocampi. Scheltens criteria were used for visual estimation of hippocampal atrophy. Parametric and non-parametric statistical contrasts were made.\nDespite preservation of semantic and procedural learning, declarative-episodic memory is impaired in the first group versus the other two groups. A significant proportion of bilateral hippocampal atrophy is only present in the first group versus the other two non-amnesic groups using Scheltens estimation on MRI. Two cases without evident atrophy did have diminished NAA/(Cho + Cr) index in both hippocampi.\nTaken together, these results contribute to delineate developmental amnesia as an specific impairment due to early partial bihippocampal damage, in agreement with previous studies. After diagnosis of developmental amnesia, a specific psychoeducational intervention must be made; also this impairment could be candidate for pharmacological trials in the future.\nAmnesia del desarrollo y da\u00f1o cerebral temprano: neuropsicologia y neuroimagen.\nObjetivo. Contribuir a la descripcion de la amnesia del desarrollo como sindrome especifico en ni\u00f1os que sufrieron agresion temprana, pero no masiva, de ambos hipocampos. Sujetos y metodos. Muestra de 24 escolares de ambos sexos, de 6-16 a\u00f1os de edad. Se distribuye en tres grupos: pacientes afectos de encefalopatia hipoxico-isquemica perinatal, con paralisis cerebral espastica, inteligencia normal y fallos de memoria (n = 8); pacientes con similares caracteristicas, pero sin quejas de memoria (n = 7); y escolares sanos sin antecedentes de riesgo (n = 9) como grupo control. Se aplican escalas y tests para comprobar la normalidad intelectual y atencional, y para medir el perfil de rendimiento en tareas de memoria. En todos los sujetos, mediante resonancia magnetica, se estima la presencia y grado de atrofia hipocampica con la escala de Scheltens, y se calcula el indice espectroscopico NAA/(Cho + Cr). Resultados. El perfil neuropsicologico de los ocho pacientes del primer grupo es claramente sugestivo de amnesia del desarrollo, que contrasta con la normalidad en los otros grupos. En siete escolares con amnesia se constata bilateralmente algun grado de atrofia bihipocampica o disminucion significativa del indice NAA/(Cho + Cr). Conclusiones. La amnesia del desarrollo se caracteriza por afectacion de la memoria episodica con preservacion del aprendizaje semantico y procedimental. Se explica por da\u00f1o parcial bihipocampico temprano. El correcto diagnostico permite una intervencion psicoeducativa especifica. En el futuro cabria ensayar terapias farmacologicas asociadas a la intervencion psicoeducativa.", "Assortative mating has been studied on a broad range of variables, including intelligence and personality traits. In the present study we analysed the effect of assortative mating for ability emotional intelligence (EI) on a sample of heterosexual couples (N\u00a0=\u00a0382), including dating and married couples. Correlation analyses revealed moderate similarity of Pearson's r\u00a0=\u00a0.27 for general EI score, and was slightly weaker (from .18 to .23) for branch scores. Regression analyses showed that the Perception branch was the strongest single predictor of a partner's general EI score, both in males and females. Continuous parameter estimation (CPEM) revealed that the magnitude of the correlation does not increase with age, thus it is highly possible that the obtained similarity reflects initial assortment (i.e., similarity at the starting point of the relationship), rather than convergence (i.e., increasing similarity with time). It seems that EI is a significant factor influencing mate assortment processes.", "Finding a valid diagnosis is mostly a prolonged process. Current advances in the sector of artificial intelligence have led to the appearance of expert systems that enrich the experiences and capabilities of doctors for making decisions for their patients.\nThe objective of this research was developing a fuzzy expert system for diagnosing Cystic Fibrosis (CF).\nDefining the risk factors and then, designing the fuzzy expert system for diagnosis of CF were carried out in this cross-sectional study. To evaluate the performance of the proposed system, a dataset that corresponded to 70 patients with respiratory disease who were serially admitted to the CF Clinic in the Pediatric Respiratory Diseases Center, Masih Daneshvari Hospital in Tehran, Iran during August 2016 to January 2017 was considered. Whole procedures of system construction were implemented in a MATLAB environment.\nResults showed that the suggested system can be used as a strong diagnostic tool with 93.02% precision, 89.29% specificity, 95.24% sensitivity and 92.86% accuracy for diagnosing CF. There was also a good relationship between the user and the system through the appealing user interface.\nThe system is equipped with information, knowledge, and expertise from certified specialists; hence, as a training tool it can be useful for new physicians. It is worth mentioning that the accomplishment of this project depends on advocacy of decision making in CF diagnosis. Nevertheless, it is expected that the system will reduce the number of false positives and false negatives in unusual cases.", "AbstractThe ability to provide accurate DNA-based forensic intelligence requires analysis of multiple DNA markers to predict the biogeographical ancestry (BGA) and externally visible characteristics (EVCs) of the donor of biological evidence. Massively parallel sequencing (MPS) enables the analysis of hundreds of DNA markers in multiple samples simultaneously, increasing the value of the intelligence provided to forensic investigators while reducing the depletion of evidential material resulting from multiple analyses. The Precision ID Ancestry Panel (formerly the HID Ion AmpliSeq\u2122 Ancestry Panel) (Thermo Fisher Scientific) (TFS)) consists of 165 autosomal SNPs selected to infer BGA. Forensic validation criteria were applied to 95 samples using this panel to assess sensitivity (1 ng-15 pg), reproducibility (inter- and intra-run variability) and effects of compromised and forensic casework type samples (artificially degraded and inhibited, mixed source and aged blood and bone samples). BGA prediction accuracy was assessed using samples from individuals who self-declared their ancestry as being from single populations of origin (n = 36) or from multiple populations of origin (n = 14). Sequencing was conducted on Ion 318\u2122 chips (TFS) on the Ion PGM\u2122 System (TFS). HID SNP Genotyper v4.3.1 software (TFS) was used to perform BGA predictions based on admixture proportions (continental level) and likelihood estimates (sub-population level). BGA prediction was accurate at DNA template amounts of 125pg and 30pg using 21 and 25 PCR cycles respectively. HID SNP Genotyper continental level BGA assignments were concordant with BGAs for self-declared East Asian, African, European and South Asian individuals. Compromised, mixed source and admixed samples, in addition to sub-population level prediction, requires more extensive analysis.", "Cavum septum pellucidum (CSP) is a neuroanatomical variant of the septum pellucidum that is considered a marker for disrupted brain development. Several small sample studies have reported CSP to be related to disruptive behavior, persistent antisocial traits, and even psychopathy. However, no large-scale samples have comprehensively examined the relationship between CSP, psychopathic traits, and antisocial behavior in forensic samples. Here we test hypotheses about the presence of CSP and its relationship to psychopathic traits in incarcerated males (N\u202f=\u202f1432). We also examined the incidence of CSP in two non-incarcerated male control samples for comparison (N\u202f=\u202f208 and 125). Ethnic and racial composition was varied with a mean age of 33.1, and an average IQ of 96.96. CSP was evaluated via structural magnetic resonance imaging. CSP was measured by length (number of 1.0\u202fmm slices) in continuous analyses, and classified as absent (0) or present (1+\u202fmm), as well as by size (absent (0), small (1-3), medium (4-5), or large (6+\u202fmm)) for comparison with prior work. The Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS-III), Structured Clinical Interview (SCID-I/P), and Hare Psychopathy Checklist-Revised (PCL-R) were used to assess IQ, substance dependence, and psychopathy, respectively. CSP length was positively associated with PCL-R total, Factor 1 (interpersonal/affective) and Facets 1 (interpersonal) and 2 (affective). CSP was no more prevalent among inmates than among non-incarcerated controls, with similar distributions of size. These results support the hypotheses that abnormal septal/limbic development may contribute to dimensional affective/interpersonal traits of psychopathy, but CSP is not closely associated with antisocial behavior, per se.", "In both humans and mice, performance on tests of intelligence or general cognitive ability (GCA) is related to dopamine D1 receptor-mediated activity in the prelimbic cortex, and levels of DRD1 mRNA predict the GCA of mice. Here we assessed the turnover rate of D1 receptors as well as the expression level of the D1 chaperone protein (DRiP78) in the medial PPC (mPFC) of mice to determine whether rate of receptor turnover was associated with variations in the GCA of genetically heterogeneous mice. Following assessment of GCA (aggregate performance on four diverse learning tests) mice were administered an irreversible dopamine receptor antagonist (EEDQ), after which the density of new D1 receptors were quantified. GCA was positively correlated with both the rate of D1 receptor recovery and levels of DRiP78. Additionally, the density of D1 receptors was observed to increase within 60\u2009min (or less) in response to intense demands on working memory, suggesting that a pool of immature receptors was available to accommodate high cognitive loads. These results provide evidence that innate general cognitive abilities are related to D1 receptor turnover rates in the prefrontal cortex, and that an intracellular pool of immature D1 receptors are available to accommodate cognitive demands.", "The concept of intelligence as a measurable trait of intellectual function continues to be an important issue in psychology. Traditionally, a core field of differential psychology and widely employed in applied settings, it is also important in various research fields. Here, I describe development of a new assessment of general intelligence of adults that has no language component and can be administered in about 10 minutes. A total sample of 176 adult participants, from various settings, was assessed with a set of matrix tasks that involved either visuospatial (fluid) or semantic (crystallized) reasoning. The internal consistency was acceptable (\u03b1\u2009=\u2009.748), and there was good four-week test-retest reliability ( r\u2009=\u2009.931). Concurrent validity was demonstrated by a high correlation between the new test and the (seven-subtest version) Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-IV (WAIS-IV) scores ( r\u2009=\u2009.889). A principal component analysis also suggested that the new test measures the same latent construct as the WAIS-IV-thought to be general intelligence. Predictive validity was shown in a subsample of 60 undergraduates by a medium-sized correlation between test scores and grade point average data ( r\u2009=\u2009.396). These preliminary results suggest that the Matrix Matching Test may be a useful research tool.", "When asked to evaluate faces of strangers, people with paranoia show a tendency to rate others as less trustworthy. The present study investigated the impact of arousal on this interpersonal bias, and whether this bias was specific to evaluations of trust or additionally affected other trait judgements. The study also examined the impact of eye gaze direction, as direct eye gaze has been shown to heighten arousal.\nIn two experiments, non-clinical participants completed face rating tasks before and after either an arousal manipulation or control manipulation. Experiment one examined the effects of heightened arousal on judgements of trustworthiness. Experiment two examined the specificity of the bias, and the impact of gaze direction.\nExperiment one indicated that the arousal manipulation led to lower trustworthiness ratings. Experiment two showed that heightened arousal reduced trust evaluations of trustworthy faces, particularly trustworthy faces with averted gaze. The control group rated trustworthy faces with direct gaze as more trustworthy post-manipulation. There was some evidence that attractiveness ratings were affected similarly to the trust judgements, whereas judgements of intelligence were not affected by higher arousal.\nIn both studies, participants reported low levels of arousal even after the manipulation and the use of a non-clinical sample limits the generalisability to clinical samples.\nThere is a complex interplay between arousal, evaluations of trustworthiness and gaze direction. Heightened arousal influences judgements of trustworthiness, but within the context of face type and gaze direction."], "authior": [[["Panagiotidou Elpida"], ["Serrano Francisca"], ["Moreno-Rios
