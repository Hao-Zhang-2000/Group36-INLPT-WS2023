{"abstracts": ["Digital technology has been used in the field of diagnostic breast pathology and immunohistochemistry (IHC) for decades. Examples include automated tissue processing and staining, digital data processing, storing and management, voice recognition systems, and digital technology-based production of antibodies and other IHC reagents. However, the recent application of whole slide imaging technology and artificial intelligence (AI)-based tools has attracted a lot of attention. The use of AI tools in breast pathology is discussed briefly as it is covered in other reviews. Here, we present the main application of digital technology in IHC. This includes automation of IHC staining, using image analysis systems and computer vision technology to interpret IHC staining, and the use of AI-based tools to predict marker expression from haematoxylin and eosin-stained digitalized images.", "Although it has been 30\u2009years since the first automation systems were introduced in the microbiology laboratory, total laboratory automation (TLA) has only recently been recognized as a valuable component of the laboratory. A growing number of publications illustrate the potential impact of automation. TLA can improve standardization, increase laboratory efficiency, increase workplace safety, and reduce long-term costs.\nThis review provides a preview of the current state of automation in clinical microbiology and covers the main developments during the last years. We describe the available hardware systems (that range from single function devices to multifunction workstations) and the challenging alterations on workflow and organization of the laboratory that have to be implemented to optimize automation.\nDespite the many advantages in efficiency, productivity, and timeliness that automation offers, it is not without new and unique challenges. For every advantage that laboratory automation provides, there are similar challenges that a laboratory must face. Change management strategies should be used to lead to a successful implementation. TLA represents, moreover, a substantial initial investment. Nevertheless, if properly approached, there are a number of important benefits that can be achieved through implementation of automation in the clinical microbiology laboratory. Future developments in the field of automation will likely focus on image analysis and artificial intelligence improvements. Patient care, however, should remain the epicenter of all future directions and there will always be a need for clinical microbiology expertise to interpret the complex clinical and laboratory information.", "The detection and identification of ignitable liquid (IL) residues in fire debris are two very challenging tasks in a fire investigation. To this day, the recognition of IL in fire debris includes the chemical analysis of the fire debris composition, followed by the examination and interpretation of the analysis result by a trained forensic examiner. Throughout the last decade, chemometrics and artificial intelligence have become increasingly important. In the present study, machine learning algorithms capable of recognizing gasoline residues in fire debris based on GC-MS data have been developed. Four methods, including random forest, gradient boosting, support vector machine, and na\u00efve bayes are applied and used to classify fire debris samples into the two categories \"with gasoline\" or \"without gasoline\". A fifth method (logistic regression) did not converge due to well separated classes. A database comprising 360 measurements, including fire debris samples of real cases as well as fire debris samples spiked with known amounts of weathered gasoline (up to 99.6%), was available to train the machine learning algorithms (using 85% of the data) and to subsequently test the performance of the methods when classifying unknown samples (using 15% of the data). In general, the methods perform very well, as three of it succeeded to classify all test samples correctly without any false positive or false negative allocations. One (na\u00efve bayes) was not trained enough to classify other (non-gasoline) IL correctly as \"no gasoline\". Furthermore, the random forest method reveals which chemical compounds are most relevant for the algorithm to classify the samples. In general, the presented approach is highly promising and could easily be extended or adapted to other types of IL. Similar to the neural network presented in the accompanying paper, such methods have the potential to serve as a fast screening technique for fire debris samples, thus supporting the forensic examiner by providing an additional independent opinion. Nonetheless, the definite identification of IL residues in fire debris always has to be accomplished by a forensic examiner.", "We sought to automate R.E.N.A.L. (for radius, exophytic/endophytic, nearness of tumor to collecting system, anterior/posterior, location relative to polar line) nephrometry scoring of preoperative computerized tomography scans and create an artificial intelligence-generated score (AI-score). Subsequently, we aimed to evaluate its ability to predict meaningful oncologic and perioperative outcomes as compared to expert human-generated nephrometry scores (H-scores).\nA total of 300 patients with preoperative computerized tomography were identified from a cohort of 544 consecutive patients undergoing surgical extirpation for suspected renal cancer at a single institution. A deep neural network approach was used to automatically segment kidneys and tumors, and geometric algorithms were developed to estimate components of R.E.N.A.L. nephrometry score. Tumors were independently scored by medical personnel blinded to AI-scores. AI- and H-score agreement was assessed using Lin's concordance correlation and their predictive abilities for both oncologic and perioperative outcomes were assessed using areas under the curve.\nMedian age was 60 years (IQE 51-68), and 40% were female. Median tumor size was 4.2 cm and 91.3% had malignant tumors, including 27%, 37% and 24% with high stage, grade and necrosis, respectively. There was significant agreement between H-scores and AI-scores (Lin's \u2374=0.59). Both AI- and H-scores similarly predicted meaningful oncologic outcomes (p <0.001) including presence of malignancy, necrosis, and high-grade and -stage disease (p <0.003). They also predicted surgical approach (p <0.004) and specific perioperative outcomes (p <0.05).\nFully automated AI-generated R.E.N.A.L. scores are comparable to human-generated R.E.N.A.L. scores and predict a wide variety of meaningful patient-centered outcomes. This unambiguous artificial intelligence-based scoring is intended to facilitate wider adoption of the R.E.N.A.L. score.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) apps hold great potential to make pathological diagnoses more accurate and time efficient. Widespread use of AI in pathology is hampered by interface incompatibilities between pathology software. We studied the existing interfaces in order to develop the EMPAIA App Interface, an open standard for the integration of pathology AI apps.\nThe EMPAIA App Interface relies on widely-used web communication protocols and containerization. It consists of three parts: A standardized format to describe the semantics of an app, a mechanism to deploy and execute apps in computing environments, and a web API through which apps can exchange data with a host application.\nFive commercial AI app manufacturers successfully adapted their products to the EMPAIA App Interface and helped improve it with their feedback. Open source tools facilitate the adoption of the interface by providing reusable data access and scheduling functionality and enabling automatic validation of app compliance.\nExisting AI apps and pathology software can be adapted to the EMPAIA App Interface with little effort. It is a viable alternative to the proprietary interfaces of current software. If enough vendors join in, the EMPAIA App Interface can help to advance the use of AI in pathology.", "This cross-sectional survey study examined the relationship between Canadian nurses' work environment characteristics, emotional intelligence, compassion fatigue and compassion satisfaction (n = 1271). Psychological demands, decision latitude, supervisor and coworker support, and emotional intelligence (EI) were significantly correlated with nurses' compassion satisfaction and compassion fatigue, except for two EI subscales. Furthermore, these relationships were stronger for compassion satisfaction than compassion fatigue, suggesting that they are influenced by different factors. Our results highlight the importance of creating reasonable psychological demands, empowering nurses to make decisions in their jobs, supportive relationships at work, and fostering the development of nurses' EI.", "Emotional intelligence, or the ability to perceive, understand, and regulate emotions, has been identified as a protective factor for one's adaptation. Measuring emotional intelligence using performance-based approach is thought to be objective and effective. However, performance-based emotional intelligence instruments for non-Western adolescents are rarely available. To facilitate research on emotional intelligence, the present study developed and validated the emotional intelligence test for adolescents (A-EIT) using a Chinese sample. Study 1 (N = 1,536) showed that emotional intelligence consists of three subabilities (i.e., emotion perception, emotion understanding, and emotion regulation) and identified eligible items for each subtest through exploratory factor analysis (EFA). Study 2 (N = 2,568) confirmed the three-factor structure and its measurement invariance across gender and age groups by (multiple-group) confirmatory factor analyses. Both the full test and its three subtests showed acceptable internal consistencies, and their scores increased with age and showed female advantage. Also, the A-EIT scores were significantly correlated with indicators related to emotional and cognitive skills (convergent validity) and were independent of personality (discriminant validity). Additionally, higher scores on the A-EIT were related to better intrapersonal, interpersonal, and academic adaption (criterion validity), as expected. Study 3 (N = 163) provided further convergent validity evidence for each subtest by using validity tools not based on an emotional intelligence framework. Additionally, the A-EIT displayed satisfactory test-retest reliability. Generally, the A-EIT appears to be a valid and reliable instrument to assess adolescents' emotion intelligence, especially those with relatively low level.

A pitch fatigue detection method that includes acquisition, analysis, quantification, aggregation, learning, and public layers for adaptive baseball learning is proposed herein. The learning determines the fatigue index of the pitcher based on the angle of the pitcher's elbow and back as the number of pitches increases. The coach uses this auxiliary information to avoid baseball injuries during baseball learning. Results show a test accuracy rate of 89.1%, indicating that the proposed method effectively provides reference information for adaptive baseball learning.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) is here to stay. It is not a future anymore, and there are many particular problems in cardiology that are already being solved via machine learning (ML), and many more are to come. AI cannot solve complex tasks yet, and probably this will not change in the upcoming years. Therefore, cardiologists do not have to be afraid that computers will replace them. However, cardiologists who will not be able to use ML algorithms in their clinical practice will be replaced by those who will. (Fig. 2, Ref. 50).

The use of Computer Aided Diagnosis (CAD) systems can be a powerful tool for clinicians, especially in situations when hospitals are overflowed. These tools are usually based on artificial intelligence (AI), a field that has been recently revolutionized by deep learning approaches. These alternatives usually obtain a large performance based on complex solutions, leading to a high computational cost and the need of having large databases. In this work, we propose a classification framework based on sparse coding. Images are first partitioned into different tiles, and a dictionary is built after applying PCA to these tiles. The original signals are then transformed as a linear combination of the elements of the dictionary. Then, they are reconstructed by iteratively deactivating the elements associated with each component. Classification is finally performed employing as features the subsequent reconstruction errors. Performance is evaluated in a real context where distinguishing between four different pathologies: control versus bacterial pneumonia versus viral pneumonia versus COVID-19. Our system differentiates between pneumonia patients and controls with an accuracy of 97.74%, whereas in the 4-class context the accuracy is 86.73%. The excellent results and the pioneering use of sparse coding in this scenario evidence that our proposal can assist clinicians when their workload is high.", "The achievement of new bonding patterns of atoms in compounds is of great importance, which usually induces interesting physical and chemical properties. Rich oxidation states, diverse bonding types, and unique aurophilic attraction endow gold (Au) as a distinctive element. Here we report that a pressure-induced Li5AuP2, identified by a swarm intelligence-based structural prediction, becomes the first example of Au with sp3 hybridization. The most remarkable feature of Li5AuP2 is that it contains various frameworks made by AuP4, AuLi4, LiP4, and blende-like Li-P units, exhibiting noncentrosymmetry. The charge transfer from Li to Au makes Au 6p orbitals activate and hybridize with the 6s one. On the other hand, Li donating electrons to P and polar Au-P covalence make the constituent atoms satisfy the octet rule, rendering Li5AuP2 with a semiconducting character and a large second-order nonlinear optical response in the near-infrared region. Our work represents a significant step toward extending the understanding of gold chemistry.", "Most early lung cancers present as pulmonary nodules on imaging, but these can be easily missed on chest radiographs.\nTo assess if a novel artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm can help detect pulmonary nodules on radiographs at different levels of detection difficulty.\nThis diagnostic study included 100 posteroanterior chest radiograph images taken between 2000 and 2010 of adult patients from an ambulatory health care center in Germany and a lung image database in the US. Included images were selected to represent nodules with different levels of detection difficulties (from easy to difficult), and comprised both normal and nonnormal control.\nAll images were processed with a novel AI algorithm, the AI Rad Companion Chest X-ray. Two thoracic radiologists established the ground truth and 9 test radiologists from Germany and the US independently reviewed all images in 2 sessions (unaided and AI-aided mode) with at least a 1-month washout period.\nEach test radiologist recorded the presence of 5 findings (pulmonary nodules, atelectasis, consolidation, pneumothorax, and pleural effusion) and their level of confidence for detecting the individual finding on a scale of 1 to 10 (1 representing lowest confidence; 10, highest confidence). The analyzed metrics for nodules included sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and receiver operating characteristics curve area under the curve (AUC).\nImages from 100 patients were included, with a mean (SD) age of 55 (20) years and including 64 men and 36 women. Mean detection accuracy across the 9 radiologists improved by 6.4% (95% CI, 2.3% to 10.6%) with AI-aided interpretation compared with unaided interpretation. Partial AUCs within the effective interval range of 0 to 0.2 false positive rate improved by 5.6% (95% CI, -1.4% to 12.0%) with AI-aided interpretation. Junior radiologists saw greater improvement in sensitivity for nodule detection with AI-aided interpretation as compared with their senior counterparts (12%; 95% CI, 4% to 19% vs 9%; 95% CI, 1% to 17%) while senior radiologists experienced similar improvement in specificity (4%; 95% CI, -2% to 9%) as compared with junior radiologists (4%; 95% CI, -3% to 5%).\nIn this diagnostic study, an AI algorithm was associated with improved detection of pulmonary nodules on chest radiographs compared with unaided interpretation for different levels of detection difficulty and for readers with different experience.", "Big data (BD) and artificial intelligence (AI) have increasingly been used in neurocritical care. \"BD\" can be operationally defined as extremely large datasets that are so large and complex that they cannot be analyzed by using traditional statistical modeling. \"AI\" means the ability of machines to perform tasks similar to those performed by human intelligence. We present a brief overview of the most commonly applied AI techniques to perform BD analytics and discuss some of the recent promising examples in the field of neurocritical care. The latter include the following: cognitive motor dissociation in disorders of consciousness, hypoxic-ischemic injury following cardiac arrest, delayed cerebral ischemia and vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage, and monitoring of intracranial pressure. It is imperative that we develop multicenter collaborations to tackle BD. These collaborations will allow us to share data, combine predictive algorithms, and analyze multiple and cumulative sources of data retrospectively and prospectively. Once AI algorithms are validated at multiple centers, they should be tested in randomized controlled trials investigating their impact on clinical outcome. The neurocritical care community must work to ensure that AI incorporates standards to ensure fairness and health equity rather than reflect our biases present in our collective conscience.", "We argue that artificial networks are explainable and offer a novel theory of interpretability. Two sets of conceptual questions are prominent in theoretical engagements with artificial neural networks, especially in the context of medical artificial intelligence: (1) Are networks explainable, and if so, what does it mean to explain the output of a network? And (2) what does it mean for a network to be interpretable? We argue that accounts of \"explanation\" tailored specifically to neural networks have ineffectively reinvented the wheel. In response to (1), we show how four familiar accounts of explanation apply to neural networks as they would to any scientific phenomenon. We diagnose the confusion about explaining neural networks within the machine learning literature as an equivocation on \"explainability,\" \"understandability\" and \"interpretability.\" To remedy this, we distinguish between these notions, and answer (2) by offering a theory and typology of interpretation in machine learning. Interpretation is something one does to an explanation with the aim of producing another, more understandable, explanation. As with explanation, there are various concepts and methods involved in interpretation: Total or Partial, Global or Local, and Approximative or Isomorphic. Our account of \"interpretability\" is consistent with uses in the machine learning literature, in keeping with the philosophy of explanation and understanding, and pays special attention to medical artificial intelligence systems.", "The COVID-19 pandemic created significant challenges for academic health systems (AHSs) across their tripartite mission of providing clinical care, conducting research, and educating learners. Despite these challenges, AHSs played an invaluable role in responding to the pandemic. Clinicians worked tirelessly to care for patients, and institutions quickly reoriented their care delivery systems. Furthermore, AHSs played an important role in advancing science, launching studies and clinical trials to examine new vaccines and treatments for COVID-19. However, there is room for improvement; AHSs can use lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic to reshape their operations for the future. To prepare for the next pandemic, AHSs must modernize, adapt, and transform their clinical operations, research infrastructure, and educational programs to include public health and to build surveillance capacity for detecting, monitoring, and managing emerging outbreaks. In this Invited Commentary, the authors describe the opportunities AHSs have to build on their experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic and the ways they can take advantage of their unique strengths in each of their 3 mission areas. Within clinical care, AHSs can reach patients outside traditional clinical settings, build national and regional networks, advance data-driven insights, engage with the community, and support and protect the workforce. Within research, they can leverage data science and artificial intelligence, perform pandemic forecasting, leverage the social and behavioral sciences, conduct clinical trials, and build a research and development preparedness and operational plan. Within education, AHSs can promote remote learning, make interprofessional learning the norm, and build a system of continuing education.", "Monitoring the function of essential organ systems is a hallmark of critical care. In combination with the medical history, physical examination and selective diagnostic tests. Monitoring facilitates the bed-side diagnosis of many diseases in critical care and guides therapeutic management while providing optimal patient safety. The availability of monitoring compensates in the very often complex and multimorbid patients and the very dynamic course of their diseases the lack of universally applicable treatment protocols, that are based on the results of randomized critical care trials. In the future clinical decision support systems based on artificial intelligence might support intensivists in the analysis of monitoring data in terms of individual prognosis assessment and choice of therapy.", "Health professions education (HPE) emerged as a specific domain of higher education in the 1960s. The interim decades brought the development of advanced training in health professions education and the implementation of HPE offices at many institutions of healthcare and education across the world. Despite these advancements, organizations considering the establishment of HPE offices, or advanced HPE training programs are still challenged by approving authorities to demonstrate that HPE is a discipline and not simply a branch of higher education. Although other scholars have proposed defined characteristics to guide the recognition of study fields as separate academic disciplines, Krishnan's framework is easily operationalized and its use has been broadly reported in the management, education, and intelligence studies literature, among others. Krishnan contends that an academic discipline generally presents the following characteristics: (1) an object of study and research that, although particular to the discipline, can be common to others; (2) a body of specialized knowledge, relative to the subject of study and research, typically unique to the discipline; (3) theories and concepts that frame and organize the specialized knowledge of the discipline; (4) specific terminologies or technical language related to the subject of study and research; (5) research methods adapted to the particular demands of the discipline; and (6) an institutional presence demonstrated by teaching at the graduate level of subjects specific to the discipline, and by the existence of academic departments and professional associations. The purpose of this paper is to present arguments in support of the status of HPE as an academic discipline using Krishnan's framework. It is our hope that these arguments will facilitate the efforts of organizations planning for the establishment of HPE offices or advanced HPE training programs at their institutions.", "Iron plays a role in many key processes in the developing brain. During pregnancy, iron supplementation is widely recommended to prevent and treat iron deficiency; however, the prevalence of iron deficiency and the risk of iron overload vary greatly between populations. Evidence on the role of high levels of maternal ferritin, a storage iron marker during pregnancy in relation to offspring neurodevelopment is lacking.\nOur main objective was to examine if maternal ferritin levels during pregnancy are associated with child cognitive and motor abilities.\nWe included Dutch mother-child dyads from the prospective population-based Generation R Study, born in 2002-2006. We compared children whose mothers had high (standard deviation score >+1) or low (standard deviation score <-1) early-pregnancy ferritin to children whose mothers had intermediate ferritin (reference group) using linear regression. Children underwent non-verbal intelligence and language tests at 4-9\u00a0years (cognitive abilities), finger-tapping and balancing tests at 8-12\u00a0years (motor abilities), and structural magnetic resonance imaging at 8-12\u00a0years (brain morphology). Covariates were child age, sex, maternal intelligence quotient estimate, age, body-mass-index, education, parity, smoking and alcohol use.\nOf the 2479 mother-child dyads with data on maternal ferritin and at least one child neurodevelopmental outcome, 387 mothers had low (mean\u00a0=\u00a020.6\u00a0\u00b5g/L), 1700 intermediate (mean\u00a0=\u00a064.6\u00a0\u00b5g/L) and 392 high (mean\u00a0=\u00a0170.3\u00a0\u00b5g/L) early-pregnancy ferritin. High maternal ferritin was associated with 2.54 points (95% confidence interval -4.16, -0.92) lower child intelligence quotient and 16.02\u00a0cm3 (95% confidence interval -30.57, -1.48) smaller brain volume. Results remained similar after excluding mothers with high C-reactive protein. Low maternal ferritin was not associated with child cognitive abilities. Maternal ferritin was unrelated to child motor outcomes.\nHigh maternal ferritin during pregnancy was associated with poorer child cognitive abilities and smaller brain volume. Maternal iron status during pregnancy may be associated with offspring neurodevelopment.", "Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) has the similar curative effects to surgery, but RFA will lead to higher postoperative local recurrence rate. 3D-CEUS is a minimally invasive examination method, which is used to analyze the sensitivity to postoperative recurrence in this study.\nThe clinical data of 60 patients with liver cancer admitted to our hospital (February 2018-February 2020) were retrospectively analyzed. All patients were treated with RFA and were followed up with 3D-CEUS, MRI, and enhanced CT examination after surgery. The ROC curve was used to analyze the differences of different examination methods in judging postoperative recurrence.\nFor the 60 patients, 52 patients (86.7%) had a single lesion and 8 patients (13.3%) had multiple lesions, with a total of 72 lesions. After RFA, 56 lesions (77.8%) were completely inactivated and 16 lesions (22.2%) remained. Totally inactivated lesions were detected as follows: 51 (91.1%) by 3D-CEUS, 42 (75.0%) by MRI, and 50 (89.3%) by enhanced CT. During a 2-year follow-up, a total of 26 recurrent lesions were detected, 24 (92.3%) by 3D-CEUS, 12 (46.2%) by MRI, and 25 (96.2%) by enhanced CT, indicating that the sensitivity of 3D-CEUS and enhanced CT was obviously higher than that of MRI (P < 0.001), without conspicuous difference between sensitivity of 3D-CEUS and enhanced CT (P > 0.05).\nAs a new imaging examination method based on artificial intelligence, 3D-CEUS has a high sensitivity in patients with liver cancer who underwent RFA, which can effectively judge the recurrence after surgery and should be widely used in practice.", "The mitotic count (MC) is an important histological parameter for prognostication of malignant neoplasms. However, it has inter- and intraobserver discrepancies due to difficulties in selecting the region of interest (MC-ROI) and in identifying or classifying mitotic figures (MFs). Recent progress in the field of artificial intelligence has allowed the development of high-performance algorithms that may improve standardization of the MC. As algorithmic predictions are not flawless, computer-assisted review by pathologists may ensure reliability. In the present study, we compared partial (MC-ROI preselection) and full (additional visualization of MF candidates and display of algorithmic confidence values) computer-assisted MC analysis to the routine (unaided) MC analysis by 23 pathologists for whole-slide images of 50 canine cutaneous mast cell tumors (ccMCTs). Algorithmic predictions aimed to assist pathologists in detecting mitotic hotspot locations, reducing omission of MFs, and improving classification against imposters. The interobserver consistency for the MC significantly increased with computer assistance (interobserver correlation coefficient, ICC = 0.92) compared to the unaided approach (ICC = 0.70). Classification into prognostic stratifications had a higher accuracy with computer assistance. The algorithmically preselected hotspot MC-ROIs had a consistently higher MCs than the manually selected MC-ROIs. Compared to a ground truth (developed with immunohistochemistry for phosphohistone H3), pathologist performance in detecting individual MF was augmented when using computer assistance (F1-score of 0.68 increased to 0.79) with a reduction in false negatives by 38%. The results of this study demonstrate that computer assistance may lead to more reproducible and accurate MCs in ccMCTs.", "This study aimed to investigate the application of positron emission tomography- (PET-) computed tomography (CT) image information data combined with serous cavity effusion based on clone selection artificial intelligence algorithm in the diagnosis of patients with malignant tumors. A total of 97 patients with PET-CT scanning and empirically confirmed as serous cavity effusion were retrospectively analyzed in this study. The clone selection artificial intelligence algorithm was applied to register the PET-CT images, and the patients were rolled into a benign effusion group and a malignant effusion group according to the benign and malignant conditions of the serous cavity effusion. Besides, the causes of patients from the two groups were analyzed, and there was a comparison of their physiological conditions. Subsequently, CT values of different KeV, lipid/water, water/iodine, and water/calcium concentrations were measured, and the differences of the above quantitative parameters between benign and malignant serous cavity effusion were compared, as well as the registration results of the clone algorithm. The results showed that the registration time and misalignment times of clonal selection algorithm (13.88, 0) were lower than those of genetic algorithm (18.72, 8). There were marked differences in CT values of 40-60\u2009keV and 130-140\u2009keV between the two groups. The concentrations of lipid/water, water/iodine, and water/calcium in basal substances of the malignant effusion group were obviously higher than the concentrations of the benign effusion group (P < 0.05). Benign and malignant effusions presented different manifestations in PET-CT, which was conducive to the further diagnosis of malignant tumors. Based on clone selection artificial intelligence algorithm, PET-CT could provide a new multiparameter method for the identification of benign and malignant serous cavity effusions and benign and malignant tumors.", "Earlier research has identified both synergistic and compensatory personality traits by intelligence interaction effects on academic performance.\nThe present study employed data on intelligence, personality traits, and academic performance in the 1997 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY97, N\u2009=\u20098984).\nSome intelligence by personality trait interaction effects, mainly involving indicators of dependability, on high school grades were identified. The interaction effects tended to be synergistic, meaning that the association between the trait and grades tended to strengthen with increased intelligence. A positive association between intelligence and the reliability in the measurement of a dependability composite score accounted for a substantial portion of the synergistic dependability by intelligence interaction effect on academic performance.\nPersonality trait by intelligence interaction effects on academic performance tend to be synergistic and may, at least to some degree, be due to a positive association between intelligence and reliability in the measurement of personality traits.", "Physiological measures, such as heart rate variability (HRV) and beats per minute (BPM), can be powerful health indicators of respiratory infections. HRV and BPM can be acquired through widely available wrist-worn biometric wearables and smartphones. Successive abnormal changes in these indicators could potentially be an early sign of respiratory infections such as COVID-19. Thus, wearables and smartphones should play a significant role in combating COVID-19 through the early detection supported by other contextual data and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. In this paper, we investigate the role of the heart measurements (i.e., HRV and BPM) collected from wearables and smartphones in demonstrating early onsets of the inflammatory response to the COVID-19. The AI framework consists of two blocks: an interpretable prediction model to classify the HRV measurements status (as normal or affected by inflammation) and a recurrent neural network (RNN) to analyze users' daily status (i.e., textual logs in a mobile application). Both classification decisions are integrated to generate the final decision as either \"potentially COVID-19 infected\" or \"no evident signs of infection\". We used a publicly available dataset, which comprises 186 patients with more than 3200 HRV readings and numerous user textual logs. The first evaluation of the approach showed an accuracy of 83.34 \u00b1 1.68% with 0.91, 0.88, 0.89 precision, recall, and F1-Score, respectively, in predicting the infection two days before the onset of the symptoms supported by a model interpretation using the local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME).", "Technological advances enable the design of systems that interact more closely with humans in a multitude of previously unsuspected fields. Martial arts are not outside the application of these techniques. From the point of view of the modeling of human movement in relation to the learning of complex motor skills, martial arts are of interest because they are articulated around a system of movements that are predefined, or at least, bounded, and governed by the laws of Physics. Their execution must be learned after continuous practice over time. Literature suggests that artificial intelligence algorithms, such as those used for computer vision, can model the movements performed. Thus, they can be compared with a good execution as well as analyze their temporal evolution during learning. We are exploring the application of this approach to model psychomotor performance in Karate combats (called kumites), which are characterized by the explosiveness of their movements. In addition, modeling psychomotor performance in a kumite requires the modeling of the joint interaction of two participants, while most current research efforts in human movement computing focus on the modeling of movements performed individually. Thus, in this work, we explore how to apply a pose estimation algorithm to extract the features of some predefined movements of Ippon Kihon kumite (a one-step conventional assault) and compare classification metrics with four data mining algorithms, obtaining high values with them.", "A novel research field in bioinformatics is pharmacogenomics and the corresponding applications of artificial intelligence tools. Pharmacogenomics is the study of the relationship between genotype and responses to medical measures such as drug use. One of the most effective drugs is warfarin anticoagulant, but determining its initial treatment dose is challenging. Mistakes in the determination of the initial treatment dose can result directly in patient death.\nSome of the most successful techniques for estimating the initial treatment dose are kernel-based methods. However, all the available studies use pre-defined and constant kernels that might not necessarily address the problem's intended requirements. The present study seeks to define and present a new computational kernel extracted from a data set. This process aims to utilize all the data-related statistical features to generate a dose determination tool proportional to the data set with minimum error rate. The kernel-based version of the least square support vector regression estimator was defined. Through this method, a more appropriate approach was proposed for predicting the adjusted dose of warfarin.\nThis paper benefits from the International Warfarin Pharmacogenomics Consortium (IWPC) Database. The results obtained in this study demonstrate that the support vector regression with the proposed new kernel can successfully estimate the ideal dosage of warfarin for approximately 68% of patients.", "Objective: To investigate theaccuracy of artificial intelligence sleep staging model in patients with habitual snoring and obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) based on single-channel EEG collected from different locations of the head. Methods: The clinical data of 114 adults with habitual snoring and OSAHS who visited to the Sleep Medicine Center of Beijing Tongren Hospital from September 2020 to March of 2021 were analyzed retrospectively, including 93 males and 21 females, aging from 20 to 64 years old. Eighty-five adults with OSAHS and 29 subjects with habitual snoring were included. Sleep staging analysis was performed on the single lead EEG signals of different locations (FP2-M1, C4-M1, F3-M2, ROG-M1, O1-M2) using the deep learning segmentation model trained by previous data. Manual scoring results were used as the gold standard to analyze the consistency rate of results and the influence of different categories of disease. Results: EEG data in 124 747 30-second epochs were taken as the testing dataset. The model accuracy of distinguishing wake/sleep was 92.3%,92.6%,93.5%,89.2% and 83.0% respectively,based on EEG channel Fp2-M1, C4-M1, F3-M2, REOG-M1 or O1-M2. The mode accuracy of distinguishing wake/REM/NREM and wake/REM/N1-2/SWS , was 84.7% and 80.1% respectively based on channel Fp2-M1, which located in forehead skin. The AHI calculated based on total sleep time derived from the model and gold standard were 13.6[4.30,42.5] and 14.2[4.8,42.7], respectively (Z=-2.477, P=0.013), and the kappa coefficient was 0.977. Conclusions: The autonomic sleep staging via a deep neural network model based on forehead single-channel EEG (Fp2-M1) has a good consistency in the identification sleep stage in a population with habitual snoring and OSAHS with different categories. The AHI calculated based on this model has high consistency with manual scoring.\n\u76ee\u7684\uff1a \u63a2\u8ba8\u5728\u5934\u90e8\u4e0d\u540c\u4f4d\u7f6e\u91c7\u96c6\u7684\u5355\u5bfc\u8054\u8111\u7535\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u5206\u56fe\u6a21\u578b\u5224\u522b\u5355\u7eaf\u6253\u9f3e\u53ca\u963b\u585e\u6027\u7761\u7720\u547c\u5438\u6682\u505c\u4f4e\u901a\u6c14\u7efc\u5408\u5f81\uff08OSAHS\uff09\u60a3\u8005\u7761\u7720\u5206\u671f\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002 \u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a \u56de\u987e\u6027\u5206\u67902020\u5e749\u6708\u81f32021\u5e743\u6708\u56e0\u6253\u9f3e\u3001\u547c\u5438\u6682\u505c\u3001\u767d\u5929\u55dc\u7761\u7b49\u75c7\u72b6\u5c31\u8bca\u4e8e\u5317\u4eac\u540c\u4ec1\u533b\u9662\u7761\u7720\u533b\u5b66\u4e2d\u5fc3\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u5bfc\u7761\u7720\u76d1\u6d4b\u7684114\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u8c61\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u753793\u4f8b\uff0c\u597321\u4f8b\uff0c\u5e74\u9f8420~64\u5c81\uff0c\u4e2d\u4f4d\u6570\u4e3a38.0\uff3b31.8\uff0c48.3\uff3d\u5c81\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u8c61\u4e2dOSAHS\u60a3\u800585\u4f8b\uff0c\u5355\u7eaf\u6253\u9f3e\u7ec429\u4f8b\u3002\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u91c7\u96c6\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684\u5934\u90e8\u5355\u5bfc\u8054\u8111\u7535\u4fe1\u53f7\uff08Fp2-M1\uff0cC4-M1\uff0cF3-M2\uff0cREOG-M1\uff0cO1-M2\uff09\u5e94\u7528\u4ee5\u5f80\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5206\u56fe\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u7761\u7720\u5206\u671f\u5224\u8bfb\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4ee5\u591a\u5bfc\u7761\u7720\u76d1\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u91d1\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5224\u8bfb\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u7387\u53ca\u4e0d\u540c\u75c5\u60c5\u4e25\u91cd\u7a0b\u5ea6\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u5e94\u7528SPSS 22.0\u7edf\u8ba1\u8f6f\u4ef6\u8fdb\u884c\u8d44\u6599\u5e93\u5efa\u7acb\u53ca\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u5206\u6790\u3002 \u7ed3\u679c\uff1a \u5171\u5224\u8bfb\u7761\u7720\u5206\u671f124 747\u5e27\u3002Fp2-M1\u3001C4-M1\u3001F3-M2\u3001REOG-M1\u3001O1-M2\u5bfc\u8054\u533a\u5206\u7761\u7720\u6216\u6e05\u9192\u671f\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5206\u522b\u4e3a92.3%\u300192.6%\u300193.5%\u300189.2%\u548c83.0%\u3002\u4f4d\u4e8e\u989d\u90e8\u76ae\u80a4\u7684Fp2-M1\u5355\u5bfc\u8054\u6a21\u578b\u5224\u65ad\u6e05\u9192\u3001\u5feb\u52a8\u773c\u7761\u7720\u6216\u975e\u5feb\u52a8\u773c\u7761\u7720\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e3a84.7%\uff1b\u5224\u65ad\u6e05\u9192\u3001\u5feb\u52a8\u773c\u7761\u7720\u3001\u975e\u5feb\u52a8\u773c\u7761\u77201~2\u671f\u3001\u6162\u6ce2\u7761\u7720\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u4e00\u81f4\u602780.1%\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u7761\u7720\u5206\u671f\u548c\u91d1\u6807\u51c6\u7761\u7720\u5206\u671f\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684AHI\u4e2d\u4f4d\u6570\u5206\u522b\u4e3a13.6\uff3b4.3\uff0c42.5\uff3d\u548c14.2\uff3b4.8\uff0c42.7\uff3d\uff0cZ=-2.477\uff0cP=0.013\uff0c\u8bca\u65adOSAHS\u4e00\u81f4\u6027Kappa\u7cfb\u6570\u4e3a0.977\u3002 \u7ed3\u8bba\uff1a Fp2-M1\u5355\u5bfc\u8054\u8111\u7535\u4fe1\u53f7\u7ed3\u5408\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u6253\u9f3e\u53ca\u4e0d\u540c\u4e25\u91cd\u5ea6\u7684OSAHS\u60a3\u8005\u7684\u7761\u7720\u5206\u671f\u5224\u65ad\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u826f\u597d\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684AHI\u5728\u8bca\u65adOSAHS\u4e0e\u91d1\u6807\u51c6\u5177\u6709\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002.", "Fault diagnosis and classification for machines are integral to condition monitoring in the industrial sector. However, in recent times, as sensor technology and artificial intelligence have developed, data-driven fault diagnosis and classification have been more widely investigated. The data-driven approach requires good-quality features to attain good fault classification accuracy, yet domain expertise and a fair amount of labeled data are important for better features. This paper proposes a deep auto-encoder (DAE) and convolutional neural network (CNN)-based bearing fault classification model using motor current signals of an induction motor (IM). Motor current signals can be easily and non-invasively collected from the motor. However, the current signal collected from industrial sources is highly contaminated with noise; feature calculation thus becomes very challenging. The DAE is utilized for estimating the nonlinear function of the system with the normal state data, and later, the residual signal is obtained. The subsequent CNN model then successfully classified the types of faults from the residual signals. Our proposed semi-supervised approach achieved very high classification accuracy (more than 99%). The inclusion of DAE was found to not only improve the accuracy significantly but also to be potentially useful when the amount of labeled data is small. The experimental outcomes are compared with some existing works on the same dataset, and the performance of this proposed combined approach is found to be comparable with them. In terms of the classification accuracy and other evaluation parameters, the overall method can be considered as an effective approach for bearing fault classification using the motor current signal.", "In a progressively interconnected world where the Internet of Things (IoT), ubiquitous computing, and artificial intelligence are leading to groundbreaking technology, cybersecurity remains an underdeveloped aspect. This is particularly alarming for brain-to-computer interfaces (BCIs), where hackers can threaten the user's physical and psychological safety. In fact, standard algorithms currently employed in BCI systems are inadequate to deal with cyberattacks. In this paper, we propose a solution to improve the cybersecurity of BCI systems. As a case study, we focus on P300-based BCI systems using support vector machine (SVM) algorithms and EEG data. First, we verified that SVM algorithms are incapable of identifying hacking by simulating a set of cyberattacks using fake P300 signals and noise-based attacks. This was achieved by comparing the performance of several models when validated using real and hacked P300 datasets. Then, we implemented our solution to improve the cybersecurity of the system. The proposed solution is based on an EEG channel mixing approach to identify anomalies in the transmission channel due to hacking. Our study demonstrates that the proposed architecture can successfully identify 99.996% of simulated cyberattacks, implementing a dedicated counteraction that preserves most of BCI functions.", "In a changing climate where future food security is a growing concern, researchers are exploring new methods and technologies in the effort to meet ambitious crop yield targets. The application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) including Machine Learning (ML) methods in this area has been proposed as a potential mechanism to support this. This review explores current research in the area to convey the state-of-the-art as to how AI/ML have been used to advance research, gain insights, and generally enable progress in this area. We address the question-Can AI improve crops and plant health? We further discriminate the bluster from the lustre by identifying the key challenges that AI has been shown to address, balanced with the potential issues with its usage, and the key requisites for its success. Overall, we hope to raise awareness and, as a result, promote usage, of AI related approaches where they can have appropriate impact to improve practices in agricultural and plant sciences.", "Anxiety disorders are the most common group of mental disorders. There is mounting evidence demonstrating the importance of nutrition in the development and progression of mental disorders such as depression; however, less is known about the role of nutrition in anxiety disorders. This scoping review sought to systematically map the existing literature on anxiety disorders and nutrition in order to identify associations between dietary factors and anxiety symptoms or disorder prevalence as well as identify gaps and opportunities for further research. The review followed established methodological approaches for scoping reviews. Due to the large volume of results, an online program (Abstrackr) with artificial intelligence features was used. Studies reporting an association between a dietary constituent and anxiety symptoms or disorders were counted and presented in figures. A total of 55,914 unique results were identified. After a full-text review, 1541 articles met criteria for inclusion. Analysis revealed an association between less anxiety and more fruits and vegetables, omega-3 fatty acids, \"healthy\" dietary patterns, caloric restriction, breakfast consumption, ketogenic diet, broad-spectrum micronutrient supplementation, zinc, magnesium and selenium, probiotics, and a range of phytochemicals. Analysis revealed an association between higher levels of anxiety and high-fat diet, inadequate tryptophan and dietary protein, high intake of sugar and refined carbohydrates, and \"unhealthy\" dietary patterns. Results are limited by a large percentage of animal and observational studies. Only 10% of intervention studies involved participants with anxiety disorders, limiting the applicability of the findings. High quality intervention studies involving participants with anxiety disorders are warranted.", "Early metabolic reorganization was only recently recognized as an essentially integrated part of immunology. In this context, unbalanced ROS/RNS levels connected to increased aerobic fermentation, which is linked to alpha-tubulin-based cell restructuring and control of cell cycle progression, were identified as a major complex trait for early de novo programming ('CoV-MAC-TED') during SARS-CoV-2 infection. This trait was highlighted as a critical target for developing early anti-viral/anti-SARS-CoV-2 strategies. To obtain this result, analyses had been performed on transcriptome data from diverse experimental cell systems. A call was released for wide data collection of the defined set of genes for transcriptome analyses, named 'ReprogVirus', which should be based on strictly standardized protocols and data entry from diverse virus types and variants into the 'ReprogVirus Platform'. This platform is currently under development. However, so far, an in vitro cell system from primary target cells for virus attacks that could ideally serve for standardizing the data collection of early SARS-CoV-2 infection responses has not been defined.\nHere, we demonstrate transcriptome-level profiles of the most critical 'ReprogVirus' gene sets for identifying 'CoV-MAC-TED' in cultured human nasal epithelial cells infected by two SARS-CoV-2 variants differing in disease severity. Our results (a) validate 'Cov-MAC-TED' as a crucial trait for early SARS-CoV-2 reprogramming for the tested virus variants and (b) demonstrate its relevance in cultured human nasal epithelial cells.\nIn vitro-cultured human nasal epithelial cells proved to be appropriate for standardized transcriptome data collection in the 'ReprogVirus Platform'. Thus, this cell system is highly promising to advance integrative data analyses with the help of artificial intelligence methodologies for designing anti-SARS-CoV-2 strategies.", "Artificial Intelligence (AI) performs human intelligence-dependant tasks using tools such as Machine Learning, and its subtype Deep Learning. AI has incorporated itself in the field of cardiovascular medicine, and increasingly employed to revolutionize diagnosis, treatment, risk prediction, clinical care, and drug discovery. Heart failure has a high prevalence, and mortality rate following hospitalization being 10.4% at 30-days, 22% at 1-year, and 42.3% at 5-years. Early detection of heart failure is of vital importance in shaping the medical, and surgical interventions specific to HF patients. This has been accomplished with the advent of Neural Network (NN) model, the accuracy of which has proven to be 85%. AI can be of tremendous help in analyzing raw image data from cardiac imaging techniques (such as echocardiography, computed tomography, cardiac MRI amongst others) and electrocardiogram recordings through incorporation of an algorithm. The use of decision trees by Rough Sets (RS), and logistic regression (LR) methods utilized to construct decision-making model to diagnose congestive heart failure, and role of AI in early detection of future mortality and destabilization episodes has played a vital role in optimizing cardiovascular disease outcomes. The review highlights the major achievements of AI in recent years that has radically changed nearly all areas of HF prevention, diagnosis, and management.", "The development of artificial intelligence and the Internet of things has motivated extensive research on self-powered flexible sensors. The conventional sensor must be powered by a battery device, while innovative self-powered sensors can provide power for the sensing device. Self-powered flexible sensors can have higher mobility, wider distribution, and even wireless operation, while solving the problem of the limited life of the battery so that it can be continuously operated and widely utilized. In recent years, the studies on piezoelectric nanogenerators (PENGs) and triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) have mainly concentrated on self-powered flexible sensors. Self-powered flexible sensors based on PENGs and TENGs have been reported as sensing devices in many application fields, such as human health monitoring, environmental monitoring, wearable devices, electronic skin, human-machine interfaces, robots, and intelligent transportation and cities. This review summarizes the development process of the sensor in terms of material design and structural optimization, as well as introduces its frontier applications in related fields. We also look forward to the development prospects and future of self-powered flexible sensors.", "Inspired by the formation of random sparkling microcrystallines in naturally precious opals, we develop a new strategy to produce a class of unclonable photonic crystal hydrogels (UPCHs) induced by the electrostatic interaction effect, which further achieve unclonable encoding/decoding and random high-encrypted patterns along with an ultrahigh and controllable encoding capacity up to ca. 2 \u00d7 10166055. Owing to the randomness of colloidal crystals in the self-assembly process, UPCHs with randomly distributed sparkling spots are endowed with unpredictable/unrepeatable characteristics. This, coupled with the water response of UPCHs with angle dependence and robustness, can upgrade the encryption level and address some limitations of easy fading, limited durability, and high cost in practical uses of existing unclonable materials. Interestingly, UPCHs can be readily patterned to exhibit reliable and rapid authentication by utilizing artificial intelligence (AI) deep learning, which can find broad applications in developing unbreakable and portable information storage/steganography systems not limited to anticounterfeiting.", "Computed tomography (CT) is an auxiliary modality in the diagnosis of the novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) disease and can guide physicians in the presence of lung involvement. In this study, we aimed to investigate the contribution of deep learning to diagnosis in patients with typical COVID-19 pneumonia findings on CT.\nThis study retrospectively evaluated 690 lesions obtained from 35 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia based on typical findings on non-contrast high-resolution CT (HRCT) in our hospital. The diagnoses of the patients were also confirmed by other necessary tests. HRCT images were assessed in the parenchymal window. In the images obtained, COVID-19 lesions were detected. For the deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) algorithm, the Confusion matrix was used based on a Tensorflow Framework in Python.\nA total of 596 labeled lesions obtained from 224 sections of the images were used for the training of the algorithm, 89 labeled lesions from 27 sections were used in validation, and 67 labeled lesions from 25 images in testing. Fifty-six of the 67 lesions used in the testing stage were accurately detected by the algorithm while the remaining 11 were not recognized. There was no false positive. The Recall, Precision and F1 score values in the test group were 83.58, 1, and 91.06, respectively.\nWe successfully detected the COVID-19 pneumonia lesions on CT images using the algorithms created with artificial intelligence. The integration of deep learning into the diagnostic stage in medicine is an important step for the diagnosis of diseases that can cause lung involvement in possible future pandemics.", "Dislocation is the most common reason for early revision following total hip arthroplasty (THA). More than 40 years ago, Lewinnek et al. proposed an acetabular \"safe zone\" to avoid dislocation. While novel at the time, their study was substantially limited according to modern standards. The purpose of this study was to determine optimal acetabular cup positioning during THA as well as the effect of surgical approach on the topography of the acetabular safe zone and the hazard of dislocation.\nPrimary THAs that had been performed at a single institution from 2000 to 2017 were reviewed. Acetabular inclination and anteversion were measured using an artificial intelligence neural network; they were validated with performance testing and comparison with blinded grading by 2 orthopaedic surgeons. Patient demographics and dislocation were noted during follow-up. Multivariable Cox proportional-hazards regression, including multidimensional analysis, was performed to define the 3D topography of the acetabular safe zone and its association with surgical approach.\nWe followed 9,907 THAs in 8,081 patients (4,166 women and 3,915 men; 64 \u00b1 13 years of age) for a mean of 5 \u00b1 3 years (range: 2 to 16); 316 hips (3%) sustained a dislocation during follow-up. The mean acetabular inclination was 44\u00b0 \u00b1 7\u00b0 and the mean anteversion was 32\u00b0 \u00b1 9\u00b0. Patients who did not sustain a dislocation had a mean anteversion of 32\u00b0 \u00b1 9\u00b0 (median, 32\u00b0), with the historic ideal anteversion of 15\u00b0 observed to be only in the third percentile among non-dislocating THAs (p < 0.001). Multivariable modeling demonstrated the lowest dislocation hazards at an inclination of 37\u00b0 and an anteversion of 27\u00b0, with an ideal modern safe zone of 27\u00b0 to 47\u00b0 of inclination and 18\u00b0 to 38\u00b0 of anteversion. Three-dimensional analysis demonstrated a similar safe-zone location but significantly different safe-zone topography among surgical approaches (p = 0.03) and sexes (p = 0.02).\nOptimal acetabular positioning differs significantly from historic values, with increased anteversion providing decreased dislocation risk. Additionally, surgical approach and patient sex demonstrated clear effects on 3D safe-zone topography. Further study is needed to characterize the 3D interaction between acetabular positioning and spinopelvic as well as femoral-sided parameters.\nPrognostic Level III. See Instructions for Authors for a complete description of levels of evidence.", "Artificial Intelligence chatbots allow interactive dialogue-driven teaching of medical sciences. Open-source tools allow educators to adapt existing technology to create intelligent learning systems. We utilised an open-source machine learning architecture and fine-tuned it with a customised database to train an AI dialogue system to teach medical students anatomy.", "Generation Z is a data-driven generation. Everyone has the entirety of humanity's knowledge in their hands. The technological possibilities are endless. However, we use and misuse this blessing to face swap using deepfake. Deepfake is an emerging subdomain of artificial intelligence technology in which one person's face is overlaid over another person's face, which is very prominent across social media. Machine learning is the main element of deepfakes, and it has allowed deepfake images and videos to be generated considerably faster and at a lower cost. Despite the negative connotations associated with the phrase \"deepfakes,\" the technology is being more widely employed commercially and individually. Although it is relatively new, the latest technological advances make it more and more challenging to detect deepfakes and synthesized images from real ones. An increasing sense of unease has developed around the emergence of deepfake technologies. Our main objective is to detect deepfake images from real ones accurately. In this research, we implemented several methods to detect deepfake images and make a comparative analysis. Our model was trained by datasets from Kaggle, which had 70,000 images from the Flickr dataset and 70,000 images produced by styleGAN. For this comparative study of the use of convolutional neural networks (CNN) to identify genuine and deepfake pictures, we trained eight different CNN models. Three of these models were trained using the DenseNet architecture (DenseNet121, DenseNet169, and DenseNet201); two were trained using the VGGNet architecture (VGG16, VGG19); one was with the ResNet50 architecture, one with the VGGFace, and one with a bespoke CNN architecture. We have also implemented a custom model that incorporates methods like dropout and padding that aid in determining whether or not the other models reflect their objectives. The results were categorized by five evaluation metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and area under the ROC (receiver operating characteristic) curve. Amongst all the models, VGGFace performed the best, with 99% accuracy. Besides, we obtained 97% from the ResNet50, 96% from the DenseNet201, 95% from the DenseNet169, 94% from the VGG19, 92% from the VGG16, 97% from the DenseNet121 model, and 90% from the custom model.", "The Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) pandemic has reshaped clinical chronic disease management. Patients reduced the number of physical clinic visits for regular follow-up care because of the pandemic. However, in developing countries, the scattered healthcare system hindered accessibility to clinical consultation, and poorly controlled chronic diseases resulted in numerous complications. Furthermore, the longer patients suffered from the chronic disease being treated, the more physical and psychological stress they experienced. \"Diabetes Burnout,\" as an example, is a term to describe the phenomenon of psychological reluctance in long-term glycemic control. A comprehensive, patient-centered, and automatic drug administration and delivery model may reduce patient stress and increase compliance. Potential next-generation medication platforms, consisting of internal regulation and external interaction, may conduct autonomous dose adjustment and continuous selfmonitoring with the assistance of artificial intelligence, telemedicine, and wireless technologies. Internal regulation forms a closed-loop system in which drug administration is optimized in an implanted drug-releasing device according to a patient's physiopathological response. The other feature, external interaction, creates an ecosystem among patients, healthcare providers, and pharmaceutical researchers to monitor and adjust post-market therapeutic efficacy and safety. These platforms may provide a solution for self-medication and self-care for a wide variety of patients but may be life-changing for patients who live in developing countries where the healthcare system is scattered, as they could effectively remove healthcare barriers. As the technology matures, these self-administrated platforms may become more available and increasingly affordable, offering considerable impact to health and wellness efforts worldwide.", "Human operators have the trend of increasing physical and mental workloads when performing teleoperation tasks in uncertain and dynamic environments. In addition, their performances are influenced by subjective factors, potentially leading to operational errors or task failure. Although agent-based methods offer a promising solution to the above problems, the human experience and intelligence are necessary for teleoperation scenarios. In this paper, a truncated quantile critics reinforcement learning-based integrated framework is proposed for human-agent teleoperation that encompasses training, assessment and agent-based arbitration. The proposed framework allows for an expert training agent, a bilateral training and cooperation process to realize the co-optimization of agent and human. It can provide efficient and quantifiable training feedback. Experiments have been conducted to train subjects with the developed algorithm. The performances of human-human and human-agent cooperation modes are also compared. The results have shown that subjects can complete the tasks of reaching and picking and placing with the assistance of an agent in a shorter operational time, with a higher success rate and less workload than human-human cooperation.", "Malnutrition is common, especially among older, hospitalised patients, and is associated with higher mortality, longer hospitalisation stays, infections, and loss of muscle mass. It is therefore of utmost importance to employ a proper method for dietary assessment that can be used for the identification and management of malnourished hospitalised patients. In this study, we propose an automated Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based system that receives input images of the meals before and after their consumption and is able to estimate the patient's energy, carbohydrate, protein, fat, and fatty acids intake. The system jointly segments the images into the different food components and plate types, estimates the volume of each component before and after consumption, and calculates the energy and macronutrient intake for every meal, based on the kitchen's menu database. Data acquired from an acute geriatric hospital as well as from our previous study were used for the fine-tuning and evaluation of the system. The results from both our system and the hospital's standard procedure were compared to the estimations of experts. Agreement was better with the system, suggesting that it has the potential to replace standard clinical procedures with a positive impact on time spent directly with the patients.", "Mobile health (mHealth) technologies, such as symptom tracking apps, are crucial for coping with the global pandemic crisis by providing near real-time, in situ information for the medical and governmental response. However, in such a dynamic and diverse environment, methods are still needed to support public health decision-making. This paper uses the lens of strong structuration theory to investigate networks of COVID-19 symptoms in the Belfast metropolitan area. A self-supervised machine learning method measuring information entropy was applied to the Northern Ireland COVIDCare app. The findings reveal: (1) relevant stratifications of disease symptoms, (2) particularities in health-wealth networks, and (3) the predictive potential of artificial intelligence to extract entangled knowledge from data in COVID-related apps. The proposed method proved to be effective for near real-time in-situ analysis of COVID-19 progression and to focus and complement public health decisions. Our contribution is relevant to an understanding of SARS-COV-2 symptom entanglements in localised environments. It can assist decision-makers in designing both reactive and proactive health measures that should be personalised to the heterogeneous needs of different populations. Moreover, near real-time assessment of pandemic symptoms using digital technologies will be critical to create early warning systems of emerging SARS-CoV-2 strains and predict the need for healthcare resources.", "Heart disease is a leading cause of death among cats and dogs. Vertebral heart scale (VHS) is one tool to quantify radiographic cardiac enlargement and to predict the occurrence of congestive heart failure. The aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of artificial intelligence (AI) performing VHS measurements when compared with two board-certified specialists. Ground truth consisted of the average of constituent VHS measurements performed by board-certified specialists. Thirty canine and 30 feline thoracic lateral radiographs were evaluated by each operator, using two different methods for determination of the cardiac short axis on dogs' radiographs: the original approach published by Buchanan and the modified approach proposed by the EPIC trial authors, and only Buchanan's method for cats' radiographs. Overall, the VHS calculated by the AI, radiologist, and cardiologist had a high degree of agreement in both canine and feline patients (intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) = 0.998). In canine patients, when comparing methods used to calculate VHS by specialists, there was also a high degree of agreement (ICC = 0.999). When evaluating specifically the results of the AI VHS vs. the two specialists' readings, the agreement was excellent for both canine (ICC = 0.998) and feline radiographs (ICC = 0.998). Performance of AI trained to locate VHS reference points agreed with manual calculation by specialists in both cats and dogs. Such a computer-aided technique might be an important asset for veterinarians in general practice to limit interobserver variability and obtain more comparable VHS reading over time.", "Research in molecular sciences witnessed the rise and fall of Artificial Intelligence (AI)/ Machine Learning (ML) methods, especially artificial neural networks, few decades ago. However, we see a major resurgence in the use of modern ML methods in scientific research during the last few years. These methods have had phenomenal success in the areas of computer vision, speech recognition, natural language processing (NLP), etc. This has inspired chemists and biologists to apply these algorithms to problems in natural sciences. Availability of high performance Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) accelerators, large datasets, new algorithms, and libraries has enabled this surge. ML algorithms have successfully been applied to various domains in molecular sciences by providing much faster and sometimes more accurate solutions compared to traditional methods like Quantum Mechanical (QM) calculations, Density Functional Theory (DFT) or Molecular Mechanics (MM) based methods, etc. Some of the areas where the potential of ML methods are shown to be effective are in drug design, prediction of high-level quantum mechanical energies, molecular design, molecular dynamics materials, and retrosynthesis of organic compounds, etc. This article intends to conceptually introduce various modern ML methods and their relevance and applications in computational natural sciences. Synopsis Recent surge in the application of machine learning (ML) methods in fundamental sciences has led to a perspective that these methods may become important tools in chemical science. This perspective provides an overview of the modern ML methods and their successful applications in chemistry during the last few years.", "High-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy (BT) is an effective cancer treatment method in which the radiation source is placed within the body. Treatment planning is a critical component for a successful outcome. Almost all currently proposed treatment planning methods are built on stochastic heuristic algorithms, which limits the generation of higher quality plans. This study proposed a novel treatment planning method to adjust dwell times in a human-like fashion to improve the quality of the plan.\nWe built an intelligent treatment planner network (ITPN) based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL). The network architecture of ITPN is Dueling Double-Deep Q Network. The state is the dwell time of each dwell position and the action is which dwell time to adjust and how to adjust it. A hybrid equivalent uniform dose objective function was established and assigned corresponding rewards according to its changes. Experience replay was performed with the epsilon greedy algorithm and SumTree data structure.\nIn the evaluation of ITPN using 20 patient cases, D90, D100 and V100 showed no significant difference compared with inverse planning simulated annealing (IPSA) optimization. However, D2cc of bladder, rectum and sigmoid, V150 and V200 were significant reduced, and homogeneity index and conformity index were significantly increased.\nThe proposed ITPN was able to generate higher quality plans based on the learned dwell time adjustment policy than IPSA. This is the first artificial intelligence system that can directly determine the dwell times of HDR BT, which demonstrated the potential feasibility of solving optimization problems via DRL.", "Proteins interact through their interfaces to fulfill essential functions in the cell. They bind to their partners in a highly specific manner and form complexes that have a profound effect on understanding the biological pathways they are involved in. Any abnormal interactions may cause diseases. Therefore, the identification of small molecules which modulate protein interactions through their interfaces has high therapeutic potential. However, discovering such molecules is challenging. Most protein-protein binding affinity is attributed to a small set of amino acids found in protein interfaces known as hot spots. Recent studies demonstrate that drug-like small molecules specifically may bind to hot spots. Therefore, hot spot prediction is crucial. As experimental data accumulates, artificial intelligence begins to be used for computational hot spot prediction. First, we review machine learning and deep learning for computational hot spot prediction and then explain the significance of hot spots toward\u00a0drug design.", "In the last two decades, artificial intelligence (AI) has transformed the way in which we consume and analyse sports. The role of AI in improving decision-making and forecasting in sports, amongst many other advantages, is rapidly expanding and gaining more attention in both the academic sector and the industry. Nonetheless, for many sports audiences, professionals and policy makers, who are not particularly au courant or experts in AI, the connexion between artificial intelligence and sports remains fuzzy. Likewise, for many, the motivations for adopting a machine learning (ML) paradigm in sports analytics are still either faint or unclear. In this perspective paper, we present a high-level, non-technical, overview of the machine learning paradigm that motivates its potential for enhancing sports (performance and business) analytics. We provide a summary of some relevant research literature on the areas in which artificial intelligence and machine learning have been applied to the sports industry and in sport research. Finally, we present some hypothetical scenarios of how AI and ML could shape the future of sports.", "Artificial intelligence (AI)-based protein structure databases are expected to have an impact on drug discovery. Here, we show how AlphaFold could support rare diseases research programs. We focus on Alsin, a protein responsible for rare motor neuron diseases, such as infantile-onset ascending hereditary spastic paralysis (IAHSP) and juvenile primary lateral sclerosis (JPLS), and involved in some cases of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). First, we compared the AlphaFoldDB human Alsin model with homology models of Alsin domains. We then evaluated the flexibility profile of Alsin and of experimentally characterized mutants present in patients with IAHSP. Next, we compared preliminary models of dimeric/tetrameric Alsin responsible for its physiological action with hypothetical models reported in the literature. Finally, we suggest the best animal model for drug candidates testing. Overall, we computationally show that drug discovery efforts toward Alsin-involving diseases should be pursued.", "Artificial intelligence (AI)-based drug design has great promise to fundamentally change the landscape of the pharmaceutical industry. Even though there are great progress from handcrafted feature-based machine learning models, 3D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and graph neural networks, effective and efficient representations that characterize the structural, physical, chemical and biological properties of molecular structures and interactions remain to be a great challenge. Here, we propose an equal-sized molecular 2D image representation, known as the molecular persistent spectral image (Mol-PSI), and combine it with CNN model for AI-based drug design. Mol-PSI provides a unique one-to-one image representation for molecular structures and interactions. In general, deep models are empowered to achieve better performance with systematically organized representations in image format. A well-designed parallel CNN architecture for adapting Mol-PSIs is developed for protein-ligand binding affinity prediction. Our results, for the three most commonly used databases, including PDBbind-v2007, PDBbind-v2013 and PDBbind-v2016, are better than all traditional machine learning models, as far as we know. Our Mol-PSI model provides a powerful molecular representation that can be widely used in AI-based drug design and molecular data analysis.", "Driver mutations promote initiation and progression of cancer. Pharmacological treatment can inhibit the action of the mutant protein; however, drug resistance almost invariably emerges. Multiple studies revealed that cancer drug resistance is based upon a plethora of distinct mechanisms. Drug resistance mutations can occur in the same protein or in different proteins; as well as in the same pathway or in parallel pathways, bypassing the intercepted signaling. The dilemma that the clinical oncologist is facing is that not all the genomic alterations as well as alterations in the tumor microenvironment that facilitate cancer cell proliferation are known, and neither are the alterations that are likely to promote metastasis. For example, the common KRasG12C driver mutation emerges in different cancers. Most occur in NSCLC, but some occur, albeit to a lower extent, in colorectal cancer and pancreatic ductal carcinoma. The responses to KRasG12C inhibitors are variable and fall into three categories, (i) new point mutations in KRas, or multiple copies of KRAS G12C which lead to higher expression level of the mutant protein; (ii) mutations in genes other than KRAS; (iii) original cancer transitioning to other cancer(s). Resistance to adagrasib, an experimental antitumor agent exerting its cytotoxic effect as a covalent inhibitor of the G12C KRas, indicated that half of the cases present multiple KRas mutations as well as allele amplification. Redundant or parallel pathways included MET amplification; emerging driver mutations in NRAS, BRAF, MAP2K1, and RET; gene fusion events in ALK, RET, BRAF, RAF1, and FGFR3; and loss-of-function mutations in NF1 and PTEN tumor suppressors. In the current review we discuss the molecular mechanisms underlying drug resistance while focusing on those emerging to common targeted cancer drivers. We also address questions of why cancers with a common driver mutation are unlikely to evolve a common drug resistance mechanism, and whether one can predict the likely mechanisms that the tumor cell may develop. These vastly important and tantalizing questions in drug discovery, and broadly in precision medicine, are the focus of our present review. We end with our perspective, which calls for target combinations to be selected and prioritized with the help of the emerging massive compute power which enables artificial intelligence, and the increased gathering of data to overcome its insatiable needs.", "Severe mitral regurgitation (MR) is a cardiac disease that can lead to fatal consequences. MitraClip (MC) intervention is a percutaneous procedure whereby the mitral valve (MV) leaflets are connected along the edge using MCs. The outcomes of the MC intervention are not known in advance, i.e., the outcomes are quite variable. Artificial intelligence (AI) can be used to guide the cardiologist in selecting optimal MC scenarios. In this study, we describe an atlas of shapes as well as different scenarios for MC implantation for such an AI analysis. We generated the MV geometrical data from three different sources. First, the patients' 3-dimensional echo images were used. The pixel data from six key points were obtained from three views of the echo images. Using PyGem, an open-source morphing library in Python, these coordinates were used to create the geometry by morphing a template geometry. Second, the dimensions of the MV, from the literature were used to create data. Third, we used machine learning methods, principal component analysis, and generative adversarial networks to generate more shapes. We used the finite element (FE) software ABAQUS to simulate smoothed particle hydrodynamics in different scenarios for MC intervention. The MR and stresses in the leaflets were post-processed. Our physics-based FE models simulated the outcomes of MC intervention for different scenarios. The MR and stresses in the leaflets were computed by the FE models for a single clip at different locations as well as two and three clips. Results from FE simulations showed that the location and number of MCs affect subsequent residual MR, and that leaflet stresses do not follow a simple pattern. Furthermore, FE models need several hours to provide the results, and they are not applicable for clinical usage where the predicted outcomes of MC therapy are needed in real-time. In this study, we generated the required dataset for the AI models which can provide the results in a matter of seconds.", "Background: Social communication (SC) includes the use and interpretation of verbal and non-verbal messages within a social context and thus requires more than knowledge of language. Social communication skills are essential for connecting and engaging with others, and SC deficits are often associated with emotional and behavioral problems. There is a lack of feasible instruments for assessing SC skills in individuals with intellectual disability (ID). Methods: A questionnaire on social communication in adults with ID (QSC-ID) comprising 20 Likert-scaled items was developed and completed on behalf of participants (n = 52) from three Austrian therapeutic living communities for people with ID and deafness by their living- and working-facility key caregivers. The sample of adults with hearing loss was considered ideal for the development of a measure of SC that is not restricted to a specific communication mode or overly related with language skills. Results: The preliminary results showed high construct validity. Correlations were high between SC and language, social skills, and severity of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), moderate between SC and adaptive skills, and non-verbal intelligence and, as expected, low between SC and motor skills. Interrater reliability was found to be good or at least acceptable for all items. Total raw scores were well-distributed over the whole range-Cut-offs based on the 10th and 20th percentile are suggested to identify atypical and borderline SC skills. Caregiver feedback and completeness of data suggest that the questionnaire is highly feasible. Conclusion: Questionnaire on social communication in adults with ID is an easy-to-use caregiver-reported questionnaire for use with individuals with mild to severe forms of ID. Initial testing of validity looks promising. Further validation in populations with typical hearing is required. Due to substantial correlations between SC and structural language skills the calculation of specific SC cut-offs for different levels of linguistic skills should be considered when sufficient data is available.", "The rise of FinTech has been meteoric in China. Investing in mutual funds through robo-advisor has become a new innovation in the wealth management industry. In recent years, machine learning, especially deep learning, has been widely used in the financial industry to solve financial problems. This paper aims to improve the accuracy and timeliness of fund classification through the use of machine learning algorithms, that is, Gaussian hybrid clustering algorithm. At the same time, a deep learning-based prediction model is implemented to predict the price movement of fund classes based on the classification results. Fund classification carried out using 3,625 Chinese mutual funds shows both accurate and efficient results. The cluster-based spatiotemporal ensemble deep learning module shows better prediction accuracy than baseline models with only access to limited data samples. The main contribution of this paper is to provide a new approach to fund classification and price movement prediction to support the decision-making of the next generation robo-advisor assisted by artificial intelligence.", "India reported a severe public health challenge not only due to the COVID-19 outbreak but also the increasing number of associated mucormycosis cases since 2021.This study aimed at developing artificial intelligence based models to predict the risk of mucormycosis among the patients at the time of discharge from hospital.\nThe dataset included of 1229 COVID-19 positive patients, and additional 214 inpatients, COVID-19 positive as well as infected with mucormycosis. We used logistic regression, decision tree and random forest and the extreme gradient boosting algorithm. All our models were evaluated with 5-fold validation to derive a reliable estimate of the model error.\nThe logistic regression, XGBoost and random forest performed equally well with AUROC 95.0, 94.0, and 94.0 respectively. The best accuracy and precision (PPV) were 0.91\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.026 and 0.67\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.0526, respectively achieved by XGBoost, followed by logistic regression. This study also determined top five variables namely obesity, anosmia, de novo diabetes, myalgia, and nasal discharge, which showed positive impact towards the risk of mucormycosis.\nThe developed model has the potential to predict the patients at high risk and thus, consequently initiating preventive care or aiding in early detection of mucormycosis infection. Thus, this study, holds potential for early treatment and better management of patients suffering from COVID-19 associated mucormycosis.", "Developing artificial intelligence (AI) agents is challenging for efficient exploration in visually rich and complex environments. In this study, we formulate the exploration question as a reinforcement learning problem and rely on intrinsic motivation to guide exploration behavior. Such intrinsic motivation is driven by curiosity and is calculated based on episode memory. To distribute the intrinsic motivation, we use a count-based method and temporal distance to generate it synchronously. We tested our approach in 3D maze-like environments and validated its performance in exploration tasks through extensive experiments. The experimental results show that our agent can learn exploration ability from raw sensory input and accomplish autonomous exploration across different mazes. In addition, the learned policy is not biased by stochastic objects. We also analyze the effects of different training methods and driving forces on exploration policy.", "The rate of learning and cognitive development is at its highest level in preschool-aged children, making this stage a critical period. Exercise has received increasing attention for its beneficial physical and mental health effects on the development of preschool children. This study investigated the effects of diverse exercise on the cognition of preschool children. Two classes were randomly selected from kindergarten classes of children aged 5-6 years, and designated as the experimental and control classes. Each class contained 20 children (10 boys and 10 girls) according to the kindergarten class system. The experimental class completed exercises according to the designed curriculum, while control class carried out exercises according to the regular teaching plan, for a study period of 12 weeks. The Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence (WPPSI) and the Mental Health Questionnaire for Children were used to assess outcomes, both at the beginning and end of study. After 12 weeks, the experimental class has improved in the \"Object Assembly,\" \"Block Design,\" \"Picture Completion,\" and \"Coding\" (14.70 \u00b1 2.14, p < 0.01; 14.54 \u00b1 1.56, p < 0.01; 9.62 \u00b1 2.06, p < 0.05; 15.92 \u00b1 2.72, p < 0.05) in performance test, and showed improvements in the \"Movement,\" \"Cognitive Ability,\" \"Sociality\" and \"Living Habits\" (5.65 \u00b1 0.59, p < 0.01; 11.20 \u00b1 1.91, p < 0.05; 9.05 \u00b1 1.72, p < 0.05; 7.10 \u00b1 1.45, p < 0.05) in mental health outcomes. Diverse exercise has a significantly beneficial role in promoting the cognitive development of children aged 5-6 years, as well as a beneficial, albeit insignificant, role in their mental health.", "A group of surgeons and a medical educator constructed a curriculum to strengthen communication and emotional intelligence skills in the surgical setting.\nThe curriculum consisted of a small group discussion series occurring during medical students' eight-week surgery clerkship. The curriculum targeted the following objectives: building team rapport, exploring self-management strategies in team communication, recognizing communication styles, diagnosing conflict, identifying opportunities in professional and personal development, and discussing professionalism in medicine. Students completed pre-post Likert style tests about their knowledge and understanding of the above-mentioned topics.\nTexas A&M University College of Medicine, Surgical Clerkship at Baylor Scott and White Medical Center, a level 1 trauma center, in Temple, TX.\nTwenty-four students in their third year of medical school completed the communication curriculum.\nWilcoxon sign test was used to analyze the non-parametric data and multiple repeat tests required the significance level (p-Value) be adjusted to 0.003. Students showed significant increase in understanding of conflict management, their ability to communicate effectively, and their awareness of communication preferences (p < 0.001). In addition, they recognized better ways to engage with other students, residents, and staff on their rotation (p\u202f=\u202f0.002) and felt more confident in their ability to handle feedback (p\u202f=\u202f0.001). Open-ended responses on the post-test had overwhelmingly positive feedback with themes of awareness, psychological safety, and team rapport. Finally, students requested that the curriculum be taught longitudinally throughout their third-year clerkships.\nOur curriculum enabled students to improve their awareness of communication, conflict management, team dynamics, and professionalism. These important competencies will support students throughout their training and in their practice as future surgeons.", "To meet critical requirements on flexible electronic devices, multifunctionalized flexible sensors with excellent electromechanical performance and temperature perception are required. Herein, lignin-reinforced thermoresponsive poly(ionic liquid) hydrogel is prepared through an ultrasound-assisted synthesized method. Benefitting from the electrostatic interaction between lignin and ionic liquid, the hydrogel displays high stretchability (over 1425%), excellent toughness (over 132\u2009kPa), and impressive stress loading-unloading cyclic stability. The hydrogel strain sensor presents excellent electromechanical performance with a high gauge factor (1.37) and rapid response rate (198\u2009ms), which lays the foundation for human body movement detection and smart input. Moreover, owing to the thermal-sensitive feature of poly(ionic liquid), the as-prepared hydrogel displays remarkable thermal response sensitivity (0.217\u00b0C-1) in body temperature range and low limit of detection, which can be applied as a body shell temperature indicator. Particularly, the hydrogel can detect dual stimuli of strain and temperature and identify each signal individually, showing the specific application in human-machine interaction and artificial intelligence. By integrating the hydrogel strain sensor into a wireless sensation system, remote motion capture and gesture identification is realized in real-time.", "We hypothesize that artificial intelligence (AI) applied to relevant clinical testing in glaucoma has the potential to enhance the ability to detect glaucoma. This premise was discussed at the recent Collaborative Community on Ophthalmic Imaging meeting, \"The Future of Artificial Intelligence-Enabled Ophthalmic Image Interpretation: Accelerating Innovation and Implementation Pathways,\" held virtually September 3-4,\u00a02020. The Collaborative Community on Ophthalmic Imaging (CCOI) is an independent self-governing consortium of stakeholders with broad international representation from academic institutions, government agencies, and the private sector whose mission is to act as a forum for the purpose of helping speed innovation in healthcare technology. It was 1 of the first 2 such organizations officially designated by the Food and Drug Administration in September 2019 in response to their announcement of the collaborative community program as a strategic priority for 2018-2020. Further information on the CCOI can be found online at their website (https://www.cc-oi.org/about). Artificial intelligence for glaucoma diagnosis would have high utility globally, because access to care is limited in many parts of the world and half of all people with glaucoma are unaware of their illness. The application of AI technology to glaucoma diagnosis has the potential to broadly increase access to care worldwide, in essence flattening the Earth by providing expert-level evaluation to individuals even in the most remote regions of the planet.", "Driven by recent innovations and technological progress, the increasing quality and amount of biomedical data coupled with the advances in computing power allowed for much progress in artificial intelligence (AI) approaches for health and biomedical research. In interventional cardiology, the hope is for AI to provide automated analysis and deeper interpretation of data from electrocardiography, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and electronic health records, among others. Furthermore, high-performance predictive models supporting decision-making hold the potential to improve safety, diagnostic and prognostic prediction in patients undergoing interventional cardiology procedures. These applications include robotic-assisted percutaneous coronary intervention procedures and automatic assessment of coronary stenosis during diagnostic coronary angiograms. Machine learning (ML) has been used in these innovations that have improved the field of interventional cardiology, and more recently, deep Learning (DL) has emerged as one of the most successful branches of ML in many applications. It remains to be seen if DL approaches will have a major impact on current and future practice. DL-based predictive systems also have several limitations, including lack of interpretability and lack of generalizability due to cohort heterogeneity and low sample sizes. There are also challenges for the clinical implementation of these systems, such as ethical limits and data privacy. This review is intended to bring the attention of health practitioners and interventional cardiologists to the broad and helpful applications of ML and DL algorithms to date in the field. Their implementation challenges in daily practice and future applications in the field of interventional cardiology are also discussed.", "Limited access to assistive technology (AT) is a well-recognized global challenge. Emerging technologies have potential to develop new assistive products and bridge some of the gaps in access to AT. However, limited analyses exist on the potential of these technologies in the AT field. This paper describes a study that aimed to provide an overview of emerging technological developments and their potential for the AT field. It involved conducting a gray literature review and patent analysis to create an overview of the emerging enabling technologies that may foster the development of new AT products and services and identify emerging AT applications. The analysis identified seven enabling technologies that are relevant to the AT field. These are artificial intelligence, emerging human-computer interfaces, sensor technology, robotics, advances in connectivity and computing, additive manufacturing and new materials. Whilst there are over 3.7 million patents related to these enabling technologies, only a fraction of them - 11,000 patents were identified in the analysis specifically related to AT (0.3%). The paper presents some of the promising examples. Overall, the results indicate that there is an enormous potential for new AT solutions that capitalize on emerging technological advances.", "Bilateral breast cancer (BBC) is rare and is associated with an unfavorable prognosis. Consequently it is crucial to improve diagnostic performance of breast cancer in the clinical setting. We report a case of BBC in a 66-year-old woman and describe the imaging findings, including mammography, hand-held ultrasound, automated breast ultrasound, anatomical intelligence for breast ultrasound (AI-breast), and magnetic resonance imaging. Only AI-breast ultrasound successfully located the two tumors, while other imaging examinations failed to detect the tumor in the right breast.", "Dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) imaging is a non-invasive technique used for the evaluation of tissue vascularity features through imaging series acquisition after contrast medium administration. Over the years, the study technique and protocols have evolved, seeing a growing application of this method across different imaging modalities for the study of almost all body districts. The main and most consolidated current applications concern MRI imaging for the study of tumors, but an increasing number of studies are evaluating the use of this technique also for inflammatory pathologies and functional studies. Furthermore, the recent advent of artificial intelligence techniques is opening up a vast scenario for the analysis of quantitative information deriving from DCE. The purpose of this article is to provide a comprehensive update on the techniques, protocols, and clinical applications - both established and emerging - of DCE in whole-body imaging.", "This study was aimed at exploring the application value of transcranial Doppler (TCD) based on artificial intelligence algorithm in monitoring the neuroendocrine changes in patients with severe head injury in the acute phase; 80 patients with severe brain injury were included in this study as the study subjects, and they were randomly divided into the control group (conventional TCD) and the experimental group (algorithm-optimized TCD), 40 patients in each group. An artificial intelligence neighborhood segmentation algorithm for TCD images was designed to comprehensively evaluate the application value of this algorithm by measuring the TCD image area segmentation error and running time of this algorithm. In addition, the Glasgow coma scale (GCS) and each neuroendocrine hormone level were used to assess the neuroendocrine status of the patients. The results showed that the running time of the artificial intelligence neighborhood segmentation algorithm for TCD was 3.14 \u00b1 1.02\u2009s, which was significantly shorter than 32.23 \u00b1 9.56\u2009s of traditional convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithms (P < 0.05). The false rejection rate (FRR) of TCD image area segmentation of this algorithm was significantly reduced, and the false acceptance rate (FAR) and true acceptance rate (TAR) were significantly increased (P < 0.05). The consistent rate of the GCS score and Doppler ultrasound imaging diagnosis results in the experimental group was 93.8%, which was significantly higher than the 80.3% in the control group (P < 0.05). The consistency rate of Doppler ultrasound imaging diagnosis results of patients in the experimental group with abnormal levels of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), prolactin (PRL), growth hormone (GH), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) was significantly higher than that of the control group (P < 0.05). In summary, the artificial intelligence neighborhood segmentation algorithm can significantly shorten the processing time of the TCD image and reduce the segmentation error of the image area, which significantly improves the monitoring level of TCD for patients with severe craniocerebral injury and has good clinical application value.", "Chronic diseases are a growing concern worldwide, with nearly 25% of adults suffering from one or more chronic health conditions, thus placing a heavy burden on individuals, families, and healthcare systems. With the advent of the \"Smart Healthcare\" era, a series of cutting-edge technologies has brought new experiences to the management of chronic diseases. Among them, smart wearable technology not only helps people pursue a healthier lifestyle but also provides a continuous flow of healthcare data for disease diagnosis and treatment by actively recording physiological parameters and tracking the metabolic state. However, how to organize and analyze the data to achieve the ultimate goal of improving chronic disease management, in terms of quality of life, patient outcomes, and privacy protection, is an urgent issue that needs to be addressed. Artificial intelligence (AI) can provide intelligent suggestions by analyzing a patient's physiological data from wearable devices for the diagnosis and treatment of diseases. In addition, blockchain can improve healthcare services by authorizing decentralized data sharing, protecting the privacy of users, providing data empowerment, and ensuring the reliability of data management. Integrating AI, blockchain, and wearable technology could optimize the existing chronic disease management models, with a shift from a hospital-centered model to a patient-centered one. In this paper, we conceptually demonstrate a patient-centric technical framework based on AI, blockchain, and wearable technology and further explore the application of these integrated technologies in chronic disease management. Finally, the shortcomings of this new paradigm and future research directions are also discussed.", "In this Letter, we propose an all-optical diffractive deep neural network modeling method based on nonlinear optical materials. First, the nonlinear optical properties of graphene and zinc selenide (ZnSe) are analyzed. Then the optical limiting effect function corresponding to the saturation absorption coefficient of the nonlinear optical materials is fitted. The optical limiting effect function is taken as the nonlinear activation function of the neural network. Finally, the all-optical diffractive neural network model based on nonlinear materials is established. The numerical simulation results show that the model can effectively improve the nonlinear representation ability of the all-optical diffractive neural network. It provides a theoretical support for the further realization of a photonic artificial intelligence chip based on nonlinear optical materials.", "Intelligence is innate, but grit is something everyone can develop. Grit not only enables students to stick to their goals, but also to persevere even when they fail. Career adaptability is an important concept in vocational education of college students, which is a person engaged in some work, must have a certain physical and psychological quality. Base on the self-regulation theory, this study investigated the relationship between grit and career adaptability of Chinese college student based on the self-regulatory processes. We surveyed 839 Chinese college students and tested a self-regulation model. As expected, grit was related to greater career adaptability via greater career exploration and decision self-efficacy, positive affect, and goal commitment. These findings not only broaden the theoretical framework for the effect of grit on career adaptability, but also open up a new horizon for improving college students' career adaptability in practice.", "Low socioeconomic status (SES) may generally have a long-lasting negative effect on cognitive development, and show deficits in the development of executive functions. However, it is unclear whether there is an SES-dependent disparity in the functional brain development of the prefrontal cortex. By collecting task-related functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) data and behavioral data (e.g., intelligence, language, home reading environment (HRE), family income, and parental education level), the current study aimed to detect whether the SES of preschool children (N = 86) is associated with prefrontal activation during the joint attention task. Results verified that low-SES children show lower right prefrontal activation during joint attention than Relatively High-SES children. In addition, our findings confirmed the mediating effect of HRE on the association between SES and brain activation during joint attention, as well as that between SES and language ability. These results suggest that SES contributes to functional development of the prefrontal regions, and the improvement of HRE could be a potential strategy to intervene SES-related disparities on child development.", "Colorectal liver metastases (CRLM) have heterogenous histopathological and immunohistochemical phenotypes, which are associated with variable responses to treatment and outcomes. However, this information is usually only available after resection, and therefore of limited value in treatment planning. Improved techniques for in vivo disease assessment, which can characterise the variable tumour biology, would support further personalization of management strategies. Advanced imaging of CRLM including multiparametric MRI and functional imaging techniques have the potential to provide clinically-actionable phenotypic characterisation. This includes assessment of the tumour-liver interface, internal tumour components and treatment response. Advanced analysis techniques, including radiomics and machine learning now have a growing role in assessment of imaging, providing high-dimensional imaging feature extraction which can be linked to clinical relevant tumour phenotypes, such as a the Consensus Molecular Subtypes (CMS). In this review, we outline how imaging techniques could reproducibly characterize the histopathological features of CRLM, with several matched imaging and histology examples to illustrate these features, and discuss the oncological relevance of these features. Finally, we discuss the future challenges and opportunities of CRLM imaging, with a focus on the potential value of advanced analytics including radiomics and artificial intelligence, to help inform future research in this rapidly moving field.", "Clinical pharmacology is the study of drugs in humans, from first-in-human studies to randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and benefit-risk ratio assessment in large populations. The objective of this review is to present the recent innovations that may revolutionize the development of drugs in the future. On behalf of the French Society of Pharmacology and Therapeutics, we provide recommendations to address those future challenges in clinical pharmacology. Whatever the future will be, robust preliminary data on drug mechanism of action and rigorous study design will remain crucial prior to the start of pharmacological studies in human. At the present time, RCTs remain the gold standard to evaluate the efficacy of human drugs, although alternative designs (pragmatic trials, platform trials, etc.) are emerging. Innovations in healthy volunteers' studies and the contribution of new technologies such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, and internet-based trials have the potential to improve drug development. In the field of precision medicine, new disease phenotypes and endotypes will probably help to identify new pharmacological targets, responders to therapies, and patients at risk for drug adverse events. In such a moving landscape, the development of translational research through academic and private partnership, transparent sharing of clinical trial data and enhanced interactions between drug experts, patients, and the general public are priority areas for action.", "Since the coronavirus disease has been declared a global pandemic, it had posed a challenge among researchers and raised common awareness and collaborative efforts towards finding the solution. Caused by severe acute respiratory coronavirus syndrome-2 (SARS-CoV-2), coronavirus drug design strategy needs to be optimized. It is understandable that cognizance of the pathobiology of COVID-19 can help scientists in the development and discovery of therapeutically effective antiviral drugs by elucidating the unknown viral pathways and structures. Considering the role of artificial intelligence and machine learning with its advancements in the field of science, it is rational to use these methods which can aid in the discovery of new potent candidates in silico. Our review utilizes similar methodologies and focuses on RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), based on its importance as an essential element for virus replication and also a promising target for COVID-19 therapeutics. Artificial neural network technique was used to shortlist articles with the support of PRISMA, from different research platforms including Scopus, PubMed, PubChem, and Web of Science, through a combination of keywords. \"English language\", from the year \"2000\" and \"published articles in journals\" were selected to carry out this research. We summarized that structural details of the RdRp reviewed in this analysis will have the potential to be taken into consideration when developing therapeutic solutions and if further multidisciplinary efforts are taken in this domain then potential clinical candidates for RdRp of SARS-CoV-2 could be successfully delivered for experimental validations.", "The cornerstone of any successful organizations is the frontline employees. Frontline employees (FLEs) are always in action at the frontline of the business. They do not operate from the office space or from the corporate setting. Frontline employees directly interact with their customers. During the COVID-19 pandemic, many frontline employees experienced numerous challenges as most of the places there were full or partial lockdown imposed by the government agencies and the frontline employees could not be able to directly connect with their customers. Not many studies are there which investigated the issue of resource integration, dynamic capabilities, and engineering management abilities of the frontline employees such as technological capability, emotional intelligence, and psychological capability which perceived to influence the frontline employee adaptability and organization performance. In this background, the purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between frontline employee adaptability and organization performance during COVID-19 pandemic from technological, emotional, and psychological perspectives. With the help of dynamic capability view and different adaptability theories, a theoretical model has been developed conceptually. Later the conceptual model has been validated using partial least square - structural equation modeling technique considering 412 respondents from frontline employees of different organizations in Asia and EMEA. The study found that frontline employees' dynamic capabilities and engineering management abilities significantly and positively impact employee adaptability which in turn impact the performance of the organization mediating through employee job satisfaction and employee performance.", "This article presents a systematic overview of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer vision strategies for diagnosing the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) using computerized tomography (CT) medical images. We analyzed the previous review works and found that all of them ignored classifying and categorizing COVID-19 literature based on computer vision tasks, such as classification, segmentation, and detection. Most of the COVID-19 CT diagnosis methods comprehensively use segmentation and classification tasks. Moreover, most of the review articles are diverse and cover CT as well as X-ray images. Therefore, we focused on the COVID-19 diagnostic methods based on CT images. Well-known search engines and databases such as Google, Google Scholar, Kaggle, Baidu, IEEE Xplore, Web of Science, PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Scopus were utilized to collect relevant studies. After deep analysis, we collected 114 studies and reported highly enriched information for each selected research. According to our analysis, AI and computer vision have substantial potential for rapid COVID-19 diagnosis as they could significantly assist in automating the diagnosis process. Accurate and efficient models will have real-time clinical implications, though further research is still required. Categorization of literature based on computer vision tasks could be helpful for future research; therefore, this review article will provide a good foundation for conducting such research.", "Psychotic experiences emerge from abnormalities in perception and belief formation and occur more commonly in those experiencing childhood trauma. However, which precise aspects of belief formation are atypical in psychosis is not well understood. We used a computational modeling approach to characterize belief updating in young adults in the general population, examine their relationship with psychotic outcomes and trauma, and determine the extent to which they mediate the trauma-psychosis relationship.\nWe used data from 3360 individuals from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children birth cohort who completed assessments for psychotic outcomes, depression, anxiety, and two belief updating tasks at age 24 and had data available on traumatic events assessed from birth to late adolescence. Unadjusted and adjusted regression and counterfactual mediation methods were used for the analyses.\nBasic behavioral measures of belief updating (draws-to-decision and disconfirmatory updating) were not associated with psychotic experiences. However, computational modeling revealed an association between increased decision noise with both psychotic experiences and trauma exposure, although <3% of the trauma-psychotic experience association was mediated by decision noise. Belief updating measures were also associated with intelligence and sociodemographic characteristics, confounding most of the associations with psychotic experiences. There was little evidence that belief updating parameters were differentially associated with delusions compared with hallucinations or that they were differentially associated with psychotic outcomes compared with depression or anxiety.\nThese findings challenge the hypothesis that atypical belief updating mechanisms (as indexed by the computational models and behavioral measures we used) underlie the development of psychotic phenomena.", "Primary care is the largest healthcare delivery platform in the US. Facing the Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning technology (AI/ML) revolution, the primary care community would benefit from a roadmap revealing priority areas and opportunities for developing and integrating AI/ML-driven clinical tools. This article presents a framework that identifies five domains for AI/ML integration in primary care to support care delivery transformation and achieve the Quintuple Aims of the healthcare system. We concluded that primary care plays a critical role in developing, introducing, implementing, and monitoring AI/ML tools in healthcare and must not be overlooked as AI/ML transforms healthcare.", "As recent meta-analyses confirmed that emotional intelligence (EI), particularly strategic EI, adjoins intelligence and personality in predicting academic achievement, we explored possible arrangements in which these predictors affect the given outcome in adolescents. Three models, with versions including either overall strategic EI or its branches, were considered: (a) a mediation model, whereby strategic EI partially mediates the effects of verbal intelligence (VI) and personality on achievement; the branch-level version assumed that emotion understanding affects achievement in a cascade via emotion management; (b) a direct effects model, with strategic EI/branches placed alongside VI and personality as another independent predictor of achievement; and (c) a moderation model, whereby personality moderates the effects of VI and strategic EI/branches on achievement. We tested these models in a sample of 227 students (M = 16.50 years) and found that both the mediation and the direct effects model with overall strategic EI fit the data; there was no support for a cascade within strategic EI, nor for the assumption that personality merely moderates the effects of abilities on achievement. Principally, strategic EI both mediated the effects of VI and openness, and independently predicted academic achievement, and it did so through emotion understanding directly, \"skipping\" emotion management.", "The treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysm relies on surgical repair and the indication mainly depends on its size evaluated by the maximal diameter (Dmax). The aim of this study was to evaluate a new automatic method based on artificial intelligence to measure the Dmax on computed tomography angiography.\nA fully automatic segmentation of the vascular system was performed using a hybrid method combining expert system with supervised deep learning. The aorta centreline was extracted from the segmented aorta and the aortic diameters were automatically calculated. Results were compared to manual segmentation performed by two human operators.\nThe median absolute error between the two human operators was 1.2 mm (IQR 0.5-1.9). The automatic method using the deep learning algorithm demonstrated correlation with the human segmentation, with a median absolute error of 0.8 (0.5-4.2) mm and a coefficient correlation of 0.91 (P < 0.001).\nAlthough validation in larger cohorts is required, this method brings perspectives to develop new tools to standardize and automate the measurement of abdominal aortic aneurysm Dmax in order to help clinicians in the decision-making process.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) has wide applications in healthcare, including dermatology. Machine learning (ML) is a subfield of AI involving statistical models and algorithms that can progressively learn from data to predict the characteristics of new samples and perform a desired task. Although it has a significant role in the detection of skin cancer, dermatology skill lags behind radiology in terms of AI acceptance. With continuous spread, use, and emerging technologies, AI is becoming more widely available even to the general population. AI can be of use for the early detection of skin cancer. For example, the use of deep convolutional neural networks can help to develop a system to evaluate images of the skin to diagnose skin cancer. Early detection is key for the effective treatment and better outcomes of skin cancer. Specialists can accurately diagnose the cancer, however, considering their limited numbers, there is a need to develop automated systems that can diagnose the disease efficiently to save lives and reduce health and financial burdens on the patients. ML can be of significant use in this regard. In this article, we discuss the fundamentals of ML and its potential in assisting the diagnosis of skin cancer.", "Due to the demanding changes caused in the population by the COVID-19 pandemic, including a persisting experience of fear and social isolation, multiple studies have focused on the protective role of several psychological characteristics on mental health. Emotional intelligence and social support are commonly linked to mental health and well-being. The present study aims to analyze the mediator role of emotional intelligence and social support on university students' mental health, taking into consideration the role of gender differences. An online questionnaire was administered to a sample of 923 university students during the COVID-19 lockdown in Portugal. Significant gender differences were found on mental health symptoms, emotional intelligence, and social support. A double mediation model was computed to verify if gender influences on mental health were mediated by emotional intelligence and social support. The results show indirect effects of gender on mental health. However, as both mediators mediate in the opposite direction, the total indirect effects become null. Thus, a strong direct effect of gender on mental health remains. The results of the present study have theoretical implications on protective factors of mental health by gender and practical implications for psychological intervention in university counselling services.", "In this study, based on the known vestibulo-hippocampal connections, we asked whether mild chronic vestibulopathy leads only to vestibular-related deficits or whether there are effects on hippocampal function, structure, and cognition in general. In more detail, we assessed whether chronic vestibulopathy leads to (a) deficits in vestibular tasks without cognitive demand (balancing), (b) deficits in spatial cognitive tasks that require vestibular input (path integration, rotational memory), (c) deficits in spatial cognitive tasks that do not rely on vestibular input, (d) deficits in general cognitive function, and (e) atrophy in the brain.\nA total of 15 patients with chronic uni- or bilateral vestibulopathy (56.8 \u00b1 10.1 years; 4 females) were included in this study and were age- and gender-matched by the control participants (57.6 \u00b1 10.5) in a pairwise manner. Given their clinical symptoms and their deficits of the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) the patients could be classified as being mildly affected. All participants of the underwent the following tests: clinical balance (CBT), triangle completion (TCT) for path integration, rotational memory (RM), the visuo-spatial subset of the Berlin intelligence structure test (BIS-4) and d2-R for attention and concentration, and a structural MRI for gray matter analysis using voxel-based morphometry (VBM).\nCompared to the healthy controls, the vestibulopathy patients performed significantly worse in terms of CBT, TCT, and RM but showed no differences in terms of the BIS-4 and d2-R. There were also no significant volumetric gray matter differences between the two groups.\nThis study provides evidence that both non-cognitive and cognitive functions that rely on vestibular input (balancing, path integration, rotational memory) are impaired, even in mild chronic vestibulopathy, while other cognitive functions, which rely on visual input (visuo-spatial memory, attention), are unimpaired in this condition, together with an overall intact brain structure. These findings may reflect a segregation between vestibular- and visual-dependent processes in the medial temporal lobe on the one hand and a structure-function dissociation on the other.", "Computational approaches including machine learning, deep learning, and artificial intelligence are growing in importance in all medical specialties as large data repositories are increasingly being optimised. Radiation oncology as a discipline is at the forefront of large-scale data acquisition and well positioned towards both the production and analysis of large-scale oncologic data with the potential for clinically driven endpoints and advancement of patient outcomes. Neuro-oncology is comprised of malignancies that often carry poor prognosis and significant neurological sequelae. The analysis of radiation therapy mediated treatment and the potential for computationally mediated analyses may lead to more precise therapy by employing large scale data. We analysed the state of the literature pertaining to large scale data, computational analysis, and the advancement of molecular biomarkers in neuro-oncology with emphasis on radiation oncology. We aimed to connect existing and evolving approaches to realistic avenues for clinical implementation focusing on low grade gliomas (LGG), high grade gliomas (HGG), management of the elderly patient with HGG, rare central nervous system tumors, craniospinal irradiation, and re-irradiation to examine how computational analysis and molecular science may synergistically drive advances in personalised radiation therapy (RT) and optimise patient outcomes.", "Accurate prediction of tumour response to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy enables personalised perioperative therapy for locally advanced rectal cancer. We aimed to develop and validate an artificial intelligence radiopathomics integrated model to predict pathological complete response in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer using pretreatment MRI and haematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained biopsy slides.\nIn this multicentre observational study, eligible participants who had undergone neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy followed by radical surgery were recruited, with their pretreatment pelvic MRI (T2-weighted imaging, contrast-enhanced T1-weighted imaging, and diffusion-weighted imaging) and whole slide images of H&E-stained biopsy sections collected for annotation and feature extraction. The RAdioPathomics Integrated preDiction System (RAPIDS) was constructed by machine learning on the basis of three feature sets associated with pathological complete response: radiomics MRI features, pathomics nucleus features, and pathomics microenvironment features from a retrospective training cohort. The accuracy of RAPIDS for the prediction of pathological complete response in locally advanced rectal cancer was verified in two retrospective external validation cohorts and further validated in a multicentre, prospective observational study (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04271657). Model performances were evaluated using area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV).\nBetween Sept 25, 2009, and Nov 3, 2017, 303 patients were retrospectively recruited in the training cohort, 480 in validation cohort 1, and 150 in validation cohort 2; 100 eligible patients were enrolled in the prospective study between Jan 10 and June 10, 2020. RAPIDS had favourable accuracy for the prediction of pathological complete response in the training cohort (AUC 0\u00b7868 [95% CI 0\u00b7825-0\u00b7912]), and in validation cohort 1 (0\u00b7860 [0\u00b7828-0\u00b7892]) and validation cohort 2 (0\u00b7872 [0\u00b7810-0\u00b7934]). In the prospective validation study, RAPIDS had an AUC of 0\u00b7812 (95% CI 0\u00b7717-0\u00b7907), sensitivity of 0\u00b7888 (0\u00b7728-0\u00b7999), specificity of 0\u00b7740 (0\u00b7593-0\u00b7886), NPV of 0\u00b7929 (0\u00b7862-0\u00b7995), and PPV of 0\u00b7512 (0\u00b7313-0\u00b7710). RAPIDS also significantly outperformed single-modality prediction models (AUC 0\u00b7630 [0\u00b7507-0\u00b7754] for the pathomics microenvironment model, 0\u00b7716 [0\u00b7580-0\u00b7852] for the radiomics MRI model, and 0\u00b7733 [0\u00b7620-0\u00b7845] for the pathomics nucleus model; all p<0\u00b70001).\nRAPIDS was able to predict pathological complete response to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy based on pretreatment radiopathomics images with high accuracy and robustness and could therefore provide a novel tool to assist in individualised management of locally advanced rectal cancer.\nNational Natural Science Foundation of China; Youth Innovation Promotion Association of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.", "Developing new, more effective antibiotics against resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis that inhibit its essential proteins is an appealing strategy for combating the global tuberculosis (TB) epidemic. Finding a compound that can target a particular cavity in a protein and interrupt its enzymatic activity is the crucial objective of drug design and discovery. Such a compound is then subjected to different tests, including clinical trials, to study its effectiveness against the pathogen in the host. In recent times, new techniques, which involve computational and analytical methods, enhanced the chances of drug development, as opposed to traditional drug design methods, which are laborious and time-consuming. The computational techniques in drug design have been improved with a new generation of software used to develop and optimize active compounds that can be used in future chemotherapeutic development to combat global tuberculosis resistance. This review provides an overview of the evolution of tuberculosis resistance, existing drug management, and the design of new anti-tuberculosis drugs developed based on the contributions of computational techniques. Also, we show an appraisal of available software and databases on computational drug design with an insight into the application of this software and databases in the development of anti-tubercular drugs. The review features a perspective involving machine learning, artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and CRISPR combination with available computational techniques as a prospective pathway to design new anti-tubercular drugs to combat resistant tuberculosis.", "Emotional intelligence (EI) refers to the ability to perceive, express, understand, and manage emotions. Current research indicates that it may protect against the emotional burden experienced in certain professions. This article aims to provide an updated systematic review of existing instruments to assess EI in professionals, focusing on the description of their characteristics as well as their psychometric properties (reliability and validity). A literature search was conducted in Web of Science (WoS). A total of 2761 items met the eligibility criteria, from which a total of 40 different instruments were extracted and analysed. Most were based on three main models (i.e., skill-based, trait-based, and mixed), which differ in the way they conceptualize and measure EI. All have been shown to have advantages and disadvantages inherent to the type of tool. The instruments reported in the largest number of studies are Emotional Quotient Inventory (EQ-i), Schutte Self Report-Inventory (SSRI), Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test 2.0 (MSCEIT 2.0), Trait Meta-Mood Scale (TMMS), Wong and Law's Emotional Intelligence Scale (WLEIS), and Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire (TEIQue). The main measure of the estimated reliability has been internal consistency, and the construction of EI measures was predominantly based on linear modelling or classical test theory. The study has limitations: we only searched a single database, the impossibility of estimating inter-rater reliability, and non-compliance with some items required by PRISMA.", "Innovative development in the energy and chemical industries is mainly dependent on advances in the accelerated design and development of new functional materials. The success of research in new nanocatalysts mainly relies on modern techniques and approaches for their precise characterization. The existing methods of experimental characterization of nanocatalysts, which make it possible to assess the possibility of using these materials in specific chemical reactions or applications, generate significant amounts of heterogeneous data. The acceleration of new functional materials, including nanocatalysts, directly depends on the speed and quality of extracting hidden dependencies and knowledge from the obtained experimental data. Usually, such experiments involve different characterization techniques and different types of X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) too. Using the machine learning (ML) methods based on XAS data, we can study and predict the atomic-scale structure and another bunch of parameters for the nanocatalyst efficiently. However, before using any ML model, it is necessary to make sure that the XAS raw experimental data is properly pre-processed, cleared, and prepared for ML application. Usually, the XAS preprocessing stage is vaguely presented in scientific studies, and the main efforts of researchers are devoted to the ML description and implementation stage. However, the quality of the input data influences the quality of ML analysis and the prediction results used in the future. This paper fills the gap between the stage of obtaining XAS data from synchrotron facilities and the stage of using and customizing various ML analysis and prediction models. We aimed this study to develop automated tools for the preprocessing and presentation of data from physical experiments and the creation of deposited datasets on the basis of the example of studying palladium-based nanocatalysts using synchrotron radiation facilities. During the study, methods of preliminary processing of XAS data were considered, which can be conditionally divided into X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS). This paper proposes a software toolkit that implements data preprocessing scenarios in the form of a single pipeline. The main preprocessing methods used in this study proposed are principal component analysis (PCA); z-score normalization; the interquartile method for eliminating outliers in the data; as well as the k-means machine learning method, which makes it possible to clarify the phase of the studied material sample by clustering feature vectors of experiments. Among the results of this study, one should also highlight the obtained deposited datasets of physical experiments on palladium-based nanocatalysts using synchrotron radiation. This will allow for further high-quality data mining to extract new knowledge about materials using artificial intelligence methods and machine learning models, and will ensure the smooth dissemination of these datasets to researchers and their reuse.", "In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, many researchers have developed artificial intelligence (AI) tools to differentiate COVID-19 pneumonia from other conditions in chest CT. However, in many cases, performance has not been clinically validated. The aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of commercial AI solutions in differentiating COVID-19 pneumonia from other lung conditions.\nFour commercial AI solutions were evaluated on a dual-center clinical dataset consisting of 500 CT studies; COVID-19 pneumonia was microbiologically proven in 50 of these. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and AUC were calculated. In a subgroup analysis, the performance of the AI solutions in differentiating COVID-19 pneumonia from other conditions was evaluated in CT studies with ground-glass opacities (GGOs).\nSensitivity and specificity ranges were 62-96% and 31-80%, respectively. Negative and positive predictive values ranged between 82-99% and 19-25%, respectively. AUC was in the range 0.54-0.79. In CT studies with GGO, sensitivity remained unchanged. However, specificity was lower, and ranged between 15 and 53%. AUC for studies with GGO was in the range 0.54-0.69.\nThis study highlights the variable specificity and low positive predictive value of AI solutions in diagnosing COVID-19 pneumonia in chest CT. However, one solution yielded acceptable values for sensitivity. Thus, with further improvement, commercial AI solutions currently under development have the potential to be integrated as alert tools in clinical routine workflow. Randomized trials are needed to assess the true benefits and also potential harms of the use of AI in image analysis.\n\u2022 Commercial AI solutions achieved a sensitivity and specificity ranging from 62 to 96% and from 31 to 80%, respectively, in identifying patients suspicious for COVID-19 in a clinical dataset. \u2022 Sensitivity remained within the same range, while specificity was even lower in subgroup analysis of CT studies with ground-glass opacities, and interrater agreement between the commercial AI solutions was minimal to nonexistent. \u2022 Thus, commercial AI solutions have the potential to be integrated as alert tools for the detection of patients with lung changes suspicious for COVID-19 pneumonia in a clinical routine workflow, if further improvement is made.", "Treatment of malocclusion with clear removable appliances like Invisalign\u00ae or Spark\u2122, require considerable higher level of patient compliance when compared to conventional fixed braces. The clinical outcomes and treatment efficiency strongly depend on the patient's discipline. Smart treatment coaching applications, like strojCHECK\u00ae are efficient for improving patient compliance.\nTo evaluate the impact of computerized personalized decision algorithms responding to observed and anticipated patient behavior implemented as an update of an existing clinical orthodontic application (app).\nVariables such as (1) patient app interaction, (2) patient app discipline and (3) clinical aligner tracking evaluated by artificial intelligence system (AI) system-Dental monitoring\u00ae were observed on the set of 86 patients. Two 60-day periods were evaluated; before and after the app was updated with decision tree processes.\nAll variables showed significant improvement after the update except for the manifestation of clinical non-tracking in men, evaluated by artificial intelligence from video scans.\nImplementation of application update including computerized decision processes can significantly enhance clinical performance of existing health care applications and improve patients' compliance. Using the algorithm with decision tree architecture could create a baseline for further machine learning optimization.", "Background and Objectives: Device-assisted enteroscopy (DAE) allows deep exploration of the small bowel and combines diagnostic and therapeutic capacities. Suspected mid-gastrointestinal bleeding is the most frequent indication for DAE, and vascular lesions, particularly angioectasia, are the most common etiology. Nevertheless, the diagnostic yield of DAE for the detection of these lesions is suboptimal. Deep learning algorithms have shown great potential for automatic detection of lesions in endoscopy. We aimed to develop an artificial intelligence (AI) model for the automatic detection of angioectasia DAE images. Materials and Methods: A convolutional neural network (CNN) was developed using DAE images. Each frame was labeled as normal/mucosa or angioectasia. The image dataset was split for the constitution of training and validation datasets. The latter was used for assessing the performance of the CNN. Results: A total of 72 DAE exams were included, and 6740 images were extracted (5345 of normal mucosa and 1395 of angioectasia). The model had a sensitivity of 88.5%, a specificity of 97.1% and an AUC of 0.988. The image processing speed was 6.4 ms/frame. Conclusions: The application of AI to DAE may have a significant impact on the management of patients with suspected mid-gastrointestinal bleeding.", "Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common complication of hospitalization that greatly and negatively affects the short-term and long-term outcomes of patients. Current guidelines use serum creatinine level and urine output rate for defining AKI and as the staging criteria of AKI. However, because they are not sensitive or specific markers of AKI, clinicians find it difficult to predict the occurrence of AKI and prescribe timely treatment. Advances in computing technology have led to the recent use of machine learning and artificial intelligence in AKI prediction, recent research reported that by using electronic health records (EHR) the AKI prediction via machine-learning models can reach AUROC over 0.80, in some studies even reach 0.93. Our review begins with the background and history of the definition of AKI, and the evolution of AKI risk factors and prediction models is also appraised. Then, we summarize the current evidence regarding the application of e-alert systems and machine-learning models in AKI prediction.", "Visual tracking of moving objects requires sustained attention and prediction of the object's trajectory. We tested the hypothesis that measures of eye-head tracking of moving objects are associated to long-term neurodevelopment in very preterm infants.\nVisual tracking performance was assessed at 4 month's corrected age in 57 infants with gestational age <32 weeks. An object moved in front of the infant with sinusoidal or triangular (i.e. abrupt) turns of the direction. Gaze gain, smooth pursuit gain, and timing of gaze to object motion were analyzed. At 6.5 years the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC-IV), the Brown Attention Deficit Disorder (Brown ADD), and visual examination were performed.\nGaze gain and smooth pursuit gain at 4 months were strongly related to all WISC-IV parameters at 6.5 years. Gaze gain for the triangular and sinusoidal motion patterns related similarly to the cognitive scores. For the sinusoidal motion pattern, timing related to most Brown ADD parameters. There were no statistically significant differences in associations dependent on motion pattern. Visual function did not influence the results.\nThe ability to attend to and smoothly track a moving object in infancy is an early marker of cognition and attention at 6.5 years.\nPotential long-term implications of infant visual tracking of moving objects for school-age neurodevelopment has not been previously studied in very preterm infants. Early coordination of eye and head movements in gaze gain, smooth pursuit, and timing of gaze to object motion are closely associated with cognition and attention at 6.5 years. As related functions at 6.5 years include perceptual and verbal skills, working memory, processing speed and attention, predictive elements in gaze tracking of moving objects might be a suitable target for future intervention studies.", "To study the relationship between folic acid and 25-hydroxy vitamin D[25(OH)D] and intelligence and core symptoms in children with autism.\nA total of 124 children with autism aged 3-6 years who were admitted to The Fouth Affiliated Hospital of Qiqihar Medical College from March 2018 to March 2021 were enrolled as the case group, and 120 healthy children who underwent physical examination in hospital during the same period were selected as the control group. Respectively in the hospital the same day or physical examination on two groups of children fasting venous blood collected 4 mL, let stand centrifugal after processing into-80 \u2103 refrigerator, using chemiluminescence immunoassay and high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry detection of two groups of children folic acid and serum 25(OH)D level, using enzyme-linked immunosorbent method to detect the serum level of folic acid metabolites. For the children in the case group and the control group, the Wechsler scale for early childhood and child intelligence(WISC) was used to assess intelligence. Core symptoms of autism were assessed using the behavior scale for autistic children(ABC). T test was used to compare serum folic acid and 25(OH)D levels, WISC and ABC scale scores between the case group and the control group. Pearson correlation analysis was conducted to determine the relationship between serum folic acid, 25(OH)D level and intelligence and core symptoms in children with autism.\nThe serum folic acid and 25(OH)D levels in the case group were(16.13\u00b14.26) ng/mL and(25.78\u00b13.24) ng/mL respectively, which were lower than those in the control group(21.58\u00b15.37) ng/mL and(36.94\u00b16.11) ng/mL, with statistical significance(all P&lt;0.05). The WISC scale score of the case group was(62.83\u00b111.73) points, lower than that of the control group(89.42\u00b112.58) points, while the ABC scale score was(77.39\u00b110.28) points, higher than that of the control group(42.30\u00b15.87) points, with statistical significance(all P&lt;0.05). Pearson correlation analysis showed that serum folic acid and 25(OH)D levels were positively correlated with WISC score(r=0.512, 0.584; P=0.012, 0.001), and was negatively correlated with ABC scale score(r=-0.546, -0.602; P=0.008, &lt;0.001). The serum THFA and 5-MTHF levels in the case group were(3.85\u00b11.22) ng/mL and(4.84\u00b11.32) ng/mL respectively, which were lower than those in the control group(4.30\u00b11.51) ng/mL and(5.34\u00b11.34) ng/mL respectively. The serum FRAA level was(433.29\u00b174.34) pg/mL, higher than that of the control group(402.10\u00b165.87) pg/mL, with statistical significance(all P&lt;0.05).\nThe serum folic acid and 25(OH)D levels are lower in children with autism, and are closely related to the intelligence and core symptoms of the children, that is, with the decline of the two serological indicators, the lower the intelligence of children with autism, and the more obvious the core symptoms.", "We tested the hypothesis that artificial intelligence (AI)-powered algorithms applied to cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) images could be able to detect the potential patterns of cardiac amyloidosis (CA). Readers in CMR centers with a low volume of referrals for the detection of myocardial storage diseases or a low volume of CMRs, in general, may overlook CA. In light of the growing prevalence of the disease and emerging therapeutic options, there is an urgent need to avoid misdiagnoses.\nUsing CMR data from 502 patients (CA: n = 82), we trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to automatically diagnose patients with CA. We compared the diagnostic accuracy of different state-of-the-art deep learning techniques on common CMR imaging protocols in detecting imaging patterns associated with CA. As a result of a 10-fold cross-validated evaluation, the best-performing fine-tuned CNN achieved an average ROC AUC score of 0.96, resulting in a diagnostic accuracy of 94% sensitivity and 90% specificity.\nApplying AI to CMR to diagnose CA may set a remarkable milestone in an attempt to establish a fully computational diagnostic path for the diagnosis of CA, in order to support the complex diagnostic work-up requiring a profound knowledge of experts from different disciplines.", "First- and second-hand exposure to smoke or air pollutants is the primary cause of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) pathogenesis, where genetic and age-related factors predispose the subject to the initiation and progression of obstructive lung disease. Briefly, airway inflammation, specifically bronchitis, initiates the lung disease, leading to difficulty in breathing (dyspnea) and coughing as initial symptoms, followed by air trapping and inhibition of the flow of air into the lungs due to damage to the alveoli (emphysema). In addition, mucus obstruction and impaired lung clearance mechanisms lead to recurring acute exacerbations causing progressive decline in lung function, eventually requiring lung transplant and other lifesaving interventions to prevent mortality. It is noteworthy that COPD is much more common in the population than currently diagnosed, as only 16 million adult Americans were reported to be diagnosed with COPD as of 2018, although an additional 14 million American adults were estimated to be suffering from COPD but undiagnosed by the current standard of care (SOC) diagnostic, namely the spirometry-based pulmonary function test (PFT). Thus, the main issue driving the adverse disease outcome and significant mortality for COPD is lack of timely diagnosis in the early stages of the disease. The current treatment regime for COPD emphysema is most effective when implemented early, on COPD onset, where alleviating symptoms and exacerbations with timely intervention(s) can prevent steep lung function decline(s) and disease progression to severe emphysema. Therefore, the key to efficiently combatting COPD relies on early detection. Thus, it is important to detect early regional pulmonary function and structural changes to monitor modest disease progression for implementing timely interventions and effectively eliminating emphysema progression. Currently, COPD diagnosis involves using techniques such as COPD screening questionnaires, PFT, arterial blood gas analysis, and/or lung imaging, but these modalities are limited in their capability for early diagnosis and real-time disease monitoring of regional lung function changes. Hence, promising emerging techniques, such as X-ray phase contrast, photoacoustic tomography, ultrasound computed tomography, electrical impedance tomography, the forced oscillation technique, and the impulse oscillometry system powered by robust artificial intelligence and machine learning analysis capability are emerging as novel solutions for early detection and real time monitoring of COPD progression for timely intervention. We discuss here the scope, risks, and limitations of current SOC and emerging COPD diagnostics, with perspective on novel diagnostics providing real time regional lung function monitoring, and predicting exacerbation and/or disease onset for prognosis-based timely intervention(s) to limit COPD-emphysema progression.", "Primary cicatricial alopecias (PCA) represent a challenging group of disorders that result in irreversible hair loss from the destruction and fibrosis of hair follicles. Scalp skin biopsies are considered essential in investigating these conditions. Unfortunately, the recognised complexity of histopathologic interpretation is compounded by inadequate sampling and inappropriate laboratory processing. By sharing our successes in developing the communication pathway between the clinician, laboratory and histopathologist, we hope to mitigate some of the difficulties that can arise in managing these conditions. We provide insight from clinical and pathology practice into how diagnoses are derived and the key histological features observed across the most common PCAs seen in practice. Additionally, we highlight the opportunities that have emerged with advances in digital pathology and how these technologies may be used to develop clinicopathological relationships, improve working practices, enhance remote learning, reduce inefficiencies, optimise diagnostic yield, and harness the potential of artificial intelligence (AI).", "Artificial intelligence (AI) is a new technology that has been employed to screen and discover new drugs. Using AI, an anti-diabetic treatment (Halicin) was nominated and proven to have a unique antibacterial activity against several harmful bacterial strains, including multidrug-resistant bacteria. This study aims to explore the antibacterial effect of halicin and microbial susceptibility using the zone of inhibition and the minimum inhibition concentration (MIC) values while assessing the stability of stored halicin over a period of time with cost-effective and straightforward methods. Linear regression graphs were constructed, and the correlation coefficient was calculated. The new antibacterial agent was able to inhibit all tested gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial strains, but in different concentrations-including the A. baumannii multidrug-resistant (MDR) isolate. The MIC of halicin was found to be 16 \u03bcg/mL for S. aureus (ATCC BAA-977), 32 \u03bcg/mL for E. coli (ATCC 25922), 128 \u03bcg/mL for A. baumannii (ATCC BAA-747), and 256 \u03bcg/mL for MDR A. baumannii. Upon storage, the MICs were increased, suggesting instability of the drug after approximately a week of storage at 4 \u00b0C. MICs and zones of inhibition were found to be high (R = 0.90 to 0.98), suggesting that halicin has a promising antimicrobial activity and may be used as a wide-spectrum antibacterial drug. However, the drug's pharmacokinetics have not been investigated, and further elucidation is needed.", "Artificial intelligence makes surgical resection easier and safer, and, at the same time, can improve oncological results. The robotic system fits perfectly with these more or less diffused technologies, and it seems that this benefit is mutual. In liver surgery, robotic systems help surgeons to localize tumors and improve surgical results with well-defined preoperative planning or increased intraoperative detection. Furthermore, they can balance the absence of tactile feedback and help recognize intrahepatic biliary or vascular structures during parenchymal transection. Some of these systems are well known and are already widely diffused in open and laparoscopic hepatectomies, such as indocyanine green fluorescence or ultrasound-guided resections, whereas other tools, such as Augmented Reality, are far from being standardized because of the high complexity and elevated costs. In this paper, we review all the experiences in the literature on the use of artificial intelligence systems in robotic liver resections, describing all their practical applications and their weaknesses.", "While the link between sensory-processing sensitivity (SPS) and internalizing symptoms has been well-established, a link to externalizing problems is still to be explored. This study aimed to further examine the relation between SPS and behavioral problems by testing the potential mediating roles of trait emotional intelligence (TEI) and decision-making styles. Pathway analyses were conducted on data from 268 community sample participants (Mage = 25.81, SD = 2.41, 61.2% females). Results indicated gender differences in the pathway level outcomes of SPS, as well as potential partial mediators in men and women. SPS both directly and via the mediating effects of the well-being factor (TEI) and avoidant decision-making influenced depression, regardless of gender. Direct effects on aggression were, however, obtained only in the male sample. Indirect effects of SPS on aggression were found in spontaneous decision-making for men and in the self-control and sociability factors of TEI for women. Directions for future research were discussed.", "This review focuses on the synthesis of current experimental and observational data regarding the effect of fluoride exposure on childhood mental health and the role of mitochondrial function as a mechanism of action. We aggregated data on the relationships between fluoride neurotoxicity, mitochondrial function, and cognitive and mental health using PubMed. Current animal and human research suggest that prenatal and perinatal fluoride exposure might have neurotoxic effects. These studies observed physical changes (fur loss and delayed reflex development in animals), intelligence loss, increased hyperactivity, and irregular moods associated with fluoride exposure. Two gaps in the literature were identified: (1) there is limited research on the mental and emotional impacts of fluoride exposure compared to research on cognitive outcomes, and (2) human studies primarily focus on prenatal and perinatal exposure, with little research conducted at other time points (e.g., adolescence). Furthermore, there is no agreed-upon mechanism for the neurotoxic effects of fluoride; however, fluoride can induce mitochondrial damage, including decreasing circulating mitochondrial DNA content, dysregulating biogenesis, and circular structure loss. Additionally, many neurodevelopmental conditions have mitochondrial underpinnings. More work is needed to elucidate the impact and timing of fluoride exposure on mental health and the role of mitochondrial function as a biological mechanism.", "To evaluate the 1-year visual acuity predictive performance of an artificial intelligence (AI) based model applied to optical coherence tomography angiography (OCT-A) vascular layers scans from eyes with a full-thickness macular hole (FTMH).\nIn this observational cross-sectional, single-center study, 35 eyes of 35 patients with FTMH were analyzed by OCT-A before and 1-year after surgery. Superficial vascular plexus (SVP) and deep vascular plexus (DVP) images were collected for the analysis. AI approach based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) was used to generate a continuous predictive variable based on both SVP and DPV. Different pre-trained CNN networks were used for feature extraction and compared for predictive accuracy.\nAmong the different tested models, the inception V3 network, applied on the combination of deep and superficial OCT-A images, showed the most significant differences between the two obtained image clusters defined in C1 and C2 (best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) C1 = 66.67 (16.00 SD) and BCVA C2 = 49.10 (18.60 SD, p = 0.005)).\nThe AI-based analysis of preoperative OCT-A images of eyes affected by FTMH may be a useful support system in setting up visual acuity recovery prediction. The combination of preoperative SVP and DVP images showed a significant morphological predictive performance for visual acuity recovery.", "Cervical vertebral maturation (CVM) is widely used to evaluate growth potential in the field of orthodontics. This study is aimed to develop an artificial intelligence (AI) system to automatically determine the CVM status and evaluate the AI performance.\nA total of 1080 cephalometric radiographs, with the age of patients ranging from 6 to 22 years old, were included in the dataset (980 in training dataset and 100 in testing dataset). Two reference points and thirteen anatomical points were labelled and the cervical vertebral maturation staging (CS) was assessed by human examiners as gold standard. A convolutional neural network (CNN) model was built to train on 980 images and to test on 100 images. Statistical analysis was conducted to detect labelling differences between AI and human examiners, AI performance was also evaluated.\nThe mean labelling error between human examiners was 0.48 \u00b1 0.12 mm. The mean labelling error between AI and human examiners was 0.36 \u00b1 0.09 mm. In general, the agreement between AI results and the gold standard was good, with the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) value being up to 98%. Moreover, the accuracy of CVM staging was 71%. In terms of F1 score, CS6 stage (85%) ranked the highest accuracy.\nIn this study, AI showed a good agreement with human examiners, being a useful and reliable tool in assessing the cervical vertebral maturation.", "In order to have an accurate and fast prediction of the artificial intelligence (AI) model, the choice of input features is at least as important as the choice of model. The effect of input features selection on the emission models of light diesel vehicles driven on real roads was investigated in this paper. The gradient boosting regression (GBR) model was used to train and to predict the emissions of nitrogen oxide (NOx), carbon dioxide (CO2), and the fuel consumption of real driving diesel vehicles in urban scenarios, the suburbs, and on highways. A portable emissions measurement system (PEMS) system was used to collect data of vehicles as well as environmental conditions. The vehicle was run on two routes. The model was trained with the first route data and was used to predict the emissions of the second route. There were ten features related to the NOx model and nine features associated with the CO2 model. The importance of each feature was sorted, and a different number of features were used as input to train the models. The best NOx model had the coefficient of determination (R2) values of 0.99, 0.99, and 0.99 in each driving pattern (urban, suburbs, and highways). Predictions of the second route had the R2 values of 0.88, 0.89, and 0.96 respectively. The best CO2 model had the R2 values of 0.98, 0.99, and 0.99 in each driving pattern, respectively. Predictions of the second route had the R2 values are 0.79, 0.82, and 0.83, respectively. The most important features for the NOx model are mass air flow rate (g/s), exhaust flow rate (m3/min), and CO2 (ppm), while the important features for the CO2 model are exhaust flow rate (m3/min) and mass air flow rate (g/s). It is noted that the regression models based on the top three features may give predictions very close to the measured data.", "As costs decline and technology inevitably improves, current trends suggest that artificial intelligence (AI) and a variety of \"carebots\" will increasingly be adopted in medical care. Medical ethicists have long expressed concerns that such technologies remove the human element from medicine, resulting in dehumanization and depersonalized care. However, we argue that where shame presents a barrier to medical care, it is sometimes ethically permissible and even desirable to deploy AI/carebots because (i) dehumanization in medicine is not always morally wrong, and (ii) dehumanization can sometimes better promote and protect important medical values. Shame is often a consequence of the human-to-human element of medical care and can prevent patients from seeking treatment and from disclosing important information to their healthcare provider. Conditions and treatments that are shame-inducing offer opportunities for introducing AI/carebots in a manner that removes the human element of medicine but does so ethically. We outline numerous examples of shame-inducing interactions and how they are overcome by implementing existing and expected developments of AI/carebot technology that remove the human element from care.", "The aim of this study was to determine the impact of oral health on adolescent quality of life and to compare the results obtained using standard statistical methods and artificial intelligence algorithms. In order to measure the impact of oral health on adolescent quality of life, a validated Serbian version of the Oral Impacts on Daily Performance (OIDP) scale was used. The total sample comprised 374 respondents. The obtained results were processed using standard statistical methods and machine learning, i.e., artificial intelligence algorithms-singular value decomposition. OIDP score was dichotomized into two categories depending on whether the respondents had or did not have oral or teeth problems affecting their life quality. Human intuition and machine algorithms came to the same conclusion on how the respondents should be divided. As such, method quality and the need to perform analyses of this type in dentistry studies were demonstrated. Using artificial intelligence algorithms, the respondents can be clustered into characteristic groups that allow the discovery of details not possible with the intuitive division of respondents by gender.", "Whether an individual meets psychometric criteria for cognitive impairment is dictated by the comparison criterion, which is typically either a normative mean or a known or estimated previous level of ability. This study investigated the conditions under which adjusting normative expectations based on estimated premorbid intelligence would be appropriate. A simulated data set was derived and several parameters were systematically varied: the correlation between premorbid intelligence and the cognitive test score, the cutoff used to classify a score as \"normal\" or \"abnormal\", and the population base rate of cognitive impairment. Simulation results demonstrated that the correlation between premorbid intelligence and the cognitive score was the only parameter to substantially influence the trade-off between the two normative approaches, with correlations above \u03c1 = .35 signifying greater advantage to adjusting normative expectations by premorbid intelligence. These findings inform common neuropsychological practices regarding the application of premorbid intelligence estimates to the detection of cognitive impairment.

Both statistical and artificial intelligence (AI) approaches have been reported; however, the AI approaches showed a better accuracy compared with the statistical approaches. This study presents a review on the applications of different AI approaches used in forecasting the spread of this pandemic. The fundamentals of the commonly used AI approaches in this context are briefly explained. Evaluation of the forecasting accuracy using different statistical measures is introduced. This review may assist researchers, experts and policy makers involved in managing the COVID-19 pandemic to develop more accurate forecasting models and enhanced strategies to control the spread of this pandemic. Additionally, this review study is highly significant as it provides more important information of AI applications in forecasting the prevalence of this pandemic.", "Long-term studies indicated changes in aspects of cognition, psychopathology, and quality of life (QOL) in children and adolescents followed up after the diagnosis of epilepsy. However, evidence is limited regarding what happens during the first few months after epilepsy is diagnosed because at this phase is possible to adjust and/or change an AED regimen or add other treatment interventions, if needed. This is a naturalistic, six months follow-up study that evaluated changes in overall cognitive profiles, levels of psychopathological symptoms, and quality of life (QOL) in newly diagnosed, uncomplicated pediatric epilepsy. In total, 61 (35 [57.4%] males) children and adolescents aged 7-18 years were assessed at the time of diagnosis and the initiation of antiepileptic drug (AED) treatment and six months afterward. The Revised Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, the Revised Child Anxiety and Depression Scale (RCADS), Nisonger Child Behavior Rating Form for typically developing children and adolescents (NCBRF), KIDSCREEN-10 Quality of Life Measure, and Adverse Event Profile (AEP) were used. The RCADS and NCBRF scores significantly increased over time, while the KIDSCREEN-10 scores significantly decreased. The most significant increases were observed in scores measuring social phobia and depressive symptoms and inattentiveness. Verbal cognitive abilities and full-scale intelligence scores changed slightly, while more changes were found in aspects of non-verbal cognitive abilities. This study showed that six months after epilepsy diagnosis and AED initiation, there were marked increases in anxiety levels, depressive symptoms, and behavioral problems, with deteriorations in QOL, while cognitive changes were relatively minimal. Therefore, monitoring levels of psychopathological symptoms and QOL in newly diagnosed epilepsy is highly recommended.", "Hemorrhage is a leading cause of trauma death, particularly in prehospital environments when evacuation is delayed. Obtaining central vascular access to a deep artery or vein is important for administration of emergency drugs and analgesics, and rapid replacement of blood volume, as well as invasive sensing and emerging life-saving interventions. However, central access is normally performed by highly experienced critical care physicians in a hospital setting. We developed a handheld AI-enabled interventional device, AI-GUIDE (Artificial Intelligence Guided Ultrasound Interventional Device), capable of directing users with no ultrasound or interventional expertise to catheterize a deep blood vessel, with an initial focus on the femoral vein. AI-GUIDE integrates with widely available commercial portable ultrasound systems and guides a user in ultrasound probe localization, venous puncture-point localization, and needle insertion. The system performs vascular puncture robotically and incorporates a preloaded guidewire to facilitate the Seldinger technique of catheter insertion. Results from tissue-mimicking phantom and porcine studies under normotensive and hypotensive conditions provide evidence of the technique's robustness, with key performance metrics in a live porcine model including: a mean time to acquire femoral vein insertion point of 53 \u00b1 36 s (5 users with varying experience, in 20 trials), a total time to insert catheter of 80 \u00b1 30 s (1 user, in 6 trials), and a mean number of 1.1 (normotensive, 39 trials) and 1.3 (hypotensive, 55 trials) needle insertion attempts (1 user). These performance metrics in a porcine model are consistent with those for experienced medical providers performing central vascular access on humans in a hospital.", "Background & Aims: The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates a broad range of consumer products, which account for about 25% of the United States market. The FDA regulatory activities often involve producing and reading of a large number of documents, which is time consuming and labor intensive. To support regulatory science at FDA, we evaluated artificial intelligence (AI)-based natural language processing (NLP) of regulatory documents for text classification and compared deep learning-based models with a conventional keywords-based model. Methods: FDA drug labeling documents were used as a representative regulatory data source to classify drug-induced liver injury (DILI) risk by employing the state-of-the-art language model BERT. The resulting NLP-DILI classification model was statistically validated with both internal and external validation procedures and applied to the labeling data from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for cross-agency application. Results: The NLP-DILI model developed using FDA labeling documents and evaluated by cross-validations in this study showed remarkable performance in DILI classification with a recall of 1 and a precision of 0.78. When cross-agency data were used to validate the model, the performance remained comparable, demonstrating that the model was portable across agencies. Results also suggested that the model was able to capture the semantic meanings of sentences in drug labeling. Conclusion: Deep learning-based NLP models performed well in DILI classification of drug labeling documents and learned the meanings of complex text in drug labeling. This proof-of-concept work demonstrated that using AI technologies to assist regulatory activities is a promising approach to modernize and advance regulatory science.", "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is increasingly common, though often undiagnosed, leaving many people untreated and at elevated risk of ischaemic stroke. Current European guidelines do not recommend systematic screening for AF, even though a number of studies have shown that periods of serial or continuous rhythm monitoring in older people in the general population increase detection of AF and the prescription of oral anticoagulation. This article discusses the conflicting results of two contemporary landmark trials, STROKESTOP and the LOOP, which provided the first evidence on whether screening for AF confers a benefit for people in terms of clinical outcomes. The benefit and efficiency of systematic screening for AF in the general population could be optimized by targeting screening to only those at higher risk of developing AF. For this purpose, evidence is emerging that prediction models developed using artificial intelligence in routinely collected electronic health records can provide strong discriminative performance for AF and increase detection rates when combined with rhythm monitoring in a clinical study. We consider future directions for investigation in this field and how this could be best aligned to the current evidence base to target screening in people at elevated risk of stroke.", "In the US, undeniable evidence shows that socioeconomic inequities explain a high proportion of individual differences in school achievement. Although not all countries show this same effect due to socioeconomic status, it is consistently found that social inequities lead to achievement gaps. These achievement gaps then manifest into trajectories that set some individuals on a path of lower incomes, poorer health and higher mortality, lower wellbeing, and other poor adult outcomes. Like James Flynn so handily reminded the scientific literature that achievement gaps are explainable by environmental factors, the inequities we see around the world are based on environments some children are exposed to. In his work, Flynn stated his belief that the suppression of scientific work on intelligence would continue to lead to social inequities. We wish to take this idea and move it forward. We believe that the scientific construct of intelligence plays a key role in helping create a more equitable society through science. We also believe that the poor perception of intelligence, rooted in historical realities, means that it will continue to be misunderstood, feared, and misused, limiting how effective it could be in helping to close gaps in achievement and in creating a more equitable society.", "Despite the technological advancements in Virtual Reality (VR), users are constantly combating feelings of nausea and disorientation, the so-called cybersickness. Cybersickness symptoms cause severe discomfort and hinder the immersive VR experience. Here we investigated cybersickness in 360-degree head-mounted display VR. In traditional 360-degree VR experiences, translational movement in the real world is not reflected in the virtual world, and therefore self-motion information is not corroborated by matching visual and vestibular cues, which may trigger symptoms of cybersickness. We evaluated whether a new Artificial Intelligence (AI) software designed to supplement the 360-degree VR experience with artificial six-degrees-of-freedom motion may reduce cybersickness. Explicit (simulator sickness questionnaire and Fast Motion Sickness (FMS) rating) and implicit (heart rate) measurements were used to evaluate cybersickness symptoms during and after 360-degree VR exposure. Simulator sickness scores showed a significant reduction in feelings of nausea during the AI-supplemented six-degrees-of-freedom motion VR compared to traditional 360-degree VR. However, six-degrees-of-freedom motion VR did not reduce oculomotor or disorientation measures of sickness. No changes were observed in FMS and heart rate measures. Improving the congruency between visual and vestibular cues in 360-degree VR, as provided by the AI-supplemented six-degrees-of-freedom motion system considered, is essential for a more engaging, immersive and safe VR experience, which is critical for educational, cultural and entertainment applications.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques are starting to be used in IVF, in particular for selecting which embryos to transfer to the woman. AI has the potential to process complex data sets, to be better at identifying subtle but important patterns, and to be more objective than humans when evaluating embryos. However, a current review of the literature shows much work is still needed before AI can be ethically implemented for this purpose. No randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have been published, and the efficacy studies which exist demonstrate that algorithms can broadly differentiate well between 'good-' and 'poor-' quality embryos but not necessarily between embryos of similar quality, which is the actual clinical need. Almost universally, the AI models were opaque ('black-box') in that at least some part of the process was uninterpretable. This gives rise to a number of epistemic and ethical concerns, including problems with trust, the possibility of using algorithms that generalize poorly to different populations, adverse economic implications for IVF clinics, potential misrepresentation of patient values, broader societal implications, a responsibility gap in the case of poor selection choices and introduction of a more paternalistic decision-making process. Use of interpretable models, which are constrained so that a human can easily understand and explain them, could overcome these concerns. The contribution of AI to IVF is potentially significant, but we recommend that AI models used in this field should be interpretable, and rigorously evaluated with RCTs before implementation. We also recommend long-term follow-up of children born after AI for embryo selection, regulatory oversight for implementation, and public availability of data and code to enable research teams to independently reproduce and validate existing models.", "Objectives: To determine the effectiveness of computer-assisted cognitive rehabilitation and compare the patterns of cognitive function recovery occurring in both traumatic brain injury (TBI) and stroke. Methods: A total of 62 patients were finally enrolled, consisting of 30 with TBI and 32 with stroke. The patients received 30 sessions of computer-assisted cognitive rehabilitation (Comcog) five times per week. Each session lasted for 30 min. Before and immediately after cognitive rehabilitation, all patients were evaluated by computerized neuropsychological test (CNT), Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), and modified Barthel index (MBI). Results: We analyzed the differences between pre- and post-cognitive rehabilitation in each TBI and stroke group. Significant differences were observed in MMSE, MBI, and some CNT contents, including digit span forward, verbal learning, verbal learning delayed recall, visual span forward, visual span backward, visual learning, trail making test A and B, and intelligence quotient (IQ) in the TBI group (p < 0.05). In the stroke group, in addition to significant differences that appeared in the TBI group, additional significant differences in the digit span backward, visual learning delayed recall, auditory continuous performance test (CPT), visual CPT, and card sorting test. We compared the difference values at pre- and post-cognitive rehabilitation for cognitive recovery between the TBI and stroke groups. All contents, except the digital span forward, visual learning, word-color test, and MMSE, had greater mean values in the stroke group; and thus, statistically significant higher values were observed in the visual span forward and card sorting test (p < 0.05). Conclusion: Most evaluation results showed improvement and the evaluation between the TBI and stroke groups also showed significant differences in cognitive functions in addition to more CNT contents, which significantly change in the stroke group. The stroke group showed a high difference value in most CNT contents. Therefore, those with stroke in the focal brain region tend to have better cognitive function recovery after a computer-assisted cognitive rehabilitation than those with TBI, which could cause diffuse brain damage and post-injury inflammation.", "Indications of limited resection, such as segmentectomy, have recently been reported for patients with solid-predominant lung cancers \u22642\u2009cm. This study aims to identify unfavourable prognostic factors using three-dimensional imaging analysis with artificial intelligence (AI) technology.\nA total of 157 patients who had clinical N0 non-small cell lung cancer with a radiological size \u22642\u2009cm, and a consolidation tumour ratio > 0.5, who underwent anatomical lung resection between 2011 and 2017 were enrolled. To evaluate the three-dimensional structure, the ground-glass nodule/Solid Automatic Identification AI software Beta Version (AI software; Fujifilm Corporation, Japan) was used.\nMaximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) and solid-part volume measured by AI software (AI-SV) showed significant differences between the 139 patients with adenocarcinoma and the 18 patients with non-adenocarcinoma. Among the adenocarcinoma patients, 42 patients (30.2%) were found to be pathological upstaging. Multivariable analysis demonstrated that high SUVmax, high carcinoembryonic antigen level and high AI-SV were significant prognostic factors for recurrence-free survival (RFS; P\u2009<\u20090.05). The 5-year RFS was compared between patients with tumours showing high SUVmax and those showing low SUVmax (67.7% vs 95.4%, respectively, P\u2009<\u20090.001). The 5-year RFS was 91.0% in patients with small AI-SV and 68.1% in those with high AI-SV (P\u2009=\u20090.001).\nHigh AI-SV, high SUVmax and abnormal carcinoembryonic antigen level were unfavourable prognostic factors of patients with solid-predominant lung adenocarcinoma with a radiological size \u22642\u2009cm. Our results suggest that lobectomy should be preferred to segmentectomy for patients with these prognostic factors.", "Personalised medicine aims to find an individualized approach for each particular patient. Most factors used in current psychiatry, however, depend on the assessment made by the individual clinician and lack a higher degree of reliability. Precision medicine bases decisions on quantifiable indicators available thanks to the tremendous progress in science and technology facilitating the acquisition, processing and analysis of huge amounts of data. So far, psychiatry has not been benefiting enough from the advanced diagnostic technologies; nevertheless, we are witnessing the dawn of the era of precision psychiatry, starting with the gathering of sufficient amounts of data and its analysis by the means of artificial intelligence and machine learning. First results of this approach in psychiatry are available, which facilitate diagnosis assessment, course prediction, and appropriate treatment choice. These processes are often so complex and difficult to understand that they may resemble a \"black box\", which can slow down the acceptance of the results of this approach in clinical practice. Still, bringing precision medicine including psychiatry to standard clinical practice is a big challenge that can result in a completely new and transformative concept of health care. Such extensive changes naturally have both their supporters and opponents. This paper aims to familiarize clinically oriented physicians with precision psychiatry and to attract their attention to its recent developments. We cover the theoretical basis of precision medicine, its specifics in psychiatry, and provide examples of its use in the field of diagnostic assessment, course prediction, and appropriate treatment planning.", "Early detection of skin cancer is of critical importance to provide five year survival rates that approach 99%. By 2050, one out of five Americans by age 70 will develop some form of skin cancer. This will result in a projected rate of 50 million skin biopsies per year given the current rate of escalation. In addition, the ability to differentiate between pigmented lesions and melanomas has proven a diagnostic challenge. While dermoscopy and visual analysis are useful in identifying many skin lesions, additional non-invasive techniques are needed to assist in the analysis of difficult to diagnose skin tumors. To augment dermoscopy data, we have developed 3D maps based on physical biomarker characteristics of benign and cancerous lesions using vibrational optical coherence tomography (VOCT). 3D images based on quantitative physical data involving changes in cellular and fibrous tissue stiffness along with changes in vascular quality are used to map and evaluate different types of cancers. 3D tumor maps constructed using quantitative VOCT data and OCT images have been used to characterize the differences between melanoma and other lesions. These characteristics can be used to plan the excision of difficult lesions where extensive surgery may be needed to remove the entire tumor in one step. In addition, it is now possible to use dermoscopy and VOCT to non-invasively differentiate between different cancerous lesion types using measurements of the resonant frequency of new cellular and vascular peaks. Quantitative VOCT information along with dermoscopic findings can be collected and analyzed remotely using artificial intelligence to improve cancerous tissue diagnosis.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly used in medicine, but data on benign prostatic enlargement (BPE) management are lacking. This study aims to test the performance of several machine learning algorithms, in predicting clinical outcomes during BPE surgical management.\nClinical data were extracted from a prospectively collected database for 153 men with BPE, treated with transurethral resection (monopolar or bipolar) or vaporization of the prostate. Due to small sample size, we applied a method for increasing our dataset, Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE). The new dataset created with SMOTE has been expanded by 453 synthetic instances, in addition to the original 153. The WEKA Data Mining Software was used for constructing predictive models, while several appropriate statistical measures, like Correlation coefficient (R), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean-Squared Error (RMSE), were calculated with several supervised regression algorithms - techniques (Linear Regression, Multilayer Perceptron, SMOreg, k-Nearest Neighbors, Bagging, M5Rules, M5P - Pruned Model Tree, and Random forest).\nThe baseline characteristics of patients were extracted, with age, prostate volume, method of operation, baseline Qmax and baseline IPSS being used as independent variables. Using the Random Forest algorithm resulted in values of R, MAE, RMSE that indicate the ability of these models to better predict % Qmax increase. The Random Forest model also demonstrated the best results in R, MAE, RMSE for predicting % IPSS reduction.\nMachine Learning techniques can be used for making predictions regarding clinical outcomes of surgical BPRE management. Wider-scale validation studies are necessary to strengthen our results in choosing the best model.", "Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (NCRT) followed by surgery is the mainstay of treatment for patients with locally advanced rectal cancer. Based on baseline 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose ([18F]-FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT), a new artificial intelligence model using metric learning (ML) was introduced to predict responses to NCRT.\nThis study used the data of 236 patients with newly diagnosed rectal cancer; the data of 202 and 34 patients were for training and validation, respectively. All patients received pretreatment [18F]FDG-PET/CT, NCRT, and surgery. The treatment response was scored by Dworak tumor regression grade (TRG); TRG3 and TRG4 indicated favorable responses. The model employed ML combined with the Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection for dimensionality reduction. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed to assess the model's predictive performance.\nIn the training cohort, 115 patients (57%) achieved TRG3 or TRG4 responses. The area under the ROC curve was 0.96 for the prediction of a favorable response. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were 98.3%, 96.5%, and 97.5%, respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for the validation cohort were 95.0%, 100%, and 98.8%, respectively.\nThe new ML model presented herein was used to determined that baseline 18F[FDG]-PET/CT images could predict a favorable response to NCRT in patients with rectal cancer. External validation is required to verify the model's predictive value.", "High-quality colonoscopy is essential to prevent the occurrence of colorectal cancers. The data of colonoscopy are mainly stored in the form of images. Therefore, artificial intelligence-assisted colonoscopy based on medical images is not only a research hotspot, but also one of the effective auxiliary means to improve the detection rate of adenomas. This research has become the focus of medical institutions and scientific research departments and has important clinical and scientific research value.\nIn this paper, we propose a YOLOv5 model based on a self-attention mechanism for polyp target detection. This method uses the idea of regression, using the entire image as the input of the network and directly returning the target frame of this position in multiple positions of the image. In the feature extraction process, an attention mechanism is added to enhance the contribution of information-rich feature channels and weaken the interference of useless channels; Results: The experimental results show that the method can accurately identify polyp images, especially for the small polyps and the polyps with inconspicuous contrasts, and the detection speed is greatly improved compared with the comparison algorithm.\nThis study will be of great help in reducing the missed diagnosis of clinicians during endoscopy and treatment, and it is also of great significance to the development of clinicians' clinical work.", "Ganglion cysts are common soft tissue masses of the hand and wrist, and small size cysts are often hypoechoic. Thus, identifying them from ultrasonography is not an easy problem. In this paper, we propose an automatic segmentation method using two artificial intelligence algorithms in sequence. A density based unsupervised learning algorithm called DBSCAN is performed as a front-end and its result determines the number of clusters used in the Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) clustering algorithm for quantification of ganglion cyst object. In an experiment using 120 images, the proposed method shows a higher extraction rate (89.2%) and lower false positive rate compared with FCM when the ground truth is set as the human expert's decision. Such human-like behavior is more apparent when the size of the ganglion cyst is small that the quality of ultrasonography is often not very high. With this fully automatic segmentation method, the operator subjectivity that is highly dependent on the experience of the ultrasound examiner can be mitigated with high reliability.", "Neurodiagnostic investigation requirements are expanding for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes in children, especially in those with developmental delay/intellectual disability (DD/ID). Thus, determination of optimal sedatives to achieve successful sedation and immobility without further neurological compromise is important in children with DD/ID. The purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness and adverse reactions of chloral hydrate (CH) for brain magnetic resonance imaging (B-MRI) in children with DD/ID compared to those with normal intelligence (NI). We performed a retrospective chart review of children aged from 1 day to 12 years who required elective sedation using CH for B-MRI. About 730 cases (415 with DD/ID and 315 with NI) of CH sedation were conducted for B-MRI. Children with DD/ID showed a higher failure rate (22%) than did those with NI (6%); additional CH and prolonged sedation time were required. There was no difference in incidence of adverse reactions between DD/ID and NI groups (p = 0.338). Older or heavier children with DD/ID (p = 0.036 and p = 0.013, respectively), as well as those diagnosed with epilepsy or neuropsychiatric disorders showed higher risk of sedation failure (p < 0.001 for each). In conclusion, CH was a suboptimal sedative drug for children with DD/ID compared with those with NI. Other alternative or supplementary sedatives should be taken into consideration especially for those vulnerable groups.", "Our systematic review investigated the additional effect of artificial intelligence-based devices on human observers when diagnosing and/or detecting thoracic pathologies using different diagnostic imaging modalities, such as chest X-ray and CT. Peer-reviewed, original research articles from EMBASE, PubMed, Cochrane library, SCOPUS, and Web of Science were retrieved. Included articles were published within the last 20 years and used a device based on artificial intelligence (AI) technology to detect or diagnose pulmonary findings. The AI-based device had to be used in an observer test where the performance of human observers with and without addition of the device was measured as sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, AUC, or time spent on image reading. A total of 38 studies were included for final assessment. The quality assessment tool for diagnostic accuracy studies (QUADAS-2) was used for bias assessment. The average sensitivity increased from 67.8% to 74.6%; specificity from 82.2% to 85.4%; accuracy from 75.4% to 81.7%; and Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) from 0.75 to 0.80. Generally, a faster reading time was reported when radiologists were aided by AI-based devices. Our systematic review showed that performance generally improved for the physicians when assisted by AI-based devices compared to unaided interpretation.", "The high level of heterogeneity in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and the lack of systematic measurements complicate predicting outcomes of early intervention and the identification of better-tailored treatment programs. Computational phenotyping may assist therapists in monitoring child behavior through quantitative measures and personalizing the intervention based on individual characteristics; still, real-world behavioral analysis is an ongoing challenge. For this purpose, we designed EYE-C, a system based on OpenPose and Gaze360 for fine-grained analysis of eye-contact episodes in unconstrained therapist-child interactions via a single video camera. The model was validated on video data varying in resolution and setting, achieving promising performance. We further tested EYE-C on a clinical sample of 62 preschoolers with ASD for spectrum stratification based on eye-contact features and age. By unsupervised clustering, three distinct sub-groups were identified, differentiated by eye-contact dynamics and a specific clinical phenotype. Overall, this study highlights the potential of Artificial Intelligence in categorizing atypical behavior and providing translational solutions that might assist clinical practice.", "This study was concerned with how accurate people are in their knowledge of population norms and statistics concerning such things as the economic, health and religious status of a nation and how those estimates are related to their own demography (e.g age, sex), ideology (political and religious beliefs) and intelligence. Just over 600 adults were asked to make 25 population estimates for Great Britain, including religious (church/mosque attendance) and economic (income, state benefits, car/house ownership) factors as well as estimates like the number of gay people, immigrants, smokers etc. They were reasonably accurate for things like car ownership, criminal record, vegetarianism and voting but seriously overestimated numbers related to minorities such as the prevalence of gay people, muslims and people not born in the UK. Conversely there was a significant underestimation of people receiving state benefits, having a criminal record or a private health insurance. Correlations between select variables and magnitude and absolute accuracy showed religiousness and IQ most significant correlates. Religious people were less, and intelligent people more, accurate in their estimates. A factor analysis of the estimates revealed five interpretable factors. Regressions were calculated onto these factors and showed how these individual differences accounted for as much as 14% of the variance. Implications and limitations are acknowledged.", "(1) Background: COVID-19 computed tomography (CT) lung segmentation is critical for COVID lung severity diagnosis. Earlier proposed approaches during 2020-2021 were semiautomated or automated but not accurate, user-friendly, and industry-standard benchmarked. The proposed study compared the COVID Lung Image Analysis System, COVLIAS 1.0 (GBTI, Inc., and AtheroPointTM, Roseville, CA, USA, referred to as COVLIAS), against MedSeg, a web-based Artificial Intelligence (AI) segmentation tool, where COVLIAS uses hybrid deep learning (HDL) models for CT lung segmentation. (2) Materials and Methods: The proposed study used 5000 ITALIAN COVID-19 positive CT lung images collected from 72 patients (experimental data) that confirmed the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test. Two hybrid AI models from the COVLIAS system, namely, VGG-SegNet (HDL 1) and ResNet-SegNet (HDL 2), were used to segment the CT lungs. As part of the results, we compared both COVLIAS and MedSeg against two manual delineations (MD 1 and MD 2) using (i) Bland-Altman plots, (ii) Correlation coefficient (CC) plots, (iii) Receiver operating characteristic curve, and (iv) Figure of Merit and (v) visual overlays. A cohort of 500 CROATIA COVID-19 positive CT lung images (validation data) was used. A previously trained COVLIAS model was directly applied to the validation data (as part of Unseen-AI) to segment the CT lungs and compare them against MedSeg. (3) Result: For the experimental data, the four CCs between COVLIAS (HDL 1) vs. MD 1, COVLIAS (HDL 1) vs. MD 2, COVLIAS (HDL 2) vs. MD 1, and COVLIAS (HDL 2) vs. MD 2 were 0.96, 0.96, 0.96, and 0.96, respectively. The mean value of the COVLIAS system for the above four readings was 0.96. CC between MedSeg vs. MD 1 and MedSeg vs. MD 2 was 0.98 and 0.98, respectively. Both had a mean value of 0.98. On the validation data, the CC between COVLIAS (HDL 1) vs. MedSeg and COVLIAS (HDL 2) vs. MedSeg was 0.98 and 0.99, respectively. For the experimental data, the difference between the mean values for COVLIAS and MedSeg showed a difference of <2.5%, meeting the standard of equivalence. The average running times for COVLIAS and MedSeg on a single lung CT slice were ~4 s and ~10 s, respectively. (4) Conclusions: The performances of COVLIAS and MedSeg were similar. However, COVLIAS showed improved computing time over MedSeg.", "The early detection of carotid wall plaque is recommended in the prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in moderate-risk patients. Previous techniques for B-mode carotid atherosclerotic wall plaque segmentation used artificial intelligence (AI) methods on monoethnic databases, where training and testing are from the \"same\" ethnic group (\"Seen AI\"). Therefore, the versatility of the system is questionable. This is the first study of its kind that uses the \"Unseen AI\" paradigm where training and testing are from \"different\" ethnic groups. We hypothesized that deep learning (DL) models should perform in 10% proximity between \"Unseen AI\" and \"Seen AI\".\nTwo cohorts from multi-ethnic groups (330 Japanese and 300 Hong Kong (HK)) were used for the validation of our hypothesis. We used a four-layered UNet architecture for the segmentation of the atherosclerotic wall with low plaque. \"Unseen AI\" (training: Japanese, testing: HK or vice versa) and \"Seen AI\" experiments (single ethnicity or mixed ethnicity) were performed. Evaluation was conducted by measuring the wall plaque area. Statistical tests were conducted for its stability and reliability.\nWhen using the UNet DL architecture, the \"Unseen AI\" pair one (Training: 330 Japanese and Testing: 300 HK), the mean accuracy, dice-similarity, and correlation-coefficient were 98.55, 78.38, and 0.80 (p < 0.0001), respectively, while for \"Unseen AI\" pair two (Training: 300 HK and Testing: 330 Japanese), these were 98.67, 82.49, and 0.87 (p < 0.0001), respectively. Using \"Seen AI\", the same parameters were 99.01, 86.89 and 0.92 (p < 0.0001), respectively.\nWe demonstrated that \"Unseen AI\" was in close proximity (<10%) to \"Seen AI\", validating our DL model for low atherosclerotic wall plaque segmentation. The online system runs < 1 s.", "The differentiation-dedifferentiation hypothesis of general cognitive ability has been widely studied, but comparable research on crystallized intelligence is scarce. To close this gap, we conducted an empirical test of the age differentiation hypothesis of declarative knowledge as proposed in Cattell's investment theory, which predicts that knowledge differentiates into diverse forms after compulsory education ends. Thereto, a cross-sectional sample of 1,629 participants aged 18-70 years (M = 45.3) completed a comprehensive knowledge test comprising 120 broadly sampled questions from 12 knowledge domains, as well as a measure of openness/intellect. To investigate age-related differences in the level and structure of knowledge, we performed invariance tests in local structural equation models. The results did not provide any evidence for age-related differentiation of declarative knowledge but indicated age-related differences in the mean structure. Higher levels in openness/intellect were associated with higher levels in knowledge but not with more differentiated structure of knowledge. Contrary to predictions of the investment theory, our results suggest that declarative knowledge is age invariant across major parts of the adult lifespan.

The study involved 89 children from 3 to 15 years old; 57 children with similar upper limb motor disorders and 32 healthy children. Our results showed that motor disorders could impair cognitive functions, especially memory. In particular, we found that children between 8 and 11 years old with upper limb disorders differed significantly from their healthy peers in both auditory and visual memory scales. These results can be explained by the fact that the development of cognitive functions depends on the normal development of motor skills, and the developmental delay of motor skills affects cognitive functions. Correlation analysis did not reveal any significant relationship between other cognitive functions (attention, thinking, intelligence) and motor function. Altogether, these findings point to the need to adapt general habilitation programs for children with motor disorders, considering the cognitive impairment during their development. The evaluation of children with motor impairment is often limited to their motor dysfunction, leaving their cognitive development neglected. The current study showed the importance of cognitive issues for these children. Moreover, early intervention, particularly focused on memory, can prevent some of the accompanying difficulties in learning and daily life functioning of children with movement disorders.", "Fibrogenic processes instigate fatal chronic diseases leading to organ failure and death. Underlying biological processes involve induced massive deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM) by aberrant fibroblasts. We subjected diseased primary human lung fibroblasts to an advanced three-dimensional phenotypic high-content assay and screened a repurposing drug library of small molecules for inhibiting ECM deposition. Fibrotic Pattern Detection by Artificial Intelligence identified tranilast as an effective inhibitor. Structure-activity relationship studies confirmed N-(2-butoxyphenyl)-3-(phenyl)acrylamides (N23Ps) as a novel and highly potent compound class. N23Ps suppressed myofibroblast transdifferentiation, ECM deposition, cellular contractility, and altered cell shapes, thus advocating a unique mode of action. Mechanistically, transcriptomics identified SMURF2 as a potential therapeutic target network. Antifibrotic activity of N23Ps was verified by proteomics in a human ex vivo tissue fibrosis disease model, suppressing profibrotic markers SERPINE1 and CXCL8. Conclusively, N23Ps are a novel class of highly potent compounds inhibiting organ fibrosis in patients.", "Chuna manual therapy (CMT) is a type of manual medicine practiced by Korean medical doctors in South Korea. Spinal diagnosis in CMT uses a system that applies manual diagnostic and X-ray tests to detect specific vertebral malpositions, based on the relative alignment across vertebral bodies. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) programs have been developed to assist in the radiological diagnosis of CMT using X-ray images. Nevertheless, a few clinical studies have reported on the concordance between diagnosticians, diagnostics methodologies, and the use of AI programs for diagnosing CMT. At present, the evidence to support CMT diagnosis is insufficient. This study thus aims to overcome such limitations by collecting and comparing CMT diagnostic data from experts and non-experts through manual diagnosis, X-ray test, and images obtained using an AI program. The study aims to search for CMT diagnosis methods with more outstanding rationality and consistency and to explore the potential use of AI-based CMT diagnosis programs.\nThis study will be conducted as an exploratory, cross-sectional, prospective observational study that will recruit 100 non-specialist subjects. Each subject will submit a signed consent after the screening test and undergo L-spine standing AP & lateral X-ray imaging. Manual CMT diagnosis will be performed by 3 CMT experts according to the standard operation procedure (SOP). The X-ray images of the 100 subjects will subsequently be used to make the CMT radiological diagnoses according to the same SOP by the CMT expert group (n\u200a=\u200a3) and CMT non-expert group (n\u200a=\u200a3). Among the subjects, those in the non-expert group will receive another CMT radiological diagnosis with spinal data obtained using the AI program, approximately 1\u200amonth from after initial diagnosis.Based on the collected diagnostic data, within- and between-group concordance levels will be assessed for each diagnostic method. The verified level of concordance will be used to test the potential use of CMT diagnostic method and CMT AI programs with high levels of rationality and consistency.\nThis trial has received complete ethical approval from the Wonkwang University Korean Medicine Hospital (IRB 2021-8). We intend to submit the results of the trial to a peer-reviewed journal and/or conferences.\nhttps://cris.nih.go.kr/cris/search/detailSearch.do?search_lang=E&search_page=M&pageSize=10&page=undefined&seq=20613&status=5&seq_group=20613, Identifier: KCT0006707.", "According to the WHO Malaria Report 2019 a total of 229\u00a0million people fall ill with malaria each year and two thirds of deaths involve children under 5\u00a0years of age.\nTo review the fundus changes in the context of malaria and the importance of ophthalmoscopy in the diagnosis.\nSummary of changes in cerebral malaria visible on fundus examination, possible underlying pathomechanisms and the value of ophthalmoscopy in practice.\nRetinal findings in malaria include white or gray staining of the retina (retinal whitening), color change of retinal vessels (orange or white staining), hemorrhages often with a\u00a0white center, such as Roth's spot and papilledema.\nThe retinal changes in malaria are specific and may help to differentiate malaria from other causes of coma and fever.

At present, there are only a few clinically validated examples of AI applications in this field. This review focuses on the use of AI in paediatric cardiovascular MRI, using examples from paediatric cardiovascular MRI, adult cardiovascular MRI and other radiologic experience.", "The rapid emergence of the novel SARS-CoV-2 poses a challenge and has attracted worldwide attention. Artificial intelligence (AI) can be used to combat this pandemic and control the spread of the virus. In particular, deep learning-based time-series techniques are used to predict worldwide COVID-19 cases for short-term and medium-term dependencies using adaptive learning. This study aimed to predict daily COVID-19 cases and investigate the critical factors that increase the transmission rate of this outbreak by examining different influential factors. Furthermore, the study analyzed the effectiveness of COVID-19 prevention measures. A fully connected deep neural network, long short-term memory (LSTM), and transformer model were used as the AI models for the prediction of new COVID-19 cases. Initially, data preprocessing and feature extraction were performed using COVID-19 datasets from Saudi Arabia. The performance metrics for all models were computed, and the results were subjected to comparative analysis to detect the most reliable model. Additionally, statistical hypothesis analysis and correlation analysis were performed on the COVID-19 datasets by including features such as daily mobility, total cases, people fully vaccinated per hundred, weekly hospital admissions per million, intensive care unit patients, and new deaths per million. The results show that the LSTM algorithm had the highest accuracy of all the algorithms and an error of less than 2%. The findings of this study contribute to our understanding of COVID-19 containment. This study also provides insights into the prevention of future outbreaks.", "With the proliferation of non-linear loads in electricity supply industry, interests in improving quality of electrical supply have increased significantly. Power quality challenges have generated disputes between customers, network operators and equipment manufacturers globally. Identification of the sources of harmonics, and the quantification of the identified variables at the points of common coupling (PCC) pose challenges in the electricity supply industry. Critical in the determination of the harmonic contributions are data for harmonic distortions in phase currents and voltages, power factor, apparent power, active power, reactive power, and frequency. The data were obtained at the PCC between 5 different arc furnace steel plant and the transmission network. The data were captured at 33kV and 132kV voltage level at the steel plant PCC using a Circuitor AR6 power analyser connected through incoming voltage transformers (VTs) and current transformers (CTs). Histograms and cumulative probability distribution plots present the harmonic contents of the data. This data can be reused for artificial intelligence and machine learning application in real-time monitoring of state of health at the PCC and design of filter networks to mitigate harmonics.", "Intellectual giftedness is commonly associated with a high level of intellectual functioning, an identification process whereby individuals are labeled as gifted, and adjustments in schools such as grade skipping. During adolescence, all these factors are prone to reduce peer connectedness and school life satisfaction. The aim of the present study was to disentangle the effects of these factors in a sample of 492 sixth and 10th graders. We identified three subsamples based on different characteristics associated with giftedness: students previously identified as gifted (n\u00a0=\u00a066), students who scored in the top 10% on a general intelligence test (n\u00a0=\u00a049), and students who had skipped a grade (n\u00a0=\u00a057). Comparative analysis showed that none of these subsamples differed from their respective control groups on school life satisfaction. Students labeled as gifted reported a lower level of peer connectedness, and the latter's contribution to school life satisfaction was significantly stronger within this subsample. These results underscore the importance of social integration for adolescents identified as intellectually gifted and exclude grade skipping as a risk factor. Moreover, high intellectual level does not seem to impact either school life satisfaction or peer connectedness.", "Systematic reviews are the cornerstone of evidence-based medicine. However, systematic reviews are time consuming and there is growing demand to produce evidence more quickly, while maintaining robust methods. In recent years, artificial intelligence and active-machine learning (AML) have been implemented into several SR software applications. As some of the barriers to adoption of new technologies are the challenges in set-up and how best to use these technologies, we have provided different situations and considerations for knowledge synthesis teams to consider when using artificial intelligence and AML for title and abstract screening.\nWe retrospectively evaluated the implementation and performance of AML across a set of ten historically completed systematic reviews. Based upon the findings from this work and in consideration of the barriers we have encountered and navigated during the past 24\u2009months in using these tools prospectively in our research, we discussed and developed a series of practical recommendations for research teams to consider in seeking to implement AML tools for citation screening into their workflow.\nWe developed a seven-step framework and provide guidance for when and how to integrate artificial intelligence and AML into the title and abstract screening process. Steps include: (1) Consulting with Knowledge user/Expert Panel; (2) Developing the search strategy; (3) Preparing your review team; (4) Preparing your database; (5) Building the initial training set; (6) Ongoing screening; and (7) Truncating screening. During Step 6 and/or 7, you may also choose to optimize your team, by shifting some members to other review stages (e.g., full-text screening, data extraction).\nArtificial intelligence and, more specifically, AML are well-developed tools for title and abstract screening and can be integrated into the screening process in several ways. Regardless of the method chosen, transparent reporting of these methods is critical for future studies evaluating artificial intelligence and AML.", "Nonfullerene, a small molecular electron acceptor, has substantially improved the power conversion efficiency of organic photovoltaics (OPVs). However, the large structural freedom of \u03c0-conjugated polymers and molecules makes it difficult to explore with limited resources. Machine learning, which is based on rapidly growing artificial intelligence technology, is a high-throughput method to accelerate the speed of material design and process optimization; however, it suffers from limitations in terms of prediction accuracy, interpretability, data collection, and available data (particularly, experimental data). This recognition motivates the present Perspective, which focuses on utilizing the experimental data set for ML to efficiently aid OPV research. This Perspective discusses the trends in ML-OPV publications, the NFA category, and the effects of data size and explanatory variables (fingerprints or Mordred descriptors) on the prediction accuracy and explainability, which broadens the scope of ML and would be useful for the development of next-generation solar cell materials.", "To investigate the impact of computed tomography (CT)-based, artificial intelligence-driven waist skeletal muscle volume on survival outcomes in patients with endometrial cancer.\nWe retrospectively identified endometrial cancer patients who received primary surgical treatment between 2014 and 2018 and whose pre-treatment CT scans were available (n\u2009=\u2009385). Using an artificial intelligence-based tool, the skeletal muscle area (cm2) at the third lumbar vertebra (L3) and the skeletal muscle volume (cm3) at the waist level were measured. These values were converted to the L3 skeletal muscle index (SMI) and volumetric SMI by normalisation with body height. The relationships between L3, volumetric SMIs, and survival outcomes were evaluated.\nSetting 39.0 cm2/m2 of L3 SMI as cut-off value for sarcopenia, sarcopenia (<\u200939.0 cm2/m2, n\u2009=\u2009177) and non-sarcopenia (\u2265\u200939.0 cm2/m2, n\u2009=\u2009208) groups showed similar progression-free survival (PFS; p\u2009=\u20090.335) and overall survival (OS; p\u2009=\u20090.241). Using the median value, the low-volumetric SMI group (<\u2009206.0 cm3/m3, n\u2009=\u2009192) showed significantly worse PFS (3-year survival rate, 77.3% vs. 88.8%; p\u2009=\u20090.004) and OS (3-year survival rate, 92.8% vs. 99.4%; p\u2009=\u20090.003) than the high-volumetric SMI group (\u2265\u2009206.0 cm3/m3, n\u2009=\u2009193). In multivariate analyses adjusted for baseline body mass index and other factors, low-volumetric SMI was identified as an independent poor prognostic factor for PFS (adjusted HR, 1.762; 95% CI, 1.051-2.953; p\u2009=\u20090.032) and OS (adjusted HR, 5.964; 95% CI, 1.296-27.448; p\u2009=\u20090.022).\nWaist skeletal muscle volume might be a novel prognostic biomarker in patients with endometrial cancer. Assessing body composition before treatment can provide important prognostic information for such patients.", "Signal-averaged electrocardiography is a non-invasive, computerized technique that amplifies, filters, and averages cardiac electrical signals reducing contaminating noise to obtain a high-resolution record. The most widely used signal averaging (SA) method involves a bipolar X, Y, and Z orthogonal lead system. Information is limited regarding its application in the standard resting 12-lead ECG. A novel system combining a high-resolution 12-lead ECG (HR-ECG) registered by SA with advanced analysis tools is presented.\nOriginal programming of a commercially available signal-averaged HR-ECG device was modified, introducing more exhaustive electrocardiographic assessment instruments.\nUsing SA techniques and placing surface electrodes in the standard 12-lead ECG positions, a HR-ECG is acquired within a bandwidth of 0.25 to 262\u00a0Hz at a rate of 1000 samples per second. It is advisable to average at least 200\u00a0cycles, taking three to five minutes to record. The package includes different optional high-frequency filters, manual calipers, zoom/superimposing/amplification functions.\nThe main strength lies in obtaining a low noise HR-ECG with zooming capabilities without definition loss. Other potential advantages are the greater ease in performing high precision analysis and comparing different ECG leads simultaneously.\nThe primary limitation is the inability to document intermittent or dynamic electrocardiographic disorders because of averaging similar electrical cardiac cycles.\nAdding artificial intelligence and further refinements in the averaging process could lead to software upgrades.\nIntegrating HR-ECG, obtained through SA techniques, with novel advanced analysis tools can enhance the ability to detect electrocardiographic disorders of permanent expression expeditiously.", "Functional connectivity studies have demonstrated that creative thinking builds upon an interplay of multiple neural networks involving the cognitive control system. Theoretically, cognitive control has generally been discussed as the common basis underlying the positive relationship between creative thinking and intelligence. However, the literature still lacks a detailed investigation of the association patterns between cognitive control, the factors of creative thinking as measured by divergent thinking (DT) tasks, i.e., fluency and originality, and intelligence, both fluid and crystallized. In the present study, we explored these relationships at the behavioral and the neural level, based on N = 77 young adults. We focused on brain-signal complexity (BSC), parameterized by multi-scale entropy (MSE), as measured during a verbal DT and a cognitive control task. We demonstrated that MSE is a sensitive neural indicator of originality as well as inhibition. Then, we explore the relationships between MSE and factor scores indicating DT and intelligence. In a series of across-scalp analyses, we show that the overall MSE measured during a DT task, as well as MSE measured in cognitive control states, are associated with fluency and originality at specific scalp locations, but not with fluid and crystallized intelligence. The present explorative study broadens our understanding of the relationship between creative thinking, intelligence, and cognitive control from the perspective of BSC and has the potential to inspire future BSC-related theories of creative thinking.", "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is common in immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs) and it is predominately attributed to the interplay between chronic inflammation and traditional CVD risk factors. CVD has significant impact on the survival of patients with IMIDs as it is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Despite recommendations for monitoring and managing CVD in patients with IMIDs, the individual CVD risk assessment remains problematic as CVD risk calculators for the general population consistently underestimate the risk in patients with IMIDs. Application of new technologies utilizing artificial intelligence techniques have shown promising potential for tailoring predictive medicine to the individual patient, but further validation of their role in clinical decision-making is warranted. In the meantime, individuals with IMIDs should be encouraged to adopt behavioral interventions targeting at modifiable lifestyle CVD risk factors, whereas rheumatologists need to be well aware of the unfavorable effects of antirheumatic medication on various CVD risk factors and outcomes. In the current paper, we aim to provide an overview of current and emerging strategies for mitigating CVD risk in patients with IMIDs, based on a practical approach.", "Objective: To assess the performance of a novel deep learning (DL)-based artificial intelligence (AI) system in classifying computed tomography (CT) scans of pneumonia patients into different groups, as well as to present an effective clinically relevant machine learning (ML) system based on medical image identification and clinical feature interpretation to assist radiologists in triage and diagnosis. Methods: The 3,463 CT images of pneumonia used in this multi-center retrospective study were divided into four categories: bacterial pneumonia (n = 507), fungal pneumonia (n = 126), common viral pneumonia (n = 777), and COVID-19 (n = 2,053). We used DL methods based on images to distinguish pulmonary infections. A machine learning (ML) model for risk interpretation was developed using key imaging (learned from the DL methods) and clinical features. The algorithms were evaluated using the areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs). Results: The median AUC of DL models for differentiating pulmonary infection was 99.5% (COVID-19), 98.6% (viral pneumonia), 98.4% (bacterial pneumonia), 99.1% (fungal pneumonia), respectively. By combining chest CT results and clinical symptoms, the ML model performed well, with an AUC of 99.7% for SARS-CoV-2, 99.4% for common virus, 98.9% for bacteria, and 99.6% for fungus. Regarding clinical features interpreting, the model revealed distinctive CT characteristics associated with specific pneumonia: in COVID-19, ground-glass opacity (GGO) [92.5%; odds ratio (OR), 1.76; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.71-1.86]; larger lesions in the right upper lung (75.0%; OR, 1.12; 95% CI: 1.03-1.25) with viral pneumonia; older age (57.0 years \u00b1 14.2, OR, 1.84; 95% CI: 1.73-1.99) with bacterial pneumonia; and consolidation (95.8%, OR, 1.29; 95% CI: 1.05-1.40) with fungal pneumonia. Conclusion: For classifying common types of pneumonia and assessing the influential factors for triage, our AI system has shown promising results. Our ultimate goal is to assist clinicians in making quick and accurate diagnoses, resulting in the potential for early therapeutic intervention.", "Background: Antiarrhythmic drugs are the first-line treatment for atrial fibrillation (AF), but their effect is highly dependent on the characteristics of the patient. Moreover, anatomical variability, and specifically atrial size, have also a strong influence on AF recurrence. Objective: We performed a proof-of-concept study using artificial intelligence (AI) that enabled us to identify proarrhythmic profiles based on pattern identification from in silico simulations. Methods: A population of models consisting of 127 electrophysiological profiles with a variation of nine electrophysiological variables (G Na , I NaK , G K1, G CaL , G Kur , I KCa , [Na] ext , and [K] ext and diffusion) was simulated using the Koivumaki atrial model on square planes corresponding to a normal (16 cm2) and dilated (22.5 cm2) atrium. The simple pore channel equation was used for drug implementation including three drugs (isoproterenol, flecainide, and verapamil). We analyzed the effect of every ionic channel combination to evaluate arrhythmia induction. A Random Forest algorithm was trained using the population of models and AF inducibility as input and output, respectively. The algorithm was trained with 80% of the data (N = 832) and 20% of the data was used for testing with a k-fold cross-validation (k = 5). Results: We found two electrophysiological patterns derived from the AI algorithm that was associated with proarrhythmic behavior in most of the profiles, where G K1 was identified as the most important current for classifying the proarrhythmicity of a given profile. Additionally, we found different effects of the drugs depending on the electrophysiological profile and a higher tendency of the dilated tissue to fibrillate (Small tissue: 80 profiles vs Dilated tissue: 87 profiles). Conclusion: Artificial intelligence algorithms appear as a novel tool for electrophysiological pattern identification and analysis of the effect of antiarrhythmic drugs on a heterogeneous population of patients with AF.", "With the continuous deepening of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) research, ANN model structure and function are improving towards diversification and intelligence. However, the model is more evaluated from the pros and cons of the problem-solving results and the lack of evaluation from the biomimetic aspect of imitating neural networks is not inclusive enough. Hence, a new ANN models evaluation strategy is proposed from the perspective of bionics in response to this problem in the paper. Firstly, four classical neural network models are illustrated: Back Propagation (BP) network, Deep Belief Network (DBN), LeNet5 network, and olfactory bionic model (KIII model), and the neuron transmission mode and equation, network structure, and weight updating principle of the models are analyzed qualitatively. The analysis results show that the KIII model comes closer to the actual biological nervous system compared with other models, and the LeNet5 network simulates the nervous system in depth. Secondly, evaluation indexes of ANN are constructed from the perspective of bionics in this paper: small-world, synchronous, and chaotic characteristics. Finally, the network model is quantitatively analyzed by evaluation indexes from the perspective of bionics. The experimental results show that the DBN network, LeNet5 network, and BP network have synchronous characteristics. And the DBN network and LeNet5 network have certain chaotic characteristics, but there is still a certain distance between the three classical neural networks and actual biological neural networks. The KIII model has certain small-world characteristics in structure, and its network also exhibits synchronization characteristics and chaotic characteristics. Compared with the DBN network, LeNet5 network, and the BP network, the KIII model is closer to the real biological neural network.", "EUS-guided tissue acquisition carries certain risks from unnecessary needle puncture in the low-likelihood lesions. Artificial intelligence (AI) system may enable us to resolve these limitations. We aimed to assess the performance of AI-assisted diagnosis of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) by off-line evaluating the EUS images from different modes. The databases PubMed, EMBASE, SCOPUS, ISI, IEEE, and Association for Computing Machinery were systematically searched for relevant studies. The pooled sensitivity, specificity, diagnostic odds ratio (DOR), and summary receiver operating characteristic curve were estimated using R software. Of 369 publications, 8 studies with a total of 870 PDAC patients were included. The pooled sensitivity and specificity of AI-assisted EUS were 0.91 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.87-0.93) and 0.90 (95% CI, 0.79-0.96), respectively, with DOR of 81.6 (95% CI, 32.2-207.3), for diagnosis of PDAC. The area under the curve was 0.923. AI-assisted B-mode EUS had pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of 0.91, 0.90, 0.94, and 0.84, respectively; while AI-assisted contrast-enhanced EUS and AI-assisted EUS elastography had sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of 0.95, 0.95, 0.97, and 0.90; and 0.88, 0.83, 0.96 and 0.57, respectively. AI-assisted EUS has a high accuracy rate and may potentially enhance the performance of EUS by aiding the endosonographers to distinguish PDAC from other solid lesions. Validation of these findings in other independent cohorts and improvement of AI function as a real-time diagnosis to guide for tissue acquisition are warranted.", "Glaucomatous optic neuropathy is the leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide. Diagnosis and monitoring of disease involves integrating information from the clinical examination with subjective data from visual field testing and objective biometric data that includes pachymetry, corneal hysteresis, and optic nerve and retinal imaging. This intricate process is further complicated by the lack of clear definitions for the presence and progression of glaucomatous optic neuropathy, which makes it vulnerable to clinician interpretation error. Artificial intelligence (AI) and AI-enabled workflows have been proposed as a plausible solution. Applications derived from this field of computer science can improve the quality and robustness of insights obtained from clinical data that can enhance the clinician's approach to patient care. This review clarifies key terms and concepts used in AI literature, discusses the current advances of AI in glaucoma, elucidates the clinical advantages and challenges to implementing this technology, and highlights potential future applications.", "Assessing cancer response to therapeutic interventions has been realized as an important course to early predict curative efficacy and treatment outcomes due to tumor heterogeneity. Compared to the traditional invasive tissue biopsy method, molecular imaging techniques have fundamentally revolutionized the ability to evaluate cancer response in a spatiotemporal manner. The past few years has witnessed a paradigm shift on the efforts from manufacturing functional molecular imaging probes for seeing a tumor to a vantage stage of interpreting the tumor response during different treatments. This review is to stand by the current development of advanced imaging technologies aiming to predict the treatment response in cancer therapy. Special interest is placed on the systems that are able to provide rapid and noninvasive assessment of pharmacokinetic drug fates (e.g., drug distribution, release, and activation) and tumor microenvironment heterogeneity (e.g., tumor cells, macrophages, dendritic cells (DCs), T cells, and inflammatory cells). The current status, practical significance, and future challenges of the emerging artificial intelligence (AI) technology and machine learning in the applications of medical imaging fields is overviewed. Ultimately, the authors hope that this review is timely to spur research interest in molecular imaging and precision medicine.", "The launch in 2017 of the Irish 10-year reform programme Sl\u00e1intecare represents a key commitment in the future of the health system. An important component of the programme was the development of a health system performance assessment (HSPA) framework. In 2019, the Department of Health of Ireland (DoH) and Health Service Executive (HSE) commissioned the technical support of researchers to develop an outcome-oriented HSPA framework which should reflect the shared priorities of multiple stakeholders, including citizens. This study describes the method applied in the Irish context and reflects on the added value of using a citizen panel in the development of an HSPA framework.\nA panel of 15 citizens was convened, recruited by a third-party company using a sampling strategy to achieve a balanced mix representing the Irish society. Panellists received lay-language preparatory materials before the meeting. Panellists used a three-colour scheme to signal the importance of performance measures. An exit questionnaire was administered to understand how participants experienced being part of the panel. The citizen panel was the first in a series of three panels towards the development of the HSPA framework, followed by panels including representatives of the DoH and HSE, and representatives from professional associations and special interest groups.\nThe citizen panel generated 249 health performance measures ranging across 13 domains. Top-ranking domains to the citizen panel (people-centredness, coordination of care, and coverage) were less prioritized by the other panels; domains less prioritized by the citizen panel, such as accessibility, responsiveness, efficiency, and effectiveness, were of higher priority in the other panels. Citizen panellists shared a similar understanding of what a citizen panel involves and described their experience at the panel as enjoyable, interesting, and informative.\nThe priorities of the citizen panel were accounted for during all phases of developing the HSPA framework. This was possible by adopting an inclusive development process and by engaging citizens early on. Citizen engagement in HSPA development is essential for realizing citizen-driven healthcare system performance and generating trust and ownership in performance intelligence. Future research could expand the use of citizen panels to assess, monitor, and report on the performance of healthcare systems.", "Machine learning (ML), as a branch of artificial intelligence, acquires the potential and meaningful rules from the mass of data via diverse algorithms. Owing to all research of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) belonging to the digitalization of clinical records or experimental works, a massive and complex amount of data has become an inextricable part of the related studies. It is thus not surprising that ML approaches, as novel and efficient tools to mine the useful knowledge from data, have created inroads in a diversity of scopes of TCM over the past decade of years. However, by browsing lots of literature, we find that not all of the ML approaches perform well in the same field. Upon further consideration, we infer that the specificity may inhere between the ML approaches and their applied fields. This systematic review focuses its attention on the four categories of ML approaches and their eight application scopes in TCM. According to the function, ML approaches are classified into four categories, including classification, regression, clustering, and dimensionality reduction, and into 14 models as follows in more detail: support vector machine, least square-support vector machine, logistic regression, partial least squares regression, k-means clustering, hierarchical cluster analysis, artificial neural network, back propagation neural network, convolutional neural network, decision tree, random forest, principal component analysis, partial least squares-discriminant analysis, and orthogonal partial least squares-discriminant analysis. The eight common applied fields are divided into two parts: one for TCM, such as the diagnosis of diseases, the determination of syndromes, and the analysis of prescription, and the other for the related researches of Chinese herbal medicine, such as the quality control, the identification of geographic origins, the pharmacodynamic material basis, the medicinal properties, and the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. Additionally, this paper discusses the function and feature difference among ML approaches when they are applied to the corresponding fields via comparing their principles. The specificity of each approach to its applied fields has also been affirmed, whereby laying a foundation for subsequent studies applying ML approaches to TCM.", "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is associated with marked heterogeneity with respect to the development of executive function abilities. The bilingual advantage refers to the observation that individuals who speak two languages perform better on executive function tasks than monolinguals under some circumstances. There is not yet consensus, however, as to whether this advantage can be reliably demonstrated, nor is there consensus regarding under which conditions it emerges. Bilingual and monolingual children with ASD have comparable developmental outcomes, particularly in the areas of core ASD symptoms, cognitive function, and language. Still, despite the potential advantages that bilingualism may confer, clinicians commonly advise against providing a bilingual environment for children with ASD. The purpose of the present review is to provide an up-to-date assessment of the limited literature on bilingualism in children with ASD in order to inform evidence-based practice. Studies suggest a potential bilingual advantage in ASD in the areas of nonverbal intelligence quotient, adaptive functioning, and expressive vocabulary. A limited yet growing literature provides preliminary evidence for enhanced executive function ability in some children with ASD. Taken together, current evidence suggests that although a bilingual advantage may not be universally present in typical development, it may manifest under specific circumstances, conferring advantage for populations in which executive function is compromised. Further work is needed to develop consistent, evidence-based guidelines around language recommendations for families of children with ASD and to better understand the cognitive and brain mechanisms giving rise to the bilingual advantage in clinical developmental populations.", "Smartphones are used in cervical screening for visual inspection after acetic acid or Lugol's iodine (VIA/VILI) application to capture and share images to improve the sensitivity and interobserver variability of VIA/VILI. We undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis assessing the diagnostic accuracy of smartphone images of the cervix at the time of VIA/VILI (termed S-VIA) in the detection of precancerous lesions in women undergoing cervical screening.\nThis systematic review was conducted in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Studies from January 1, 2010, to June 30, 2020, were assessed. MEDLINE/PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane, and LILACS were searched. Cohort and cross-sectional studies were considered. S-VIA was compared with the reference standard of histopathology. We excluded studies where additional technology was added to the smartphone including artificial intelligence, enhanced visual assessment, and other algorithms to automatically diagnose precancerous lesions. The primary outcome was the accuracy of S-VIA for the diagnosis of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or greater (CIN 2+). Data were extracted, and we plotted the sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value, and positive predictive value of S-VIA using forest plots. This study was prospectively registered with The International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews:CRD42020204024.\nSix thousand three studies were screened, 71 full texts assessed, and eight studies met criteria for inclusion, with six included in the final meta-analysis. The sensitivity of S-VIA for the diagnosis of CIN 2+ was 74.56% (95% CI, 70.16 to 78.95; I2 61.30%), specificity was 61.75% (95% CI, 56.35 to 67.15; I2 95.00%), negative predictive value was 93.71% (95% CI, 92.81 to 94.61; I2 0%), and positive predictive value was 26.97% (95% CI, 24.13 to 29.81; I2 61.3%).\nOur results suggest that S-VIA has accuracy in the detection of CIN 2+ and may provide additional support to health care providers delivering care in low-resource settings.", "Secondary pulmonary tuberculosis (SPT) is one of the top ten causes of death from a single infectious agent. To recognize SPT more accurately, this paper proposes a novel artificial intelligence model, which uses Pseudo Zernike moment (PZM) as the feature extractor and deep stacked sparse autoencoder (DSSAE) as the classifier. In addition, 18-way data augmentation is employed to avoid overfitting. This model is abbreviated as PZM-DSSAE. The ten runs of 10-fold cross-validation show this model achieves a sensitivity of 93.33%\u2009\u00b1\u20091.47%, a specificity of 93.13%\u2009\u00b1\u20090.95%, a precision of 93.15%\u2009\u00b1\u20090.89%, an accuracy of 93.23%\u2009\u00b1\u20090.81%, and an F1 score of 93.23%\u2009\u00b1\u20090.83%. The area-under-curve reaches 0.9739. This PZM-DSSAE is superior to 5 state-of-the-art approaches.", "Cardiac arrest is a life-threatening cessation of activity in the heart. Early prediction of cardiac arrest is important, as it allows for the necessary measures to be taken to prevent or intervene during the onset. Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies and big data have been increasingly used to enhance the ability to predict and prepare for the patients at risk.\nThis study aims to explore the use of AI technology in predicting cardiac arrest as reported in the literature.\nA scoping review was conducted in line with the guidelines of the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) extension for scoping reviews. Scopus, ScienceDirect, Embase, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, and Google Scholar were searched to identify relevant studies. Backward reference list checks of the included studies were also conducted. Study selection and data extraction were independently conducted by 2 reviewers. Data extracted from the included studies were synthesized narratively.\nOut of 697 citations retrieved, 41 studies were included in the review, and 6 were added after backward citation checking. The included studies reported the use of AI in the prediction of cardiac arrest. Of the 47 studies, we were able to classify the approaches taken by the studies into 3 different categories: 26 (55%) studies predicted cardiac arrest by analyzing specific parameters or variables of the patients, whereas 16 (34%) studies developed an AI-based warning system. The remaining 11% (5/47) of studies focused on distinguishing patients at high risk of cardiac arrest from patients who were not at risk. Two studies focused on the pediatric population, and the rest focused on adults (45/47, 96%). Most of the studies used data sets with a size of <10,000 samples (32/47, 68%). Machine learning models were the most prominent branch of AI used in the prediction of cardiac arrest in the studies (38/47, 81%), and the most used algorithm was the neural network (23/47, 49%). K-fold cross-validation was the most used algorithm evaluation tool reported in the studies (24/47, 51%).\nAI is extensively used to predict cardiac arrest in different patient settings. Technology is expected to play an integral role in improving cardiac medicine. There is a need for more reviews to learn the obstacles to the implementation of AI technologies in clinical settings. Moreover, research focusing on how to best provide clinicians with support to understand, adapt, and implement this technology in their practice is also necessary.", "Informed consent is an indispensable condition of the clinical practice for the provision of health care. The main objective of this study is to translate the MacArthur competence assessment tool for treatment (MacCAT-T) into Turkish and evaluate the validity and reliability of the Turkish version in schizophrenia patients and healthy control subjects.\nIn this cross-sectional study, 30 hospitalized schizophrenia patients and 25 healthy subjects were assessed with MacCAT-T, Mental Competence Evaluation Form for Assessment of Competency (MCEF), Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, Beck Depression Inventory, Mini Mental State Examination, Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) - Similarities subtest and the Schedule for Assessing the Three Components of Insight. Psychometric properties of MacCAT-T were examined by intra-class correlation coefficients and Cronbach's alpha values.\nIntra-class correlations ranged between 0.83 and 0.99 for four subscales of the tool. Cronbach alpha value of MacCAT-T was found 0.89. Severity of psychopathology and indices of insight were found to be negatively correlated with the subscales of the tool. WAIS-Similarities subtest scores were found to be positively correlated with understanding and reasoning subscales of MacCAT-T.\nThe Turkish version of MacCAT-T is a valid and reliable instrument for Turkish patients. The severity of psychopathology, insight and executive functions were shown to be significantly related to the decision making capacity in patients with schizophrenia.", "This brief review introduces the reader to tensor network methods, a powerful theoretical and numerical paradigm spawning from condensed matter physics and quantum information science and increasingly exploited in different fields of research, from artificial intelligence to quantum chemistry. Here, we specialize our presentation on the application of loop-free tensor network methods to the study of high-energy physics problems and, in particular, to the study of lattice gauge theories where tensor networks can be applied in regimes where Monte Carlo methods are hindered by the sign problem. This article is part of the theme issue 'Quantum technologies in particle physics'.", "The concept of functional disability is aligned with the biopsycho-social model of disability. However, there are reasons why the antiquated measurement of medical impairment continues to be in use. We propose solutions for a fairer process using the International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health (ICF) at the level of the medical boards augmented by telemedicine and artificial intelligence (AI). The proposed technologies (Level 1 and Level 2 AI) need to be tried in pilot projects. It will accomplish two goals, the first being the measurement of disability and not merely the impairment. Second, and perhaps more importantly, making the process more transparent in creating a \"just\" society.", "The application of artificial intelligence (AI) not only yields in advantages for healthcare but raises several ethical questions. Extant research on ethical considerations of AI in digital health is quite sparse and a holistic overview is lacking. A systematic literature review searching across 853 peer-reviewed journals and conferences yielded in 50 relevant articles categorized in five major ethical principles: beneficence, non-maleficence, autonomy, justice, and explicability. The ethical landscape of AI in digital health is portrayed including a snapshot guiding future development. The status quo highlights potential areas with little empirical but required research. Less explored areas with remaining ethical questions are validated and guide scholars' efforts by outlining an overview of addressed ethical principles and intensity of studies including correlations. Practitioners understand novel questions AI raises eventually leading to properly regulated implementations and further comprehend that society is on its way from supporting technologies to autonomous decision-making systems.", "Several factors, including advances in computational algorithms, the availability of high-performance computing hardware, and the assembly of large community-based databases, have led to the extensive application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the biomedical domain for nearly 20\u00a0years. AI algorithms have attained expert-level performance in cancer research. However, only a few AI-based applications have been approved for use in the real world. Whether AI will eventually be capable of replacing medical experts has been a hot topic. In this article, we first summarize the cancer research status using AI in the past two decades, including the consensus on the procedure of AI based on an ideal paradigm and current efforts of the expertise and domain knowledge. Next, the available data of AI process in the biomedical domain are surveyed. Then, we review the methods and applications of AI in cancer clinical research categorized by the data types including radiographic imaging, cancer genome, medical records, drug information and biomedical literatures. At last, we discuss challenges in moving AI from theoretical research to real-world cancer research applications and the perspectives toward the future realization of AI participating cancer treatment.", "Protecting patients' privacy is one of the most important tasks when developing medical artificial intelligence models since medical data is the most sensitive personal data. To overcome this privacy protection issue, diverse privacy-preserving methods have been proposed. We proposed a novel method for privacy-preserving Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) inference model using privacy enhancing technologies including homomorphic encryption and secure two party computation. The proposed privacy-preserving GRU inference model validated on breast cancer recurrence prediction with 13,117 patients' medical data. Our method gives reliable prediction result (0.893 accuracy) compared to the normal GRU model (0.895 accuracy). Unlike other previous works, the experiment on real breast cancer data yields almost identical results for privacy-preserving and conventional cases. We also implement our algorithm to shows the realistic end-to-end encrypted breast cancer recurrence prediction.", "The use of artificial intelligence methods in the image-based diagnostic assessment of hematological diseases is a growing trend in recent years. In these methods, the selection of quantitative features that describe cytological characteristics plays a key role. They are expected to add objectivity and consistency among observers to the geometric, color, or texture variables that pathologists usually interpret from visual inspection. In a recent paper in The Journal of Pathology, El Hussein, Chen et al proposed an algorithmic procedure to assist pathologists in the diagnostic evaluation of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) progression using whole-slide image analysis of tissue samples. The core of the procedure was a set of quantitative descriptors (biomarkers) calculated from the segmentation of cell nuclei, which was performed using a convolutional neural network. These biomarkers were based on clinical practice and easily calculated with reproducible tools. They were used as input to a machine learning algorithm that provided classification in one of the stages of CLL progression. Works like this can contribute to the integration into the workflow of clinical laboratories of automated diagnostic systems based on the morphological analysis of histological slides and blood smears. \u00a9 2021 The Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.", "Flexible optoelectronics, as promising components hold shape-adaptive features and dynamic strain response under strain engineering for various intelligent applications. 2D materials with atomically thin layers are ideal for flexible optoelectronics because of their high flexibility and strain sensitivity. However, how the strain affects the performance of 2D materials-based flexible optoelectronics is confused due to their hypersensitive features to external strain changes. It is necessary to establish an evaluation system to comprehend the influence of the external strain on the intrinsic properties of 2D materials and the photoresponse performance of their flexible optoelectronics. Here, a focused review of strain engineering in 2D materials-based flexible optoelectronics is provided. The first attention is on the mechanical properties and the strain-engineered electronic properties of 2D semiconductors. An evaluation system with relatively comprehensive parameters in functionality and service capability is summarized to develop 2D materials-based flexible optoelectronics in practical application. Based on the parameters, some strategies to improve the functionality and service capability are proposed. Finally, combining with strain engineering in future intelligence devices, the challenges and future perspective developing 2D materials-based flexible optoelectronics are expounded.", "Emotional intelligence (EI) and assertiveness are key abilities for physiotherapists. Clinical placements seem to affect students' development of EI and assertiveness, and their construction of the professional role.\nThis study aims to compare the EI of physiotherapy students with students from other health professions and explore the evolution of EI and assertiveness in physiotherapy students throughout their university education, focusing on the influence of clinical practice.\nStudents (N\u00a0=\u00a0753) completed a self-administered questionnaire to measure emotional intelligence (TMMS 24), assertiveness (CSES), and sociodemographic variables.\nEI levels were adequate and very similar across the three disciplines. Regarding assertiveness, physiotherapy students in year 4 obtained significantly higher levels than students in years 1, 2, and 3. Significant correlations (rs (207)\u00a0=\u00a00.35, p <\u00a0.001) were found between assertiveness and the number of modules of clinical practice.\nThis study contributes with further evidence on the improvement of assertiveness in physiotherapy students through their university education and, in particular, with clinical placements. Practical implications highlight the importance of training in EI and assertiveness during university, coupled with clinical placements, in order to prepare for an effective and satisfactory professional life.", "We report an unknown taxon of bot fly (Diptera: Oestridae: Oestrinae) in red river hogs (Potamochoerus porcus Linnaeus, 1758) in Cross River State, Nigeria. From direct observation and interviews with local hunters, we document that, remarkably, the parasite typically occurs within the intracranial supra-meningeal space - i.e., between the inner wall of the skull and the brain - but without causing visible inflammation or clinical signs. The parasite is most similar (up to 87.9%) to Rhinoestrus usbekistanicus based on cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 DNA sequencing but is sufficiently divergent phylogenetically to represent a new or previously un-sequenced taxon. Morphologically, the parasite shares some, but not all, features with R. nivarleti. Local cultural belief systems attribute aspects of red river hog behavior (e.g. intelligence, elusiveness) to the parasite, suggesting a prolonged presence in the red river hog population. The parasite's unusual anatomic location may be aberrant, or it may be a protective adaptation to life in red river hogs, which forage vigorously with their snouts.", "Network interaction has evolved into a grouping paradigm as civilization has progressed and artificial intelligence technology has advanced. This network group model has quickly extended communication space, improved communication content, and tailored to the demands of netizens. The fast growth of the network community on campus can assist students in meeting a variety of communication needs and serve as a vital platform for their studies and daily lives. It is investigated how to extract opinion material from comment text. A strategy for extracting opinion attitude words and network opinion characteristic words from a single comment text is offered at a finer level. The development of a semiautonomous domain emotion dictionary generating technique improves the accuracy of opinion and attitude word extraction. This paper proposes a window-constrained Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic model that improves the accuracy of extracting network opinion feature words and ensures that network opinion feature words and opinion attitude words are synchronized by using the location information of opinion attitude words. The two-stage opinion leader mining approach and the linear threshold model based on user roles are the subjects of model simulation tests in this study. It is demonstrated that the two-stage opinion leader mining method suggested in this study can greatly reduce the running time while properly finding opinion leaders with stronger leadership by comparing the results with existing models. It also shows that the linear threshold model based on user roles proposed in this paper can effectively limit the total number of active users who are activated multiple times during the information diffusion process by distinguishing the effects of different user roles on the information diffusion process.", "This article discusses the usefulness of Toulmin's model of arguments as structuring an assessment of different types of wrongness in an argument. We discuss the usability of the model within a conversational agent that aims to support users to develop a good argument. Within the article, we present a study and the development of classifiers that identify the existence of structural components in a good argument, namely a claim, a warrant (underlying understanding), and evidence. Based on a dataset (three sub-datasets with 100, 1,026, 211 responses in each) in which users argue about the intelligence or non-intelligence of entities, we have developed classifiers for these components: The existence and direction (positive/negative) of claims can be detected a weighted average F1 score over all classes (positive/negative/unknown) of 0.91. The existence of a warrant (with warrant/without warrant) can be detected with a weighted F1 score over all classes of 0.88. The existence of evidence (with evidence/without evidence) can be detected with a weighted average F1 score of 0.80. We argue that these scores are high enough to be of use within a conditional dialogue structure based on Bloom's taxonomy of learning; and show by argument an example conditional dialogue structure that allows us to conduct coherent learning conversations. While in our described experiments, we show how Toulmin's model of arguments can be used to identify structural problems with argumentation, we also discuss how Toulmin's model of arguments could be used in conjunction with content-wise assessment of the correctness especially of the evidence component to identify more complex types of wrongness in arguments, where argument components are not well aligned. Owing to having progress in argument mining and conversational agents, the next challenges could be the developing agents that support learning argumentation. These agents could identify more complex type of wrongness in arguments that result from wrong connections between argumentation components.", "Synchronously detecting multiple Raman spectral signatures in two-dimensional/three-dimensional (2D/3D) hyperspectral Raman analysis is a daunting challenge. The underlying reasons notwithstanding the enormous volume of the data and also the complexities involved in the end-to-end Raman analytics pipeline: baseline removal, cosmic noise elimination, and extraction of trusted spectral signatures and abundance maps. Elimination of cosmic noise is the bottleneck in the entire Raman analytics pipeline. Unless this issue is addressed, the realization of autonomous Raman analytics is impractical. Here, we present a learner-predictor strategy-based \"automated hyperspectral Raman analysis framework\" to rapidly fingerprint the molecular variations in the hyperspectral 2D/3D Raman dataset. We introduce the spectrum angle mapper (SAM) technique to eradicate the cosmic noise from the hyperspectral Raman dataset. The learner-predictor strategy eludes the necessity of human inference, and analytics can be done in autonomous mode. The learner owns the ability to learn; it automatically eliminates the baseline and cosmic noise from the Raman dataset, extracts the predominant spectral signatures, and renders the respective abundance maps. In a nutshell, the learner precisely learned the spectral features space during the hyperspectral Raman analysis. Afterward, the learned spectral features space was translated into a neural network (LNN) model. In the predictor, machine-learned intelligence (LNN) is utilized to predict the alternate batch specimen's abundance maps in real time. The qualitative/quantitative evaluation of abundance maps implicitly lays the foundation for monitoring the offline/inline industrial qualitative/quantitative quality control (QA/QC) process. The present strategy is best suited for 2D/3D/four-dimensional (4D) hyperspectral Raman spectroscopic techniques. The proposed ML framework is intuitive because it obviates human intelligence, sophisticated computational hardware, and solely a personal computer is enough for the end-to-end pipeline.", "Artificial intelligence, and in particular deep learning using convolutional neural networks, has been used extensively for image classification and segmentation, including on medical images for diagnosis and prognosis prediction. Use in radiotherapy prognostic modelling is still limited, however, especially as applied to toxicity and tumour response prediction from radiation dose distributions. We review and summarise studies that applied deep learning to radiotherapy dose data, in particular studies that utilised full three-dimensional dose distributions. Ten papers have reported on deep learning models for outcome prediction utilising spatial dose information, whereas four studies used reduced dimensionality (dose volume histogram) information for prediction. Many of these studies suffer from the same issues that plagued early normal tissue complication probability modelling, including small, single-institutional patient cohorts, lack of external validation, poor data and model reporting, use of late toxicity data without taking time-to-event into account, and nearly exclusive focus on clinician-reported complications. They demonstrate, however, how radiation dose, imaging and clinical data may be technically integrated in convolutional neural networks-based models; and some studies explore how deep learning may help better understand spatial variation in radiosensitivity. In general, there are a number of issues specific to the intersection of radiotherapy outcome modelling and deep learning, for example translation of model developments into treatment plan optimisation, which will require further combined effort from the radiation oncology and artificial intelligence communities.", "Fabry disease (FD) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by glycosphingolipid accumulation and progressive damage across multiple organ systems. Due to its heterogeneous presentation, the condition is likely significantly underdiagnosed. Several approaches, including provider education efforts and newborn screening, have attempted to address underdiagnosis of FD across the age spectrum, with limited success. Artificial intelligence (AI) methods present another option for improving diagnosis. These methods isolate common health history patterns among patients using longitudinal real-world data, and can be particularly useful when patients experience nonspecific, heterogeneous symptoms over time. In this study, the performance of an AI tool in identifying patients with FD was analyzed. The tool was calibrated using de-identified health record data from a large cohort of nearly 5000 FD patients, and extracted phenotypic patterns from these records. The tool then used this FD pattern information to make individual-level estimates of FD in a testing dataset. Patterns were reviewed and confirmed with medical experts.\nThe AI tool demonstrated strong analytic performance in identifying FD patients. In out-of-sample testing, it achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.82. Strong performance was maintained when testing on male-only and female-only cohorts, with AUROCs of 0.83 and 0.82 respectively. The tool identified small segments of the population with greatly increased prevalence of FD: in the 1% of the population identified by the tool as at highest risk, FD was 23.9 times more prevalent than in the population overall. The AI algorithm used hundreds of phenotypic signals to make predictions and included both familiar symptoms associated with FD (e.g. renal manifestations) as well as less well-studied characteristics.\nThe AI tool analyzed in this study performed very well in identifying Fabry disease patients using structured medical history data. Performance was maintained in all-male and all-female cohorts, and the phenotypic manifestations of FD highlighted by the tool were reviewed and confirmed by clinical experts in the condition. The platform's analytic performance, transparency, and ability to generate predictions based on existing real-world health data may allow it to contribute to reducing persistent underdiagnosis of Fabry disease.", "Direct visual enumeration of viruses under dark-field microscope (DFM) using plasmon resonance probes (PRPs) is fast and convenient; however, it is greatly limited in the assay of real samples because of its inability to accurately identify false positives owing to non-specific adsorption. In this study, we propose an artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted DFM enumeration strategy for the accurate assay of Enterovirus A71 (an ultra-small human virus) using two PRPs; a 40\u00a0nm silver nanoparticle probe (SNP) that appears bright blue under DFM, and a 120\u00a0nm gold nanorod probe (GNP) that appears red under DFM. The capture chip was prepared by immobilizing the SNPs with antibodies on the glass to capture the target virus and to form dichromatic sandwich structures with the GNPs, followed by imaging under a dark field (DF). Subsequently, the DF images of the capture chip were subjected to a two-step screening: first, using image processing, and thereafter using the AI algorithm screening to eliminate false positive results and background noise. The results revealed that the data from the AI-assisted dual PRPs assay were highly consistent with those of quantitative PCR (qPCR), and that the sensitivity with a minimum detectable concentration of 3 copies/\u03bcL was 5 times higher than that of qPCR. The entire analysis was completed within 45\u00a0min. Therefore, our AI-assisted virus enumeration strategy with two DF PRPs holds great potential for ultra-sensitive and accurate quantification of viruses in real samples.", "Modern artificial intelligence techniques have solved some previously intractable problems and produced impressive results in selected medical domains. One of their drawbacks is that they often need very large amounts of data. Pre-existing datasets in the form of national cancer registries, image/genetic depositories and clinical datasets already exist and have been used for research. In theory, the combination of healthcare Big Data with modern, data-hungry artificial intelligence techniques should offer significant opportunities for artificial intelligence development, but this has not yet happened. Here we discuss some of the structural reasons for this, barriers preventing artificial intelligence from making full use of existing datasets, and make suggestions as to enable progress. To do this, we use the framework of the 6Vs of Big Data and the FAIR criteria for data sharing and availability (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reuse). We share our experience in navigating these barriers through The Brain Tumour Data Accelerator, a Brain Tumour Charity-supported initiative to integrate fragmented patient data into an enriched dataset. We conclude with some comments as to the limits of such approaches.", "How did grammar evolve? Perhaps a better way to ask the question is what kind of cognition is needed to enable grammar. The present analysis departs from the observation that linguistic communication is structured in terms of agents and patients, a reflection of how humans see the world. One way to explore the origins of cognitive skills in humans is to compare them with primates. A first approach has been to teach great apes linguistic systems to study their production in subsequent conversations. This literature has revealed considerable semantic competences in great apes, but no evidence for a corresponding grammatical ability, at least in production. No ape has ever created a sentence with an underlying causal structure of agency and patienthood. A second approach has been to study natural communication in primates and other animals. Here, there is intermittent evidence of compositionality, for example, a capacity to perform operations on semantic units, but again no evidence for an ability to refer to the causal structure of events. Future research will have to decide whether primates and other animals are simply unable to see the world as casually structured the way humans do, or whether they are just unable to communicate causal structures to others. This article is categorized under: Cognitive Biology > Evolutionary Roots of Cognition Computer Science and Robotics > Artificial Intelligence Linguistics > Evolution of Language.", "In past decades, the industrial and technological developments have increased exponentially and accompanied by non-judicial and un-sustainable utilization of non-renewable resources. At the same time, the environmental branch of toxicology has gained significant attention in understanding the effect of toxic chemicals on human health. Environmental toxic agents cause several diseases, particularly high risk among children, pregnant women, geriatrics and clinical patients. Since air pollution affects human health and results in increased morbidity and mortality increased the toxicological studies focusing on industrial air pollution absorbed by the common people. Therefore, it is needed to design an automated Environmental Toxicology based Air Pollution Monitoring System. To resolve the limitations of traditional monitoring system and to reduce the overall cost, this paper designs an IoT enabled Environmental Toxicology for Air Pollution Monitoring using Artificial Intelligence technique (ETAPM-AIT) to improve human health. The proposed ETAPM-AIT model includes a set of IoT based sensor array to sense eight pollutants namely NH3, CO, NO2, CH4, CO2, PM2.5, temperature and humidity. The sensor array measures the pollutant level and transmits it to the cloud server via gateways for analytic process. The proposed model aims to report the status of air quality in real time by using cloud server and sends an alarm in the presence of hazardous pollutants level in the air. For the classification of air pollutants and determining air quality, Artificial Algae Algorithm (AAA) based Elman Neural Network (ENN) model is used as a classifier, which predicts the air quality in the forthcoming time stamps. The AAA is applied as a parameter tuning technique to optimally determine the parameter values of the ENN model. In-order to examine the air quality monitoring performance of the proposed ETAPM-AIT model, an extensive set of simulation analysis is performed and the results are inspected in 5, 15, 30 and 60\u00a0min of duration respectively. The experimental outcome highlights the optimal performance of the proposed ETAPM-AIT model over the recent techniques.", "Bacterial keratitis (BK), a painful and fulminant bacterial infection of the cornea, is the most common type of vision-threatening infectious keratitis (IK). A rapid clinical diagnosis by an ophthalmologist may often help prevent BK patients from progression to corneal melting or even perforation, but many rural areas cannot afford an ophthalmologist. Thanks to the rapid development of deep learning (DL) algorithms, artificial intelligence via image could provide an immediate screening and recommendation for patients with red and painful eyes. Therefore, this study aims to elucidate the potentials of different DL algorithms for diagnosing BK via external eye photos. External eye photos of clinically suspected IK were consecutively collected from five referral centers. The candidate DL frameworks, including ResNet50, ResNeXt50, DenseNet121, SE-ResNet50, EfficientNets B0, B1, B2, and B3, were trained to recognize BK from the photo toward the target with the greatest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). Via five-cross validation, EfficientNet B3 showed the most excellent average AUROC, in which the average percentage of sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value was 74, 64, 77, and 61. There was no statistical difference in diagnostic accuracy and AUROC between any two of these DL frameworks. The diagnostic accuracy of these models (ranged from 69 to 72%) is comparable to that of the ophthalmologist (66% to 74%). Therefore, all these models are promising tools for diagnosing BK in first-line medical care units without ophthalmologists.", "Often likened to \"the new electricity,\" artificial intelligence (AI) has broad and sweeping impact in many areas. Perhaps most exciting among these are in bioinformatics as AI allows for new and increasingly powerful ways of understanding genomics, proteomics, and immunology, just to name a few areas. Also exciting is a parallel growth in high-throughput assays including sequencing which will further accelerate the development and use of AI in biomedicine. In this chapter, we will discuss artificial intelligence and deep leaning in particular, and we will review how such approaches are enhancing and even reshaping vaccine design in terms of epitope detection and optimization. Moreover, we discuss how AI is particularly valuable to the design of mRNA vaccines including in research and production. Finally, we will discuss several additional areas across trials and operations where AI will have pervasive impact on the development of vaccines going forward.", "Treatment planning of radiotherapy for locally advanced breast cancer patients can be a time consuming process. Artificial intelligence based treatment planning could be used as a tool to speed up this process and maintain plan quality consistency. The purpose of this study was to create treatment plans for locally advanced breast cancer patients using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).\nData of 60 patients treated for left-sided breast cancer was used with a training, validation and test split of 36/12/12, respectively. The in-house built CNN model was a hierarchically densely connected U-net (HD U-net). The inputs for the HD U-net were 2D distance maps of the relevant regions of interest. Dose predictions, generated by the HD U-net, were used for a mimicking algorithm in order to create clinically deliverable plans.\nDose predictions were generated by the HD U-net and mimicked using a commercial treatment planning system. The predicted plans fulfilling all clinical goals while showing small (\u22640.5\u00a0Gy) statistically significant differences (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) in the doses compared to the manual plans. The mimicked plans show statistically significant differences in the average doses for the heart and lung of \u22640.5\u00a0Gy and a reduced D2% of all PTVs. In total, ten of the twelve mimicked plans were clinically acceptable.\nWe created a CNN model which can generate clinically acceptable plans for left-sided locally advanced breast cancer patients. This model shows great potential to speed up the treatment planning process while maintaining consistent plan quality.", "Adenoma detection rate is the crucial parameter for colorectal cancer screening. Increasing the field of view with additional side optics has been reported to detect flat adenomas hidden behind folds. Furthermore, artificial intelligence (AI) has also recently been introduced to detect more adenomas. We therefore aimed to combine both technologies in a new prototypic colonoscopy concept.\nA 3-dimensional-printed cap including 2 microcameras was attached to a conventional endoscope. The prototype was applied in 8 gene-targeted pigs with mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli gene. The first 4 animals were used to train an AI system based on the images generated by microcameras. Thereafter, the conceptual prototype for detecting adenomas was tested in a further series of 4 pigs.\nUsing our prototype, we detected, with side optics, adenomas that might have been missed conventionally. Furthermore, the newly developed AI could detect, mark, and present adenomas visualized with side optics outside of the conventional field of view.\nCombining AI with side optics might help detect adenomas that otherwise might have been missed.", "Intelligent touch sensing is now becoming an essential part of various human-machine interactions and communication, including in touchpads, autonomous vehicles, and smart robotics. Usually, sensing of physical objects is enabled by applied force/pressure sensors; however, reported conventional tactile devices are not able to differentiate sharp and blunt objects, although sharp objects can cause unavoidable damage. Therefore, it is central issue to implement electronic devices that can classify sense of touch and simultaneously generate pain signals to avoid further potential damage from sharp objects. Here, concept of force-enabled nociceptive behavior is proposed and demonstrated using vanadium oxide-based artificial receptors. Specifically, versatile criteria of bio-nociceptor like threshold, relaxation, no adaptation, allodynia, and hyperalgesia behaviors are triggered by pointed force, but the device does not mimic any of these by the force applied by blunt objects; thus, the proposed device classifies the intent of touch. Further, supported by finite element simulation, the nanoscale dynamic is unambiguously revealed by conductive atomic force microscopy and results are attributed to the point force-triggered Mott transition, as also confirmed by temperature-dependent measurements. The reported features open a new avenue for developing mechano-nociceptors, which enable a high-level of artificial intelligence within the device to classify physical touch.", "Air pollution is the existence of atmospheric chemicals damaging the health of human beings and other living organisms or damaging the environment or resources. Rarely any common contaminants are smog, nicotine, mold, yeast, biogas, or carbon dioxide. The paper will primarily observe, visualize and anticipate pollution levels. In particular, three algorithms of Artificial Intelligence were used to create good forecasting models and a predictive AQI model for 4 distinct gases: carbon dioxide, sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, and atmospheric particulate matter. Thus, in this paper, the Air Qualification Index is developed utilizing Linear Regression, Support Vector Regression, and the Gradient Boosted Decision Tree GBDT Ensembles model over the next 5\u00a0h and analyzes air qualities using various sensors. The hypothesized artificial intelligence models are evaluated to the Root Mean Squares Error, Mean Squared Error and Mean absolute error, depending upon the performance measurements and a lower error value model is chosen. Based on the algorithm of the Artificial Intelligent System, the level of 5 air pollutants like CO2, SO2, NO2, PM 2.5 and PM10 can be predicted immediately by integrating the observations with errors. It may be used to detect air quality from distance in large cities and can assist lower the degree of environmental pollution.", "In settings without access to rapid expert radiographic interpretation, artificial intelligence (AI)-based chest radiograph (CXR) analysis can triage persons presenting with possible tuberculosis (TB) symptoms, to identify those who require additional microbiological testing. However, there is limited evidence of the cost-effectiveness of this technology as a triage tool.\nA decision analysis model was developed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of triage strategies with AI-based CXR analysis for patients presenting with symptoms suggestive of pulmonary TB in Karachi, Pakistan. These strategies were compared to the current standard of care using microbiological testing with smear microscopy or GeneXpert, without prior triage. Positive triage CXRs were considered to improve referral success for microbiologic testing, from 91% to 100% for eligible persons. Software diagnostic accuracy was based on a prospective field study in Karachi. Other inputs were obtained from the Pakistan TB Program. The analysis was conducted from the healthcare provider perspective, and costs were expressed in 2020 US dollars.\nCompared to upfront smear microscopy for all persons with presumptive TB, triage strategies with AI-based CXR analysis were projected to lower costs by 19%, from $23233 per 1000 persons, and avert 3%-4% disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), from 372 DALYs. Compared to upfront GeneXpert, AI-based triage strategies lowered projected costs by 37%, from $34346 and averted 4% additional DALYs, from 369 DALYs. Reinforced follow-up for persons with positive triage CXRs but negative microbiologic tests was particularly cost-effective.\nIn lower-resource settings, the addition of AI-based CXR triage before microbiologic testing for persons with possible TB symptoms can reduce costs, avert additional DALYs, and improve TB detection.", "Since the beginning of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, it has been clear that effective methods for the diagnosis of Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) are the key tools to control its epidemic. The current gold standard for diagnosing COVID-19 is the real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), which is a sensitive and specific method to detect SARS-CoV-2. Other RNA-based methods include RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), droplet digital reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (ddRT-PCR), reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP), and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR). The serological testing of antibodies (IgM and IgG), nanoparticle-based lateral-flow assay, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) can be used to enhance the detection sensitivity and accuracy. Because antibodies are usually detected a week after the onset of symptoms, these tests are used to assess the overall infection rate in the community. Sine the fact that healthcare varies from country to country across the world, different types of diagnosing COVID-19 imaging technologies including chest computed tomography (CT), chest radiography, and lung ultrasound are used in different degrees. Besides, the pooling test is an important public health tool to reduce cost and increase testing capacity in low-risk area, while artificial intelligence (AI) may aid to increase the diagnostic efficiency of imaging-based methods. Finally, depending on the type of samples and stages of the disease, a combination of information on patient demographics and histories, clinical symptoms, results of molecular and serological diagnostic tests, and imaging information is highly recommended to achieve adequate diagnosis of patients with COVID-19.", "Background: The work of health professionals often involves physical as well as psychological strain. They constantly deal with traumatic situations of pain and suffering, which destabilize the sense of well-being. Compassion fatigue is a feeling that appears in these cases and is related to other variables such as burnout or emotional drain. Aims: The principal aim of this project was to deepen the analysis of compassion fatigue and how it could be explained through the relationship with other constructs such as emotional intelligence and perceived health. Methods: This work followed the STROBE checklist for cross-sectional studies. In this study 1,521 nurses (M age  = 47.32; SD = 8.44) participated. The responses reported by the nurses were analyzed by classifying them as high or low compassion fatigue and the differences of both groups were analyzed for the variables of emotional intelligence, perceived health and quality of professional life. Results: It was obtained significant differences for all factors except for emotional intelligence factor. A linear regression analysis showed both emotional intelligence and perceived health helped to explain (12%) compassion fatigue. Conclusion: This study provides light on comprehending the conception of compassion fatigue. It highlights the importance of intervention programs that improve the quality of professional life.", "Technological development has enabled Artificial Intelligence (AI) to better support health care delivery and nursing. The need for nurses to be involved and steer the development and implementation of AI in health care is recognized. A 60-minute scientific debate is organized to explore if AI will replace nursing.", "Retrospective study of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).\nTo assess the ability of a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to differentiate osteoporotic vertebral fractures (OVFs) and malignant vertebral compression fractures (MVFs) using short-TI inversion recovery (STIR) and T1-weighted images (T1WI) and to compare it to the performance of three spine surgeons.\nDifferentiating between OVFs and MVFs is crucial for appropriate clinical staging and treatment planning. However, an accurate diagnosis is sometimes difficult. Recently, CNN modeling-an artificial intelligence technique-has gained popularity in the radiology field.\nWe enrolled 50 patients with OVFs and 47 patients with MVFs who underwent thoracolumbar MRI. Sagittal STIR images and sagittal T1WI were used to train and validate the CNN models. To assess the performance of the CNN, the receiver operating characteristic curve was plotted and the area under the curve was calculated. We also compared the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the diagnosis made by the CNN and three spine surgeons.\nThe area under the curve of receiver operating characteristic curves of the CNN based on STIR images and T1WI were 0.967 and 0.984, respectively. The CNN model based on STIR images showed a performance of 93.8% accuracy, 92.5% sensitivity, and 94.9% specificity. On the other hand, the CNN model based on T1WI showed a performance of 96.4% accuracy, 98.1% sensitivity, and 94.9% specificity. The accuracy and specificity of the CNN using both STIR and T1WI were statistically equal to or better than that of three spine surgeons. There were no significant differences in sensitivity based on both STIR images and T1WI between the CNN and spine surgeons.\nWe successfully differentiated OVFs and MVFs based on MRI with high accuracy using the CNN model, which was statistically equal or superior to that of the spine surgeons.Level of Evidence: 4.", "Radiomics, a subdomain of artificial intelligence, consists in extracting a large volume of data from all medical imaging techniques and correlating them with clinical data in order to build predictive and prognostic models. Radiomics is related to radiogenomics that correlates genetic mutations and molecular and biological characteristics of tissues with information extracted from medical imaging. Both are state-of-the-art fields of translational biomedical research. The ability to predict early patient survival and response to treatment, but also the capacity to identify tumor subtypes non-invasively, could make radiomics a key player with an essential role in personalized oncology. In head and neck cancer radiotherapy, radiomic algorithms can predict not only the response to radiochemotherapy or induction chemotherapy but also the need for planning through adaptive radiotherapy (ART). Radiomics can also predict the risk of severe toxicities, especially that of xerostomia. Given the benefit that a de-escalation of treatment can bring in selected cases to improve the quality of life, radiomics is expected to be part of the therapeutic decision for head and neck cancers in the near future, and may help identify cases where de-escalation of multimodal therapy will not jeopardize the therapeutic benefit.", "When children ask questions about science, parents use a variety of strategies to answer them, including providing accurate information, connecting to prior knowledge, or simply saying \"I do not know.\" This study examines the factors underlying individual differences in parental explanatory characteristics. Parents (N = 148; Mage = 38; 84% female, 16% male; 58% with White American children; 67% having completed college; 49% with household income over $75,000) of children ages 7 to 10 answered eight questions about biology as if they were responding to their child. They also completed three measures of different aspects of reasoning and values: the Picture Vocabulary Test (PVT) to measure verbal intelligence (Gershon et al., 2013), the Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT; Toplak et al., 2014), which measures the tendency to override intuitive but incorrect responses to engage in reflective thinking, and the Authoritarianism Scale (Feldman & Stenner, 1997), which measures a parent's preference for encouraging obedience toward authority figures over encouraging their child's autonomy. Our findings support that different factors are associated with different explanatory characteristics. Parents high in reflective thinking tend to provide more connections to other knowledge in their explanations, while parents high in authoritarianism tend to provide fewer references to uncertainty and how to manage it. Implications for effective parent-child communication and children's scientific understanding will be discussed.

There were 455 responses from 24 countries. Based on the findings NI research is evolving rapidly. Current ten most common trends include: clinical quality measures, clinical decision support, big data, artificial intelligence, care coordination, education and competencies, patient safety, mobile health, description of nursing practices and evaluation of patient outcomes. The findings help support the efforts to efficiently use resources in the promotion of health care activities, to support the development of informatics education and to grow NI as a profession.", "Our objective was to investigate brain structure, cerebral vasculature, and cognitive function in a cohort of patients with late-onset Pompe disease, with particular reference to the differences from those with the classic infantile phenotype, where extensive white-matter abnormalities (WMA) and impaired cognition on long-term enzyme treatment are reported in a subset of patients. Brain imaging (T1, T2, T2 fluid-attenuated inversion recovery, susceptibility-weighted images, and magnetic resonance angiography-time of flight) was combined with extensive cognitive testing of general intelligence (Wechsler IQ Test, Montreal Cognitive Assessment [MoCA]) and specific neuropsychological domains (verbal fluency, cognitive flexibility, attention, memory, and visuospatial abilities). We included 19 patients with late-onset Pompe disease (age range 11-56\u2009years). Two patients showed mild punctate WMA within normal range for age, with a Fazekas score (FS) of 1 to 2. Magnetic resonance angiography revealed a slight vertebrobasilar dolichoectasia in two patients yet did not show any aneurysms or vascular dissections. Most patients had age-adjusted scores within the normal range for the Wechsler index scores (verbal comprehension, perceptual reasoning, working memory, and processing speed) and combined total intelligence (IQ) score (median 101, interquartile range 91-111; one patient had a below-average score for total IQ) as well as for the specific domains verbal fluency, attention, and memory. A subset of patients performed suboptimally on the Rey Complex Figure Test (9/14 patients) or cube-copying/clock-drawing test of the MoCA (8/10 patients). We therefore concluded that our study showed no brain abnormalities, other than minor microvascular lesions considered within normal range for age, nor general cognitive impairment in late-onset Pompe patients. These findings are in sharp contrast with the widespread WMA and cognitive problems found in some classic infantile patients.", "Promoters are one of the most critical regulatory elements controlling metabolic pathways. However, the fast and accurate prediction of promoter strength remains challenging, leading to time- and labor-consuming promoter construction and characterization processes. This dilemma is caused by the lack of a big promoter library that has gradient strengths, broad dynamic ranges, and clear sequence profiles that can be used to train an artificial intelligence model of promoter strength prediction. To overcome this challenge, we constructed and characterized a mutant library of Trc promoters (Ptrc) using 83 rounds of mutation-construction-screening-characterization engineering cycles. After excluding invalid mutation sites, we established a synthetic promoter library that consisted of 3665 different variants, displaying an intensity range of more than two orders of magnitude. The strongest variant was \u223c69-fold stronger than the original Ptrc and 1.52-fold stronger than a 1 mM isopropyl-\u03b2-d-thiogalactoside-driven PT7 promoter, with an \u223c454-fold difference between the strongest and weakest expression levels. Using this synthetic promoter library, different machine learning models were built and optimized to explore the relationships between promoter sequences and transcriptional strength. Finally, our XgBoost model exhibited optimal performance, and we utilized this approach to precisely predict the strength of artificially designed promoter sequences (R2 = 0.88, mean absolute error = 0.15, and Pearson correlation coefficient = 0.94). Our work provides a powerful platform that enables the predictable tuning of promoters to achieve optimal transcriptional strength.", "Individual differences in music traits are heritable and correlated with the development of cognitive and communication skills, but little is known about whether diverse modes of music engagement (e.g., playing instruments vs. singing) reflect similar underlying genetic/environmental influences. Moreover, the biological etiology underlying the relationship between musicality and childhood language development is poorly understood. Here we explored genetic and environmental associations between music engagement and verbal ability in the Colorado Adoption/Twin Study of Lifespan behavioral development & cognitive aging (CATSLife). Adolescents (N = 1,684) completed measures of music engagement and intelligence at approximately age 12 and/or multiple tests of verbal ability at age 16. Structural equation models revealed that instrument engagement was highly heritable (a\u00b2 = .78), with moderate heritability of singing (a\u00b2 = .43) and dance engagement (a\u00b2 = .66). Adolescent self-reported instrument engagement (but not singing or dance engagement) was genetically correlated with age 12 verbal intelligence and still was associated with age 16 verbal ability, even when controlling for age 12 full-scale intelligence, providing evidence for a longitudinal relationship between music engagement and language beyond shared general cognitive processes. Together, these novel findings suggest that shared genetic influences in part accounts for phenotypic associations between music engagement and language, but there may also be some (weak) direct benefits of music engagement on later language abilities.

This study employed 3,3'-diaminobenzidine (DAB), a conventional color indicator for immunohistochemistry, as a novel high-sensitive scattering reagent to provide a multidimensional image signal varying with the overexpression rate of tumor markers. Based on the scattering properties of DAB aggregates, an efficient and robust artificial intelligence-aided immunohistochemical method based on dark-field imaging has been established, with improvement in both the imaging quality and interpretation efficiency in comparison with the conventional manual-operated immunohistochemical method. Referencing the diagnosis from three independent pathologists, this method succeeded in detecting HER2 overexpressed breast tumors with a sensitivity of 95.2% and a specificity of 100.0%; meanwhile, it was found to be applicable for non-small-cell lung tumors and malignant lymphoma as well. As demonstrated, this study provided an effective and reliable means for making diagnostic suggestions, which exhibited great potential in multiple tumor pathological detection at low cost.", "Machine learning (ML) has demonstrated promise in predicting mortality; however, understanding spatial variation in risk factor contributions to mortality rate requires explainability. We applied explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) on a stack-ensemble machine learning model framework to explore and visualize the spatial distribution of the contributions of known risk factors to lung and bronchus cancer (LBC) mortality rates in the conterminous United States. We used five base-learners-generalized linear model (GLM), random forest (RF), Gradient boosting machine (GBM), extreme Gradient boosting machine (XGBoost), and Deep Neural Network (DNN) for developing stack-ensemble models. Then we applied several model-agnostic approaches to interpret and visualize the stack ensemble model's output in global and local scales (at the county level). The stack ensemble generally performs better than all the base learners and three spatial regression models. A permutation-based feature importance technique ranked smoking prevalence as the most important predictor, followed by poverty and elevation. However, the impact of these risk factors on LBC mortality rates varies spatially. This is the first study to use ensemble machine learning with explainable algorithms to explore and visualize the spatial heterogeneity of the relationships between LBC mortality and risk factors in the contiguous USA.", "As in other areas, artificial intelligence (AI) is heavily promoted in different scientific fields, including chemistry. Although chemistry traditionally tends to be a conservative field and slower than others to adapt new concepts, AI is increasingly being investigated across chemical disciplines. In medicinal chemistry, supported by computer-aided drug design and cheminformatics, computational methods have long been employed to aid in the search for and optimization of active compounds. We are currently witnessing a multitude of AI-related publications in the medicinal-chemistry-relevant literature and anticipate that the numbers will further increase. Often, advances through AI promoted in such reports are difficult to reconcile or remain questionable, which hampers the acceptance of computational work in interdisciplinary environments. Herein we attempt to highlight selected investigations in which AI has shown promise to impact medicinal chemistry in areas such as compound design and synthesis.", "To assist with retinal vein occlusion (RVO) screening, artificial intelligence (AI) methods based on deep learning (DL) have been developed to alleviate the pressure experienced by ophthalmologists and discover and treat RVO as early as possible.\nA total of 8600 color fundus photographs (CFPs) were included for training, validation, and testing of disease recognition models and lesion segmentation models. Four disease recognition and four lesion segmentation models were established and compared. Finally, one disease recognition model and one lesion segmentation model were selected as superior. Additionally, 224 CFPs from 130 patients were included as an external test set to determine the abilities of the two selected models.\nUsing the Inception-v3 model for disease identification, the mean sensitivity, specificity, and F1 for the three disease types and normal CFPs were 0.93, 0.99, and 0.95, respectively, and the mean area under the curve (AUC) was 0.99. Using the DeepLab-v3 model for lesion segmentation, the mean sensitivity, specificity, and F1 for four lesion types (abnormally dilated and tortuous blood vessels, cotton-wool spots, flame-shaped hemorrhages, and hard exudates) were 0.74, 0.97, and 0.83, respectively.\nDL models show good performance when recognizing RVO and identifying lesions using CFPs. Because of the increasing number of RVO patients and increasing demand for trained ophthalmologists, DL models will be helpful for diagnosing RVO early in life and reducing vision impairment.", "The artificial intelligence algorithm was used to analyze the characteristics of computed tomography (CT) images before and after interventional treatment of children's lymphangioma. Retrospective analysis was performed, and 30 children with lymphangioma from the hospital were recruited as the study subjects. The ultrasound-guided bleomycin interventional therapy was adopted and applied to CT scanning through convolutional neural network (CNN). The CT imaging-related indicators before and after interventional therapy were detected, and feature analysis was performed. In addition, the CNN algorithm was adopted to segment the image of the tumor was clearer and more accurate. At the same time, the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of the CNN algorithm was 0.9, which had a higher degree of agreement. In terms of clinical symptoms, the cured children's lesions disappeared, the skin surface returned to normal color, and the treatment was smooth. In the two cases with effective treatment, the cystic mass at the lesion site was significantly smaller, and the nodules disappeared. CT images before interventional therapy showed that lymphangiomas in children were more common in the neck. The cystic masses at all lesion sites varied in diameter and size, and most of them were similar to round and irregular, with uniform density distribution. The boundary was clear, the cyst was solid, and there were different degrees of compression and spread to the surrounding structure. Most of them were polycystic, and a few of them were single cystic. After interventional treatment, CT images showed that 27 cases of cured children's lymphangioma completely disappeared. Lymphangioma was significantly reduced in two children with effective treatment. Edema around the tumor also decreased significantly. Patients who did not respond to the treatment received interventional treatment again, and the tumors disappeared completely on CT imaging. No recurrence or new occurrence was found in three-month follow-up. The total effective rate of interventional therapy for lymphangioma in children was 96.67%. The CNN algorithm can effectively compare the CT image features before and after interventional treatment for children's lymphangioma. It was suggested that the artificial intelligence algorithm-aided CT imaging examination was helpful to guide physicians in the accurate treatment of children's lymphangioma.", "The Novel Corona Virus 2019 has drastically affected millions of people all around the world and was a huge threat to the human race since its evolution in 2019. Chest CT images are considered to be one of the indicative sources for diagnosis of COVID-19 by most of the researchers in the research community. Several researchers have proposed various models for the prediction of COVID-19 using CT images using Artificial Intelligence based algorithms (Alimadadi e al., 2020 [19], Srinivasa Rao and Vazquez, 2020 [20], Vaishya et al., 2020 [21]). EfficientNet is one of the powerful Convolutional Neural Network models proposed by Tan and Le (2019). The objective of this study is to explore the effect of image enhancement algorithms such as Laplace transform, Wavelet transforms, Adaptive gamma correction and Contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE) on Chest CT images for the classification of Covid-19 using the EfficientNet algorithm. SARS- COV-2 (Soares et al., 2020) dataset is used in this study. The images were preprocessed and brightness augmented. The EfficientNet algorithm is implemented and the performance is evaluated by adding the four image enhancement algorithms. The CLAHE based EfficientNet model yielded an accuracy of 94.56%, precision of 95%, recall of 91%, and F1 of 93%. This study shows that adding a CLAHE image enhancement to the EfficientNet model improves the performance of the powerful Convolutional Neural Network model in classifying the CT images for Covid-19.", "With the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) and related technologies, AI algorithms are being embedded into various health information technologies that assist clinicians in clinical decision making.\nThis study aimed to explore how clinicians perceive AI assistance in diagnostic decision making and suggest the paths forward for AI-human teaming for clinical decision making in health care.\nThis study used a mixed methods approach, utilizing hierarchical linear modeling and sentiment analysis through natural language understanding techniques.\nA total of 114 clinicians participated in online simulation surveys in 2020 and 2021. These clinicians studied family medicine and used AI algorithms to aid in patient diagnosis. Their overall sentiment toward AI-assisted diagnosis was positive and comparable with diagnoses made without the assistance of AI. However, AI-guided decision making was not congruent with the way clinicians typically made decisions in diagnosing illnesses. In a quantitative survey, clinicians reported perceiving current AI assistance as not likely to enhance diagnostic capability and negatively influenced their overall performance (\u03b2=-0.421, P=.02). Instead, clinicians' diagnostic capabilities tended to be associated with well-known parameters, such as education, age, and daily habit of technology use on social media platforms.\nThis study elucidated clinicians' current perceptions and sentiments toward AI-enabled diagnosis. Although the sentiment was positive, the current form of AI assistance may not be linked with efficient decision making, as AI algorithms are not well aligned with subjective human reasoning in clinical diagnosis. Developers and policy makers in health could gather behavioral data from clinicians in various disciplines to help align AI algorithms with the unique subjective patterns of reasoning that humans employ in clinical diagnosis.", "Generating functional protein variants with novel or improved characteristics has been a goal of the biotechnology industry and life sciences, for decades. Rational design and directed evolution are two major pathways to achieve the desired ends. While rational protein design approach has made substantial progress, the idea of using a method based on cycles of mutagenesis and natural selection to develop novel binding proteins, enzymes and structures has attracted great attention. Laboratory evolution of proteins/enzymes requires new tools and analytical approaches to create genetic diversity and identifying variants with desired traits. In this pursuit, construction of sufficiently large libraries of target molecules to search for improved variants and the need for new protocols to alter the properties of target molecules has been a continuing challenge in the directed evolution experiments. This review will discuss the in vivo and in vitro gene diversification tools, library screening or selection approaches, and artificial intelligence/machine-learning-based strategies to mutagenesis developed in the last 40 years to accelerate the natural process of evolution in creating new functional protein variants, optimization of microbial strains, and transformation of enzymes into industrial machines. Analyzing patent position over these techniques and mechanisms also constitutes an integral and distinctive part of this review. The aim is to provide an up-to-date resource/technology toolbox for research-based and pharmaceutical companies to discover the boundaries of competitor's intellectual property (IP) portfolio, their freedom-to-operate in the relevant IP landscape, and the need for patent due diligence analysis to rule out whether use of a particular patented mutagenesis method, library screening/selection technique falls outside the safe harbor of experimental use exemption. While so doing, we have referred to some recent cases that emphasize the significance of selecting a suitable gene diversification strategy in directed evolution experiments.", "Purpose: To gauge the level of interest in breast imaging (BI) and determine factors impacting trainees' decision to pursue this subspecialty. Methods: Canadian radiology residents and medical students were surveyed from November 2020 to February 2021. Training level, actual vs preferred timing of breast rotations, fellowship choices, perceptions of BI, and how artificial intelligence (AI) will impact BI were collected. Chi-square, Fisher's exact tests and univariate logistic regression were performed to determine the impact of trainees' perceptions on interest in pursuing BI/women's imaging (WI) fellowships. Results: 157 responses from 80 radiology residents and 77 medical students were collected. The top 3 fellowship subspecialties desired by residents were BI/WI (36%), abdominal imaging (35%), and interventional radiology (25%). Twenty-five percent of the medical students were unsure due to lack of exposure. The most common reason that trainees found BI unappealing was repetitiveness (20%), which was associated with lack of interest in BI/WI fellowships (OR = 3.9, 95% CI: 1.6-9.5, P = .002). The most common reason residents found BI appealing was procedures (59%), which was associated with interest in BI/WI fellowships (OR, 3.2, 95% CI, 1.2-8.6, P = .02). Forty percent of residents reported an earlier start of their first breast rotation (PGY1-2) would affect their fellowship choice. Conclusion: This study assessed the current level of Canadian trainees' interest in BI and identified factors that influenced their decisions to pursue BI. Solutions for increased interest include earlier exposure to breast radiology and addressing inadequacies in residency training.", "To investigate the effect of age at pediatric arterial ischemic stroke on long-term cognitive outcome in order to identify patients particularly at risk for the development of long-term cognitive sequelae.\nThis cross-sectional study included patients in the chronic phase of stroke (>2 years after stroke) previously diagnosed with neonatal or childhood arterial ischemic stroke and a control group. Participants with active epilepsy, severe learning difficulties, or behavioral problems hindering the cognitive assessment were excluded. Several cognitive domains, including intelligence, executive functions (working memory, inhibition, and cognitive flexibility), processing speed, memory, letter fluency, and visual-motor skills were assessed with neuropsychological tests. Cognitive long-term outcome was compared across patients after neonatal stroke (stroke between 0 and 28 days of life), early childhood stroke (stroke between 29 days and <6 years), and late childhood stroke (stroke between \u22656 and <16 years).\nFifty-two patients after neonatal or childhood arterial ischemic stroke (median age 15.3 years, interquartile range [IQR] 10.6-18.7) and 49 healthy controls (median age 13.6 years, IQR 9.8-17.2) met the inclusion criteria. Cognitive outcome was significantly worse in the pediatric stroke group compared to the control group. A nonlinear effect of age at stroke (irrespective of lesion size and lesion location) was found for cognitive flexibility, processing speed, and verbal learning with early childhood stroke (29 days to <6 years), showing significantly worse cognitive outcome compared to neonatal or late childhood stroke (p < 0.05, false discovery rate-corrected).\nAge at stroke is an important factor for poststroke recovery and modulates long-term cognitive outcome irrespective of lesion size and lesion location. Children after early childhood stroke are at particular risk for long-term alterations in cognitive functions.", "To accelerate healthcare/genomic medicine research and facilitate quality improvement, researchers have started cross-institutional collaborations to use artificial intelligence on clinical/genomic data. However, there are real-world risks of incorrect models being submitted to the learning process, due to either unforeseen accidents or malicious intent. This may reduce the incentives for institutions to participate in the federated modeling consortium. Existing methods to deal with this \"model misconduct\" issue mainly focus on modifying the learning methods, and therefore are more specifically tied with the algorithm.\nIn this paper, we aim at solving the problem in an algorithm-agnostic way by (1) designing a simulator to generate various types of model misconduct, (2) developing a framework to detect the model misconducts, and (3) providing a generalizable approach to identify model misconducts for federated learning. We considered the following three categories: Plagiarism, Fabrication, and Falsification, and then developed a detection framework with three components: Auditing, Coefficient, and Performance detectors, with greedy parameter tuning.\nWe generated 10 types of misconducts from models learned on three datasets to evaluate our detection method. Our experiments showed high recall with low added computational cost. Our proposed detection method can best identify the misconduct on specific sites from any learning iteration, whereas it is more challenging to precisely detect misconducts for a specific site and at a specific iteration.\nWe anticipate our study can support the enhancement of the integrity and reliability of federated machine learning on genomic/healthcare data.", "Ethical artificial intelligence (AI) frameworks can be the catalyst in improving the safety and wellbeing of people when developing AI systems. In 2020 Rolls-Royce released its ethical and trustworthiness toolkit, The Aletheia FrameworkTM, which helps guide organisations as they consider the ethics around the use of AI. It covers three facets: social impact, accuracy and trust, and governance - which apply across all uses of AI. By adopting AI ethics and trust frameworks, oncologists can ensure the ratio between the benefit and harms of AI can be maximised. With AI transforming every sector, collaboration across industries to share ideas and learn from each other - even unlikely partnerships between engineering and oncology - could help optimise that transition.", "As information communication technology (ICT) has advanced, the healthcare industry has embraced it to reduce medical costs, improve health outcomes, and increase patient satisfaction. Healthcare ICT revolutionizes pediatric healthcare. This study aimed to categorize and synthesize findings from the literature regarding the application of ICT in pediatric patients. This systematic review is based on a comprehensive search of Embase, MEDLINE, and Google Scholar. Study selection and coding were performed independently by 2 researchers, followed by narrative categorization. To reflect current trends in ICT for pediatrics, we adopted the Hype cycle technology classification developed by the advisory and information technology firm, Gartner, and the classification of digital health interventions by the World Health Organization. This study included a total of 135 studies. The analysis revealed 7 main types of ICT for pediatrics: (1) telehealth (39 papers), (2) precision medicine (2 papers), (3) automated decision support systems (17 papers), (4) electronic health records (7 papers), (5) patient portals (7 papers), (6) artificial intelligence (AI) (39 papers), and (7) mobile and wearable technologies (20 papers). In particular, we consistently found references to ICT for pediatrics as well as changing and improving healthcare for children. Further studies are required to determine how we can improve ICT productivity for pediatrics, particularly through AI. This study's results will help healthcare delivery organizations and technology companies consider the future direction of pediatric healthcare.", "College students are taken as the research sample, with the purpose of exploring the characteristics of physical exercise and health education path of students under artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm. First, related literature is studied to understand the physical education system of college students. Then, the current situation of physical exercise of college students is investigated through the interview survey, and the mathematical statistics method is used to analyze the survey results. Moreover, the necessity and paths to carry out health education are discussed through the analysis of the physical exercise behavior of college students. Finally, the college smart sports classroom (SSC) is constructed using AI and the big data analysis method. The experimental results indicate that more than 50% of college students can actively participate in physical exercise. Besides, boys are more likely to take dangerous coping behaviors, while girls are more prone to choose to resist coping behaviors. In addition, there is little difference in age of the distribution of different coping behaviors in physical exercise. Freshmen are more inclined to take risky coping behaviors, and the quantity of students taking resistant coping behaviors increases with the increase of grades. Therefore, relevant physical health education for college students can promote the good habit of health exercise. This study can provide a reliable experimental basis for the development of sports education in the future.", "Although computer-aided detection (CAD) software employed with Artificial Intelligence (AI) system has been developed aiming to assist tuberculosis (TB) triage, screening, and diagnosis, its clinical performance for tuberculosis screening remains unknown.\nTo evaluate performance of an CAD software for detecting TB on chest X-ray images at a pilot active TB screening project.\nA CAD software scheme employed with AI was used to screen chest X-ray images of participants and produce probability scores of cases being positive for TB. CAD-generated TB detection scores were compared with on-site and senior radiologists via several performance evaluation indices including area under the ROC curves (AUC), specificity, sensitive, and positive predict value. Pycharm CE and SPSS statistics software packages were used for data analysis.\nAmong 2,543 participants, eight TB patients were identified from this screening pilot program. The AI-based CAD system outperformed the onsite (AUC\u200a=\u200a0.740) and senior radiologists (AUC\u200a=\u200a0.805) either using thresholds of 30% (AUC\u200a=\u200a0.978) and 50% (AUC\u200a=\u200a0.859) when taking the final diagnosis as the ground truth.\nThe AI-based CAD software successfully detects all TB patients as identified from this study at a threshold of 30%. It demonstrates feasibility and easy accessibility to carry out large scale TB screening using this CAD software equipped in medical vans with chest X-ray imaging machine.", "The field of vascular surgery is constantly evolving and is unsurpassed in its innovation and adoption of new technologies. Endovascular therapy has fundamentally changed the treatment paradigms for aneurysm and occlusive disease. As we continue to make advances in not only endovascular therapy, but also robotic surgery, artificial intelligence, and minimally invasive surgery, it is important that the vascular community stay at the forefront. Topics include the advantages of laparoscopic and robotic surgery over open surgery for aortic procedures, robotic versus laparoscopic aortic surgery, patient candidacy for robotic-assisted aortic surgery, and how to increase training and adoption of robotic-assisted laparoscopic aortic surgery. Future growth includes the development of new platforms and technologies, creation and validation of curriculum and virtual simulators, and conduction of randomized clinical trials to determine the best applications of robotics in vascular surgery.", "Steady progress over four decades toward understanding the pathogenesis and clinical consequences of hepatic fibrosis has led to the expectation of effective antifibrotic drugs, yet none has been approved. Thus, an assessment of the field is timely, to clarify priorities and accelerate progress. Here, we highlight the successes to date but, more importantly, identify gaps and unmet needs, both experimentally and clinically. These include the need to better define cell-cell interactions and etiology-specific elements of fibrogenesis and their link to disease-specific drivers of portal hypertension. Success in treating viral hepatitis has revealed the remarkable capacity of the liver to degrade scar in reversing fibrosis, yet we know little of the mechanisms underlying this response. Thus, there is an exigent need to clarify the cellular and molecular mechanisms of fibrosis regression in order for therapeutics to mimic the liver's endogenous capacity. Better refined and more predictive in vitro and animal models will hasten drug development. From a clinical perspective, current diagnostics are improving but not always biologically plausible or sufficiently accurate to supplant biopsy. More urgently, digital pathology methods that leverage machine learning and artificial intelligence must be validated in order to capture more prognostic information from liver biopsies and better quantify the response to therapies. For more refined treatment of NASH, orthogonal approaches that integrate genetic, clinical, and pathological data sets may yield treatments for specific subphenotypes of the disease. Collectively, these and other advances will strengthen and streamline clinical trials and better link histologic responses to clinical outcomes.", "The current study aimed to evaluate policies and actions for food environments by the Japanese Government using the Healthy Food Environment Policy Index (Food-EPI).\nPublic health experts rated the extent of implementation of food environment-related Policy and the Infrastructure-support components, compared with international best practices. Subsequently, the experts proposed and prioritised future actions to address implementation gaps in an online workshop.\nJapan.\nA total of sixty-six experts rated policy implementation by the Japanese Government and twenty-three participated in the workshop on future actions.\nThe implementations of regulations on unhealthy foods and non-alcoholic beverages were rated low in the domains of Food composition, Food labelling and Food promotion, Food prices and Food retail in the Policy component. The implementations of several domains in the Infrastructure-support component were, overall, rated at a higher level, specifically for monitoring and intelligence systems. Based on the rating, reducing health inequalities by supporting people, both economically and physically, was the highest priority for future actions in both components.\nThe current study found that Japan has a robust system for long-term monitoring of population health but lacks regulations on unhealthy foods and non-alcoholic beverages compared with international best practices. The current study confirmed the importance of continuous accumulation of evidence through national monitoring systems. Developing comprehensive regulations to restrict food marketing, sales and accessibility of unhealthy foods and non-alcoholic beverages is needed to improve the health of food environments in Japan.", "Vascular anastomoses typically involve a handsewn technique requiring significant surgical training, expertise, and time. The aim of our systematic review was to identify and describe sutureless vascular anastomosis techniques. We performed a systematic review of all sutureless vascular anastomosis technologies published in MEDLINE, PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane, Web of Science, and Scopus Library databases and a patent review using US Patent and Trade Office Application, US Patent and Trademark Office Patent, Google Patents, Lens, Patent Quality Through Artificial Intelligence, SureChEMBL, and E-Space Net. Data from inclusion studies and patents published between January 1, 1980 and July 15, 2021 were abstracted to describe their category, anastomosis type and configuration, study types, and advantages and disadvantages encountered with each technology. Two hundred eleven original studies and 475 patents describing sutureless vascular anastomosis technologies were identified. In the literature, stents/stent-grafts/grafts (n\u202f=\u202f61), lasers (n\u202f=\u202f53), and couplers (n\u202f=\u202f27) were the predominant device categories. In the patent review, adhesive technologies (n\u202f=\u202f103), stents/stent-grafts/grafts (n\u202f=\u202f68), and mechanical connectors (n\u202f=\u202f61) predominated. The majority of studies involved in vivo animal studies (n\u202f=\u202f193); 32.2% (n\u202f=\u202f68) of investigations involved human trials; and 17.9% (n\u202f=\u202f85) of patent technologies were approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. The main advantages described for sutureless anastomosis technologies included faster procedure time and greater patency rates compared with handsewn anastomoses. The main disadvantages included reduced vessel compliance, stenosis, leakage, and device costs. The appeal of sutureless technology is substantiated by numerous animal trials, but their use in humans remains limited. This may be a reflection of strict regulatory criteria and/or vascular complications associated with currently available technologies.", "Recent advances in artificial intelligence with traditional machine learning algorithms and deep learning architectures solve complex classification problems. This work presents the performance of different artificial intelligence models to classify two-phase flow patterns, showing the best alternatives for this specific classification problem using two-phase flow regimes (liquid and gas) in pipes. Flow patterns are affected by physical variables such as superficial velocity, viscosity, density, and superficial tension. They also depend on the construction characteristics of the pipe, such as the angle of inclination and the diameter. We selected 12 databases (9,029 samples) to train and test machine learning models, considering these variables that influence the flow patterns. The primary dataset is Shoham (1982), containing 5,675 samples with six different flow patterns. An extensive set of metrics validated the results obtained. The most relevant characteristics for training the models using Shoham (1982) dataset are gas and liquid superficial velocities, angle of inclination, and diameter. Regarding the algorithms, the Extra Trees model classifies the flow patterns with the highest degree of fidelity, achieving an accuracy of 98.8%.", "Applications of deep learning and other artificial intelligence techniques play an increasing role in pathological research. In contrast to research, applications in clinical routine are rare so far, although the first certified solutions have already been established (analysis of prostate sections, ER, PR, and Her2 in breast cancer). Besides the still low use of virtual microscopy in practice, there are a\u00a0number of hurdles that stand in the way of a\u00a0rapid diffusion of AI applications. The EMPAIA project has a goal of removing these hurdles. The path taken to build an ecosystem for this purpose is intended to exemplify that the introduction of AI applications in image-based diagnostics is possible on a\u00a0broad basis if the existing hurdles are removed in a\u00a0joint, moderated process. The components of the EMPAIA ecosystem and its strategy will be described, and reference will be made to the technical solution approaches.\nAnwendungen von Deep Learning und anderen Verfahren der k\u00fcnstlichen Intelligenz spielen eine zunehmende Rolle in der Pathologieforschung. Im Gegensatz zur Forschung sind Anwendungen in der klinischen Routine bisher selten, obwohl es bereits erste zertifizierte L\u00f6sungen (Analyse von Prostatagewebe oder ER, PR, Her2 bei Brustkrebs) gibt. Neben der noch geringen Nutzung der virtuellen Mikroskopie in der Praxis gibt es eine Reihe von H\u00fcrden, die einer schnellen Verbreitung von KI-Anwendungen im Weg steht. Das EMPAIA-Projekt hat sich zum Ziel gesetzt, diese H\u00fcrden zu beseitigen.

This review briefly discusses the common diagnostic methods, the use of artificial intelligence (AI) as a diagnostic tool in dermatology as a whole, and then examines research on the use of AI for diagnosing onychomycosis. The studies discussed implemented convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to examine datasets of images of entire nails or histological images and then used the information learned from those datasets to make a diagnostic decision of onychomycosis or not.\nResults: It was found that, on average, AI were able to diagnose onychomycosis from the images provided at an equivalent level as human dermatologists. However, there are a number of clear limitations for using AI in this manner. The AI models implemented relied solely on images and therefore were limited by image quality. As only images were examined, other clinical data were not taken into consideration, which could be important to the diagnostic outcome.\nConclusion: In conclusion, although AI can be a very helpful tool in the diagnostic process by increasing efficiency and reducing costs, it still requires the precision and expertise of professional dermatologists to be used optimally.", "Advances in voice recognition, natural language processing, and artificial intelligence have led to the increasing availability and use of conversational agents (chatbots) in different settings. Chatbots are systems that mimic human dialogue interaction through text or voice. This paper describes a series of design considerations for integrating chatbots interfaces with health services. The present paper is part of ongoing work that explores the overall implementation of chatbots in the healthcare context. The findings have been created using a research through design process, combining (1) literature survey of existing body of knowledge on designing chatbots, (2) analysis on state-of-the-practice in using chatbots as service interfaces, and (3) generative process of designing a chatbot interface for depression screening. In this paper we describe considerations that would be useful for the design of a chatbot for a healthcare context.", "While active efforts are advancing medical artificial intelligence (AI) model development and clinical translation, safety issues of the AI models emerge, but little research has been done. We perform a study to investigate the behaviors of an AI diagnosis model under adversarial images generated by Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) models and to evaluate the effects on human experts when visually identifying potential adversarial images. Our GAN model makes intentional modifications to the diagnosis-sensitive contents of mammogram images in deep learning-based computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) of breast cancer. In our experiments the adversarial samples fool the AI-CAD model to output a wrong diagnosis on 69.1% of the cases that are initially correctly classified by the AI-CAD model. Five breast imaging radiologists visually identify 29%-71% of the adversarial samples. Our study suggests an imperative need for continuing research on medical AI model's safety issues and for developing potential defensive solutions against adversarial attacks.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) is the next great advance informing medical science. Several disciplines, including vascular surgery, use AI-based decision-making tools to improve clinical performance. Although applied widely, AI functions best when confronted with voluminous, accurate data. Consistent, predictable analytic technique selection also challenges researchers. This article contextualizes AI analyses within evidence-based medicine, focusing on \"big data\" and health services research, as well as discussing opportunities to improve data collection and realize AI's promise.", "Computational chemistry and structure-based design have traditionally been viewed as a subset of tools that could aid acceleration of the drug discovery process, but were not commonly regarded as a driving force in small molecule drug discovery. In the last decade however, there have been dramatic advances in the field, including (1) development of physics-based computational approaches to accurately predict a broad variety of endpoints from potency to solubility, (2) improvements in artificial intelligence and deep learning methods and (3) dramatic increases in computational power with the advent of GPUs and cloud computing, resulting in the ability to explore and accurately profile vast amounts of drug-like chemical space in silico. There have also been simultaneous advancements in structural biology such as cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and computational protein-structure prediction, allowing for access to many more high-resolution 3D structures of novel drug-receptor complexes. The convergence of these breakthroughs has positioned structurally-enabled computational methods to be a driving force behind the discovery of novel small molecule therapeutics. This review will give a broad overview of the synergies in recent advances in the fields of computational chemistry, machine learning and structural biology, in particular in the areas of hit identification, hit-to-lead, and lead optimization.", "To develop a nomogram based on computed tomography (CT) texture analysis for the preoperative prediction of visceral pleural invasion in patients with cT1N0M0 lung adenocarcinoma.\nA dataset of chest CT containing lung nodules was collected from two institutions, and all surgically resected nodules were classified pathologically based on the presence of visceral pleural invasion. Each nodule on the CT image was segmented automatically by artificial-intelligence software and its CT texture features were extracted. The dataset was divided into training and external validation cohorts according to the institution, and a nomogram for predicting visceral pleural invasion was developed and validated.\nOf a total of 313 patients enrolled from two independent institutions, 63 were diagnosed with visceral pleural invasion. Three-dimensional (3D) CT long diameter, skewness, and sphericity, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were identified as independent predictors for visceral pleural invasion by multivariable logistic regression. The nomogram based on multivariable logistic regression showed great discriminative ability, as indicated by a C-index of 0.890 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.867-0.914) and 0.864 (95% CI: 0.817-0.911) for the training and external validation cohorts, respectively. Additionally, calibration of the nomogram revealed good predictive ability, as indicated by the Brier score (0.108 and 0.100 for the training and external validation cohorts, respectively).\nA nomogram was developed that could compute the probability of visceral pleural invasion in patients with cT1N0M0 lung adenocarcinoma with good calibration and discrimination. The nomogram has potential as a reliable tool for clinical evaluation and decision-making.", "Objective: To develop a prototype artificial intelligence image recognition system for detecting dental caries, especially those without cavities, in children. Methods: Seven hundred and twelve intraoral photos, which were taken by dental professionals using a digital camera from October 2013 to June 2020 in the Department of Pediatric Dentistry, Peking University School and Hospital of Stomatology, were collected from the children who received dental treatment under general anesthesia. The well-documented post-treatment electronic dental record of each child was identified as label standard to determine whether the teeth were carious and the type of caries types such as caries that had become cavities (caries with cavities), pit and fissure caries that had not become cavities (pit and fissure caries) and proximal caries which the marginal ridge enamel had not been destroyed (proximal caries). The various teeth and caries types were labeled by pediatric dentists using VoTT software (Windows 2.1.0, Microsoft, U S A). There were five labeled groups: pit and fissure caries, approximal caries, non-carious approximal surfaces, caries with cavities and teeth without caries (including intact fillings). Each group was randomly divided into training dataset, validation dataset and test dataset at a ratio of 6.4\u22361.6\u22362.0 by using random number table. After using the labeled training dataset for deep learning training, a deep learning-based artificial intelligence (AI) image recognition system for detecting dental caries was established, with the caries probability greater than 50.0% as the criterion for determining caries. Sensitivity and accuracy were used as indicators of recognition specificity. Results: Seven hundred and twelve single-jaw intraoral photographs were segmented and annotated into 953 pit and fissure caries, 1 002 approximal caries, 3 008 caries with cavities, 3 189 teeth without caries and 862 non-carious approximal surfaces, totaly 9 014 labels. The sensitivities and specificities of the test set were 96.0% and 97.0% for caries with cavities, 95.8% and 99.0% for pit and fissure caries and 88.1% and 97.1% for approximal caries. Conclusions: The current AI system developed based on deep learning of the intra-oral photos in the present study showed the ability to detect dental caries. Furthermore, the AI system could accurately verify different types of dental caries such as caries with cavities, pit and fissure caries and proximal caries.\n\u76ee\u7684\uff1a \u901a\u8fc7\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u5177\u5907\u5224\u65ad\u513f\u7ae5\u7259\u9f7f\u662f\u5426\u9f8b\u574f\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5224\u65ad\u672a\u6210\u6d1e\u9f8b\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u8bc6\u522b\u7cfb\u7edf\u96cf\u5f62\u3002 \u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a \u6536\u96c6\u5317\u4eac\u5927\u5b66\u53e3\u8154\u533b\u5b66\u9662\u00b7\u53e3\u8154\u533b\u9662\u513f\u7ae5\u53e3\u8154\u79d12013\u5e7410\u6708\u81f32020\u5e746\u6708\u62cd\u6444\u7684\u7b26\u5408\u7eb3\u5165\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u5168\u8eab\u9ebb\u9189\u6cbb\u7597\u524d\u60a3\u513f\u5355\u988c\u53e3\u5185\u6570\u7801\u7167\u7247712\u5f20\uff0c\u4ee5\u8bb0\u5f55\u5b8c\u5907\u7684\u6cbb\u7597\u540e\u75c5\u5386\u8bca\u65ad\u7ed3\u5408\u53e3\u5185\u50cf\u786e\u5b9a\u7259\u9f7f\u662f\u5426\u9f8b\u574f\u4ee5\u53ca\u9f8b\u7684\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u5177\u4f53\u5305\u62ec\uff1a\u5df2\u6210\u6d1e\u7684\u9f8b\uff08\u6210\u6d1e\u9f8b\uff09\u3001\u672a\u6210\u6d1e\u7684\u7a9d\u6c9f\u9f8b\u3001\u8fb9\u7f18\u5d74\u91c9\u8d28\u672a\u7834\u574f\u7684\u90bb\u9762\u9f8b\uff08\u672a\u6210\u6d1e\u90bb\u9762\u9f8b\uff09\u3002\u7531\u513f\u7ae5\u53e3\u8154\u79d1\u533b\u5e08\u4f7f\u7528VoTT\u8f6f\u4ef6\uff08Windows 2.1.0\uff0cMicrosoft\uff0c\u7f8e\u56fd\uff09\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u7259\u9f7f\u53ca\u9f8b\u574f\u7c7b\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u6807\u6ce8\u3002\u52065\u4e2a\u6807\u7b7e\u7ec4\uff1a\u672a\u6210\u6d1e\u7a9d\u6c9f\u9f8b\u3001\u672a\u6210\u6d1e\u90bb\u9762\u9f8b\u3001\u5b8c\u597d\u65e0\u9f8b\u574f\u7684\u7259\u9f7f\u90bb\u9762\u3001\u6210\u6d1e\u9f8b\u53ca\u65e0\u9f8b\u7259\uff08\u542b\u5df2\u5b8c\u597d\u5145\u586b\u7684\u7259\u9f7f\uff09\uff1b\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6807\u7b7e\u7ec4\u6570\u636e\u63096.4\u2236 1.6\u2236 2.0\u7684\u6bd4\u4f8b\u91c7\u7528\u968f\u673a\u6570\u8868\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u968f\u673a\u5206\u4e3a\u8bad\u7ec3\u96c6\u3001\u9a8c\u8bc1\u96c6\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u6570\u636e\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u6807\u6ce8\u540e\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u9f8b\u9f7f\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u8bc6\u522b\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4ee5\u9f8b\u574f\u6982\u7387\u5927\u4e8e50.0%\u4f5c\u4e3a\u60a3\u9f8b\u7684\u5224\u65ad\u6807\u51c6\u8f93\u51fa\u5224\u65ad\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc6\u522b\u3002\u5e94\u7528\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u3001\u7279\u5f02\u5ea6\u7b49\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bc6\u522b\u5404\u7c7b\u9f8b\u574f\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u6307\u6807\u8bc4\u4ef7\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5224\u65ad\u80fd\u529b\u3002 \u7ed3\u679c\uff1a 712\u5f20\u5355\u988c\u53e3\u5185\u7167\u7247\u7ecf\u5206\u5272\u6807\u6ce8\u5f97\u5230\u672a\u6210\u6d1e\u7a9d\u6c9f\u9f8b953\u5f20\uff0c\u672a\u6210\u6d1e\u90bb\u9762\u9f8b1 002\u5f20\uff0c\u6210\u6d1e\u9f8b3 008\u5f20\uff0c\u65e0\u9f8b\u72593 189\u5f20\uff0c\u65e0\u9f8b\u90bb\u9762862\u5f20\uff0c\u5171\u8ba19 014\u5f20\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u3002\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u7684\u8bc6\u522b\u7ed3\u679c\uff1a\u5bf9\u6210\u6d1e\u9f8b\u8bc6\u522b\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u548c\u7279\u5f02\u5ea6\u5206\u522b\u4e3a96.0%\u548c97.0%\uff1b\u5bf9\u672a\u6210\u6d1e\u7a9d\u6c9f\u9f8b\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u4e3a95.8%\uff0c\u7279\u5f02\u5ea699.0%\uff1b\u5bf9\u672a\u6210\u6d1e\u90bb\u9762\u9f8b\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u4e3a88.1%\uff0c\u7279\u5f02\u5ea697.1%\u3002 \u7ed3\u8bba\uff1a \u672c\u7814\u7a76\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u513f\u7ae5\u9f8b\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u8bc6\u522b\u7cfb\u7edf\u96cf\u5f62\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u5224\u65ad\u9f8b\u574f\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5bf9\u540c\u7ec4\u6837\u672c\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0d\u4ec5\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u5224\u65ad\u6210\u6d1e\u9f8b\uff0c\u5bf9\u672a\u6210\u6d1e\u7684\u7a9d\u6c9f\u9f8b\u3001\u8fb9\u7f18\u5d74\u91c9\u8d28\u672a\u7834\u574f\u7684\u90bb\u9762\u9f8b\u4e5f\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u5224\u65ad\u3002.", "The research achievements of artificial intelligence technology in the development of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were explored, and the advantages and problems encountered in the development of intelligent nursing were analyzed. This paper presents the application of artificial intelligence in the emergency care of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The method included 447 COPD patients in a randomized controlled trial to observe the improvement of quality of life at 4 and 12 months after artificial intelligence medical intervention. A prospective randomized controlled trial included 101 patients with COPD who underwent a 9-month web-based knowledge exercise on the prevention of acute exacerbation of COPD through artificial intelligence medicine and were randomly divided into two groups: the experimental group and the control group. The results show that, in the experimental group and the control group, after 4 months, the quality of life does not change; after 12 months, compared with controls, the quality of life and emotional and psychological conditions have improved obviously. 29 patients who participated in the experiment and were randomly divided into the experimental group and the control group showed satisfactory results. COPD hospitalized rate and length of hospital stay were decreased in the experimental group than in the control group. For single-factor analysis, artificial intelligence medical intervention has not achieved significant significance, and the experimental results have preliminarily confirmed the effectiveness of artificial intelligence medical treatment.", "It is suggested that Jumping To Conclusions (JTC) reasoning bias might contribute to the distortion of external reality. However, the association between psychotic manifestations and JTC is obscure, especially if general intelligence is considered as a mediator. The aim of this study is to investigate the relation between severity, early clinical improvement and remission of symptoms in First Episode Psychosis (FEP) with JTC as an explanatory factor. One hundred seventy-one FEP individuals were evaluated with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) at baseline and one month after treatment initiation. Clinical improvement was ascribed as symptom change one-month post-baseline measurements. Symptomatic remission was assessed with the Andreasen severity criteria and JTC with the Beads Task, operationalized through Draws To Decision (DTD) (the lower the number of DTD, the higher the JTC bias). Regarding symptoms severity, total psychotic, total positive psychotic, and hallucinations-item PANSS scores showed a negative association with JTC after controlling for IQ. Regarding early clinical improvement, the association with JTC was non-significant. No significant association was detected between one month remission status of FEP and JTC. Our findings indicate that severity of positive symptoms is not associated with hastiness in decision-making, but rather with a heightened conservatism in terms of increased data gathering. Further research is required to replicate the results and clarify the cognitive processes involved.", "Advances in computer technology and growing expectations from computer-aided systems have led to the evolution of artificial intelligence into subsets, such as deep learning and radiomics, and the use of these systems is revolutionizing modern radiological diagnosis. In this review, artificial intelligence applications developed with radiomics and deep learning methods in the differential diagnosis of parotid gland tumors (PGTs) will be overviewed.\nThe development of artificial intelligence models has opened new scenarios owing to the possibility of assessing features of medical images that usually are not evaluated by physicians. Radiomics and deep learning models come to the forefront in computer-aided diagnosis of medical images, even though their applications in the differential diagnosis of PGTs have been limited because of the scarcity of data sets related to these rare neoplasms. Nevertheless, recent studies have shown that artificial intelligence tools can classify common PGTs with reasonable accuracy.\nAll studies aimed at the differential diagnosis of benign vs. malignant PGTs or the identification of the commonest PGT subtypes were identified, and five studies were found that focused on deep learning-based differential diagnosis of PGTs. Data sets were created in three of these studies with MRI and in two with computed tomography (CT). Additional seven studies were related to radiomics. Of these, four were on MRI-based radiomics, two on CT-based radiomics, and one compared MRI and CT-based radiomics in the same patients.", "Autonomous experimentation enabled by artificial intelligence offers a new paradigm for accelerating scientific discovery. Nonequilibrium materials synthesis is emblematic of complex, resource-intensive experimentation whose acceleration would be a watershed for materials discovery. We demonstrate accelerated exploration of metastable materials through hierarchical autonomous experimentation governed by the Scientific Autonomous Reasoning Agent (SARA). SARA integrates robotic materials synthesis using lateral gradient laser spike annealing and optical characterization along with a hierarchy of AI methods to map out processing phase diagrams. Efficient exploration of the multidimensional parameter space is achieved with nested active learning cycles built upon advanced machine learning models that incorporate the underlying physics of the experiments and end-to-end uncertainty quantification. We demonstrate SARA\u2019s performance by autonomously mapping synthesis phase boundaries for the Bi2O3 system, leading to orders-of-magnitude acceleration in the establishment of a synthesis phase diagram that includes conditions for stabilizing \u03b4-Bi2O3 at room temperature, a critical development for electrochemical technologies.", "To determine whether artificial intelligence (AI) can generate plausible and engaging titles for potential Christmas research articles in The BMJ.\nObservational study.\nEurope, Australia, and Africa.\n1 AI technology (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3, GPT-3) and 25 humans.\nPlausibility, attractiveness, enjoyability, and educational value of titles for potential Christmas research articles in The BMJ generated by GPT-3 compared with historical controls.\nAI generated titles were rated at least as enjoyable (159/250 responses (64%) v 346/500 responses (69%); odds ratio 0.9, 95% confidence interval 0.7 to 1.2) and attractive (176/250 (70%) v 342/500 (68%); 1.1, 0.8 to 1.4) as real control titles, although the real titles were rated as more plausible (182/250 (73%) v 238/500 (48%); 3.1, 2.3 to 4.1). The AI generated titles overall were rated as having less scientific or educational merit than the real controls (146/250 (58%) v 193/500 (39%); 2.0, 1.5 to 2.6); this difference, however, became non-significant when humans curated the AI output (146/250 (58%) v 123/250 (49%); 1.3, 1.0 to 1.8). Of the AI generated titles, the most plausible was \"The association between belief in conspiracy theories and the willingness to receive vaccinations,\" and the highest rated was \"The effects of free gourmet coffee on emergency department waiting times: an observational study.\"\nAI can generate plausible, entertaining, and scientifically interesting titles for potential Christmas research articles in The BMJ; as in other areas of medicine, performance was enhanced by human intervention.", "As new paradigms for cardiothoracic surgery training emerged in recent years, the traditional 2- or 3-year pathway has persisted as an option for trainees completing general surgery residencies. Although the applicant pool for 6-year integrated cardiothoracic surgery training programs has been superficially explored, little data exist characterizing those applicants to the traditional cardiothoracic surgery training pathway and the influence of 6-year integrated expansion on the traditional applicant pool.\nWe reviewed materials from candidates applying to a single 2-year cardiothoracic surgery training program between 2015 and 2020. Descriptive and comparative analyses of multiple characteristics were performed over the years of the study.\nDuring the years 2015 through 2020, we received 571 applications, accounting for 72% of the total National Residency Matching Program applicant pool. We saw no significant trends in numbers of peer-reviewed publications or presentations. There was a minimal year-to-year increase in number of first-authored posters, 2.04 in 2015 to 2.13 in 2020 (P\u00a0=\u00a0.008). Online publications, book chapters, and other publications were stable throughout the study period. Applicants consistently provided an average of 3.6 letters of recommendation, 1.9 from cardiothoracic surgery faculty. Mean in-service score percentiles were stable at the 54th percentile, whereas US Medical Licensing Examination scores increased.\nDespite expansion of the 6-year integrated pathway to cardiothoracic surgery, we have seen no substantial year-to-year changes in attributes of traditional applicants. Our findings suggest that the cardiothoracic surgery applicant pool continues to be composed of a stable group of highly productive trainees. Future initiatives in candidate selection should emphasize interview strategies to highlight aspects of grit, emotional intelligence, and team dynamics.", "To conduct a systematic survey of published techniques for automated diagnosis and prognosis of COVID-19 diseases using medical imaging, assessing the validity of reported performance and investigating the proposed clinical use-case. To conduct a scoping review into the authors publishing such work.\nThe Scopus database was queried and studies were screened for article type, and minimum source normalized impact per paper and citations, before manual relevance assessment and a bias assessment derived from a subset of the Checklist for Artificial Intelligence in Medical Imaging (CLAIM). The number of failures of the full CLAIM was adopted as a surrogate for risk-of-bias. Methodological and performance measurements were collected from each technique. Each study was assessed by one author. Comparisons were evaluated for significance with a two-sided independent t-test.\nOf 1002 studies identified, 390 remained after screening and 81 after relevance and bias exclusion. The ratio of exclusion for bias was 71%, indicative of a high level of bias in the field. The mean number of CLAIM failures per study was 8.3\u2009\u00b1\u20093.9 [1,17] (mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation [min,max]). 58% of methods performed diagnosis versus 31% prognosis. Of the diagnostic methods, 38% differentiated COVID-19 from healthy controls. For diagnostic techniques, area under the receiver operating curve (AUC)\u2009=\u20090.924\u2009\u00b1\u20090.074 [0.810,0.991] and accuracy\u2009=\u200991.7%\u2009\u00b1\u20096.4 [79.0,99.0]. For prognostic techniques, AUC\u2009=\u20090.836\u2009\u00b1\u20090.126 [0.605,0.980] and accuracy\u2009=\u200978.4%\u2009\u00b1\u20099.4 [62.5,98.0]. CLAIM failures did not correlate with performance, providing confidence that the highest results were not driven by biased papers. Deep learning techniques reported higher AUC (p\u2009<\u20090.05) and accuracy (p\u2009<\u20090.05), but no difference in CLAIM failures was identified.\nA majority of papers focus on the less clinically impactful diagnosis task, contrasted with prognosis, with a significant portion performing a clinically unnecessary task of differentiating COVID-19 from healthy. Authors should consider the clinical scenario in which their work would be deployed when developing techniques. Nevertheless, studies report superb performance in a potentially impactful application. Future work is warranted in translating techniques into clinical tools.", "One important aspect of protein function is the binding of proteins to ligands, including small molecules, metal ions, and macromolecules such as DNA or RNA. Despite decades of experimental progress many binding sites remain obscure. Here, we proposed bindEmbed21, a method predicting whether a protein residue binds to metal ions, nucleic acids, or small molecules. The Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based method exclusively uses embeddings from the Transformer-based protein Language Model (pLM) ProtT5 as input. Using only single sequences without creating multiple sequence alignments (MSAs), bindEmbed21DL outperformed MSA-based predictions. Combination with homology-based inference increased performance to F1\u2009=\u200948\u2009\u00b1\u20093% (95% CI) and MCC\u2009=\u20090.46\u2009\u00b1\u20090.04 when merging all three ligand classes into one. All results were confirmed by three independent data sets. Focusing on very reliably predicted residues could complement experimental evidence: For the 25% most strongly predicted binding residues, at least 73% were correctly predicted even when ignoring the problem of missing experimental annotations. The new method bindEmbed21 is fast, simple, and broadly applicable-neither using structure nor MSAs. Thereby, it found binding residues in over 42% of all human proteins not otherwise implied in binding and predicted about 6% of all residues as binding to metal ions, nucleic acids, or small molecules.", "Knowledge in the fields of biochemistry, structural biology, immunological principles, microbiology, and genomics has all increased dramatically in recent years. There has also been tremendous growth in the fields of data science, informatics, and artificial intelligence needed to handle this immense data flow. At the intersection of wet lab and data science is the field of bioinformatics, which seeks to apply computational tools to better understanding of the biological sciences. Like so many other areas of biology, bioinformatics has transformed immunology research leading to the discipline of immunoinformatics. Within this field, many new databases and computational tools have been created that increasingly drive immunology research, in many cases drawing upon artificial intelligence and machine learning to predict complex immune system behaviors, for example, prediction of B cell and T cell epitopes. In this book chapter, we provide an overview of computational tools and artificial intelligence being used for protein modeling, drug screening, vaccine design, and highlight how these tools are being used to transform approaches to pandemic countermeasure development, by reference to the current COVID-19 pandemic.", "Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a microvascular complication of diabetes mellitus and a major cause of vision loss worldwide. The purpose of this review is to provide an update on the prevalence of diabetic retinopathy in youth, discuss risk factors, and review recent advances in diabetic retinopathy screening.\nWhile DR has long been considered a microvascular complication, recent data suggests that retinal neurodegeneration may precede the vascular changes associated with DR. The prevalence of DR has decreased in type 1 diabetes (T1D) patients following the results of the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial and implementation of intensive insulin therapy, with prevalence ranging from 14-20% before the year 2000 to 3.7-6% after 2000. In contrast, the prevalence of diabetic retinopathy in pediatric type 2 diabetes (T2D) is higher, ranging from 9.1-50%. Risk factors for diabetic retinopathy are well established and include glycemic control, diabetes duration, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia, whereas diabetes technology use including insulin pumps and continuous glucose monitors has been shown to have protective effects. Screening for DR is recommended for youth with T1D once they are aged\u2009\u2265\u200911\u00a0years or puberty has started and diabetes duration of 3-5\u00a0years. Pediatric T2D patients are advised to undergo screening at or soon after diagnosis, and annually thereafter, due to the insidious nature of T2D. Recent advances in DR screening methods including point of care and artificial intelligence technology have increased access to DR screening, while being cost-saving to patients and cost-effective to healthcare systems. While the prevalence of diabetic retinopathy in youth with T1D has been declining over the last few decades, there has been a significant increase in the prevalence of DR in youth with T2D. Improving access to diabetic retinopathy screening using novel screening methods may help improve detection and early treatment of diabetic retinopathy.", "For the association between time-lapse technology (TLT) and embryo ploidy status, there has not yet been fully understood. TLT has the characteristics of large amount of data and non-invasiveness. If we want to accurately predict embryo ploidy status from TLT, artificial intelligence (AI) technology is a good choice. However, the current work of AI in this field needs to be strengthened.\nA total of 469 preimplantation genetic testing (PGT) cycles and 1803 blastocysts from April 2018 to November 2019 were included in the study. All embryo images are captured during 5 or 6 days after fertilization before biopsy by time-lapse microscope system. All euploid embryos or aneuploid embryos are used as data sets. The data set is divided into training set, validation set and test set. The training set is mainly used for model training, the validation set is mainly used to adjust the hyperparameters of the model and the preliminary evaluation of the model, and the test set is used to evaluate the generalization ability of the model. For better verification, we used data other than the training data for external verification. A total of 155 PGT cycles from December 2019 to December 2020 and 523 blastocysts were included in the verification process.\nThe euploid prediction algorithm (EPA) was able to predict euploid on the testing dataset with an area under curve (AUC) of 0.80.\nThe TLT incubator has gradually become the choice of reproductive centers. Our AI model named EPA that can predict embryo ploidy well based on TLT data. We hope that this system can serve all in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer (IVF-ET) patients in the future, allowing embryologists to have more non-invasive aids when selecting the best embryo to transfer.", "Extensive sampling of neural activity during rich cognitive phenomena is critical for robust understanding of brain function. Here we present the Natural Scenes Dataset (NSD), in which high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging responses to tens of thousands of richly annotated natural scenes were measured while participants performed a continuous recognition task. To optimize data quality, we developed and applied novel estimation and denoising techniques. Simple visual inspections of the NSD data reveal clear representational transformations along the ventral visual pathway. Further exemplifying the inferential power of the dataset, we used NSD to build and train deep neural network models that predict brain activity more accurately than state-of-the-art models from computer vision. NSD also includes substantial resting-state and diffusion data, enabling network neuroscience perspectives to constrain and enhance models of perception and memory. Given its unprecedented scale, quality and breadth, NSD opens new avenues of inquiry in cognitive neuroscience and artificial intelligence.", "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new type of respiratory disease that has been announced as a pandemic. The COVID-19 outbreak has changed the way we live. It has also changed the food service industry. This study aimed to identify trends in the food and food service industry after the COVID-19 outbreak and suggest research themes induced by industry trends. This study investigated the industry and academic information on the food and food service industry and societal trends resulting from the COVID-19 outbreak. The most noticeable changes in the food industry include the explosive increase in home meal replacement, meal-kit consumption, online orders, take-out, and drive-through. The adoption of technologies, including robots and artificial intelligence, has also been noted. Such industry trends are discussed in this paper from a research perspective, including consumer, employee, and organizational strategy perspectives. This study reviews the changes in the food service industry after COVID-19 and the implications that these changes have rendered to academia. The paper concludes with future expectations that would come in the era of COVID-19.", "The human vision system can extract a stable representation of the always-changing visual world. However, the mechanism underlying such perceptual continuity remains unclear. A possible candidate is the serial dependence: visual perception of an object is positively biased toward the visual input from the recent past. Does the visual system use one pattern of serial dependence for general purposes? Or different patterns of serial dependence for different visual tasks? Because different social facial traits (e.g., trustworthiness and dominance) are dissociable, it is reasonable to assume that the perception of different facial characteristics would require different patterns of serial dependences. In this study, we examine the existence and the similarities of the serial dependence(s) in the evaluation of seven facial characteristics (i.e., attractiveness, trustworthiness, confidence, dominance, intelligence, age, and aggressiveness). The convergent evidence from conventional Derivative of Gaussian fitting and Markov Chain modeling demonstrated that (1) serial dependence exists in judgments of all seven social facial characteristic, (2) the serial dependences of them are highly similar, and (3) the serial dependence follows the efficient coding. Thus it is highly possible that there exists a general serial dependence mechanism for (at least high-level) vision processing. Moreover, we used the Markov Chain modeling to better describe the transitional pattern of serial dependence, which is a kind of Markov process. These findings may shed light on future works regarding serial dependence, as well as face perception.", "There is a consistent body of evidence on the association between single nutrients and cognition, but the role of a healthful dietary pattern on cognition in children has been seldomly studied. This study aims to assess the association between dietary patterns at 4 years (y) and cognitive abilities at 10-13y and examine whether adiposity mediated these associations.\nThis study used data from a sub-sample of the population-based birth cohort Generation XXI, with complete information on diet and cognition (n\u00a0=\u00a03575). At 4y, data on dietary intake was collected by a validated food frequency questionnaire and dietary patterns were derived by latent class analysis, namely Energy-dense food (EDF) pattern, Snacking pattern and Healthier pattern (Reference). At 10-13y, the Portuguese Version of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children\u00ae-Third Edition was administered by trained psychologists and age-adjusted composite scores were computed: a Full-Scale Intelligence Quotient (IQ), plus a Verbal IQ, Performance IQ and Processing Speed IQ. Age- and sex-specific body mass index (BMI) z-scores, body fat percentage from bioimpedance, and waist-to-weight ratio and waist-to-hip ratio were used as measures of adiposity. Regression coefficients and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were computed using linear regression models (adjusted for maternal age and education, pre-pregnancy BMI, smoking and alcohol intake during pregnancy, child's sex, birthweight, exclusive breastfeeding duration and having siblings at 4y). Mediation analysis was conducted using path analysis.\nAfter adjustment, children classified in the EDF or a Snacking patterns at 4y were more likely to have lower scores on total IQ (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-0.116; 95%CI:-0.192,-0.039 and \u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-0.148; 95%CI\u00a0-0.252,-0.044, respectively), Verbal IQ (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-0.104; 95%CI\u00a0-0.177,\u00a0-0.031 and \u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-0.163; 95%CI\u00a0-0.262,-0.064, respectively) and Performance IQ (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-0.116 95%CI\u00a0-0.193,-0.040 and \u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-0.147; 95%CI\u00a0-0.250,-0.042, respectively) at 10-13y, when compared to those classified in the Healthier pattern. None of the adiposity measures seemed to explain the associations between dietary patterns and IQ.\nThis study supports that early unhealthy dietary patterns were associated with lower child's cognitive ability, but this effect did not seem to be mediated by adiposity.", "With gun crime on the rise, efforts to curb this form of violence have captured the attention of government agencies and police departments alike. One form of such efforts is the proliferation of Crime Gun Intelligence Centers (CGICs) in police departments across the country. However, with only three non-peer-reviewed evaluations of these CGICs to date, our understanding of their effectiveness is limited. The present study aims to fill this gap by examining the impact of the Phoenix Police Department's (PPD) CGIC on clearance rates and prosecutorial outcomes for gun crimes. The data for this study come from PPD's Records Management System (RMS), computer-aided dispatch (CAD) system, impounded evidence, National Integrated Ballistics Information Network (NIBIN) lead data, and arrest data. Prosecutorial data were supplied by the Maricopa County Attorney's Office (MCAO). This study examined pretest and posttest differences that occurred over the study period. Difference-in-difference (DID) models were calculated to assess the impact of the CGIC on the outcome measures of interest. We found that from the year prior to the CGIC to 2\u00a0years post-CGIC, NIBIN inputs increased by 115%, NIBIN leads increased by 163%, timeliness of entry (of ballistics evidence) improved with 32% of processed items entered within 24-48\u00a0h in the second year of the CGIC compared with only 3% the year preceding the CGIC, and clearance rates for arrests increased significantly. These findings have implications for the continued adoption of CGIC, as well as the utility of NIBIN.", "Plants have evolved different mechanisms to disperse from parent plants and improve germination to sustain their survival. The study of seed dispersal mechanisms, with the related structural and functional characteristics, is an active research topic for ecology, plant diversity, climate change, as well as for its relevance for material science and engineering. The natural mechanisms of seed dispersal show a rich source of robust, highly adaptive, mass and energy efficient mechanisms for optimized passive flying, landing, crawling and drilling. The secret of seeds mobility is embodied in the structural features and anatomical characteristics of their tissues, which are designed to be selectively responsive to changes in the environmental conditions, and which make seeds one of the most fascinating examples of morphological computation in Nature. Particularly clever for their spatial mobility performance, are those seeds that use their morphology and structural characteristics to be carried by the wind and dispersed over great distances (i.e. \"winged\" and \"parachute\" seeds), and seeds able to move and penetrate in soil with a self-burial mechanism driven by their hygromorphic properties and morphological features. By looking at their motion mechanisms, new design principles can be extracted and used as inspiration for smart artificial systems endowed with embodied intelligence. This mini-review systematically collects, for the first time together, the morphological, structural, biomechanical and aerodynamic information from selected plant seeds relevant to take inspiration for engineering design of soft robots, and discusses potential future developments in the field across material science, plant biology, robotics and embodied intelligence.", "Basic foundations of artificial intelligence (AI) include analyzing large amounts of data, recognizing patterns, and predicting outcomes. At the core of AI are well-defined areas, such as machine learning, natural language processing, artificial neural networks, and computer vision. Although research and development of AI in health care is being conducted in many medical subspecialties, only a few applications have been implemented in clinical practice. This is true in vascular surgery, where applications are mostly in the translational research stage. These AI applications are being evaluated in the realms of vascular diagnostics, perioperative medicine, risk stratification, and outcome prediction, among others. Apart from the technical challenges of AI and research outcomes on safe and beneficial use in patient care, ethical issues and policy surrounding AI will present future challenges for its successful implementation. This review will give a brief overview and a basic understanding of AI and summarize the currently available and used clinical AI applications in vascular surgery.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to identify treatable phenotypes, optimise ventilation strategies, and provide clinical decision support for patients who require mechanical ventilation. Gallifant and colleagues performed a systematic review to identify studies using AI to solve a diverse range of clinical problems in the ventilated patient. They identify 95 studies, the majority of which were reported in the last 5 yr. Their findings indicate that the majority of studies have significant methodological bias and are a long way from deployment.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies have been applied in various medical domains to predict patient outcomes with high accuracy. As AI becomes more widely adopted, the problem of model bias is increasingly apparent. In this study, we investigate the model bias that can occur when training a model using datasets for only one particular gender and aim to present new insights into the bias issue. For the investigation, we considered an AI model that predicts severity at an early stage based on the medical records of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) patients. For 5,601 confirmed COVID-19 patients, we used 37 medical records, namely, basic patient information, physical index, initial examination findings, clinical findings, comorbidity diseases, and general blood test results at an early stage. To investigate the gender-based AI model bias, we trained and evaluated two separate models-one that was trained using only the male group, and the other using only the female group. When the model trained by the male-group data was applied to the female testing data, the overall accuracy decreased-sensitivity from 0.93 to 0.86, specificity from 0.92 to 0.86, accuracy from 0.92 to 0.86, balanced accuracy from 0.93 to 0.86, and area under the curve (AUC) from 0.97 to 0.94. Similarly, when the model trained by the female-group data was applied to the male testing data, once again, the overall accuracy decreased-sensitivity from 0.97 to 0.90, specificity from 0.96 to 0.91, accuracy from 0.96 to 0.91, balanced accuracy from 0.96 to 0.90, and AUC from 0.97 to 0.95. Furthermore, when we evaluated each gender-dependent model with the test data from the same gender used for training, the resultant accuracy was also lower than that from the unbiased model.", "Suicide is the 10th leading cause of death in the United States, with >47,000 deaths in 2019. Most people who died by suicide had contact with the health care system in the year before their death. Health care provider training is a top research priority identified by the National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention; however, evidence-based approaches that target skill-building are resource intensive and difficult to implement. Advances in artificial intelligence technology hold promise for improving the scalability and sustainability of training methods, as it is now possible for computers to assess the intervention delivery skills of trainees and provide feedback to guide skill improvements. Much remains to be known about how best to integrate these novel technologies into continuing education for health care providers.\nIn Project WISE (Workplace Integrated Support and Education), we aim to develop e-learning training in suicide safety planning, enhanced with novel skill-building technologies that can be integrated into the routine workflow of nurses serving patients hospitalized for medical or surgical reasons or traumatic injury. The research aims include identifying strategies for the implementation and workflow integration of both the training and safety planning with patients, adapting 2 existing technologies to enhance general counseling skills for use in suicide safety planning (a conversational agent and an artificial intelligence-based feedback system), observing training acceptability and nurse engagement with the training components, and assessing the feasibility of recruitment, retention, and collection of longitudinal self-report and electronic health record data for patients identified as at risk of suicide.\nOur developmental research includes qualitative and observational methods to explore the implementation context and technology usability, formative evaluation of the training paradigm, and pilot research to assess the feasibility of conducting a future cluster randomized pragmatic trial. The trial will examine whether patients hospitalized for medical or surgical reasons or traumatic injury who are at risk of suicide have better suicide-related postdischarge outcomes when admitted to a unit with nurses trained using the skill-building technology than those admitted to a unit with untrained nurses. The research takes place at a level 1 trauma center, which is also a safety-net hospital and academic medical center.\nProject WISE was funded in July 2019. As of September 2021, we have completed focus groups and usability testing with 27 acute care and 3 acute and intensive care nurses. We began data collection for research aims 3 and 4 in November 2021. All research has been approved by the University of Washington institutional review board.\nProject WISE aims to further the national agenda to improve suicide prevention in health care settings by training nurses in suicide prevention with medically hospitalized patients using novel e-learning technologies.\nDERR1-10.2196/33695.", "Informal caregivers are key players in maintaining chronically ill patients at home but often experience negative consequences such as informal caregiver burnout. The processes by which determinants related to informal care and their personal and social resources affect the caregiver's risk of burnout remains little investigated. Recent theoretical works have suggested that two mediators could play an important role in understanding how these risks and resources influence informal caregiver burnout: by deteriorating how they view their role (caregiving appraisal) and by weakening the relationship with the care-recipient (relationship quality). The present study aimed at exploring the impact of the care-recipient's dependency (WHODAS), the caregiver's emotional intelligence (TEIQue-SF), and loneliness (UCLALS) on informal caregiver burnout (MBI-ICg). This association was explored both directly and through the mediation of caregiving appraisal (measured by subjective burden, ZBI) and relationship quality. To do so, a sample of 444 French-speaking informal caregivers completed online questionnaires from November 2017 to August 2018. Structural equation modelling (SEM) was performed to test the mediation model. As a result, the caregiving appraisal appears as a key mediator between determinants and informal caregiver burnout, whereas the relationship quality had a lower predictive value. Among the determinants, emotional intelligence was the strongest protective factor and the care-recipient's dependency was the strongest risk factor. But beyond this association, the perception informal caregivers have of their role (their caregiving appraisal) is a key mediator between these determinants and informal caregiver burnout, which emphasizes the importance of subjectivity in building risk and protective profiles.", "Within the methodologically diverse interdisciplinary research on the minimal self, we identify two movements with seemingly disparate research agendas - cognitive science and cognitive (developmental) robotics. Cognitive science, on the one hand, devises rather abstract models which can predict and explain human experimental data related to the minimal self. Incorporating the established models of cognitive science and ideas from artificial intelligence, cognitive robotics, on the other hand, aims to build embodied learning machines capable of developing a self \"from scratch\" similar to human infants. The epistemic promise of the latter approach is that, at some point, robotic models can serve as a testbed for directly investigating the mechanisms that lead to the emergence of the minimal self. While both approaches can be productive for creating causal mechanistic models of the minimal self, we argue that building a minimal self is different from understanding the human minimal self. Thus, one should be cautious when drawing conclusions about the human minimal self based on robotic model implementations and vice versa. We further point out that incorporating constraints arising from different levels of analysis will be crucial for creating models that can predict, generate, and causally explain behavior in the real world.", "The Covid-19 pandemic has significantly impacted dental practices with the initial response being a complete suspension of face to face care unless designated as an urgent care centre. Even with subsequent easing of restrictions, a significant change to the delivery of dental care is continuing to restrict patient access. The introduction of new Standard Operating Procedures, with a benchmark fallow time of 15 to 30 minutes after aerosol generating procedures, has also reduced capacity levels within dental practices. Triaging systems have been implemented within practices to ensure those with the highest oral health care needs are prioritised for face to face care. Altered patient attendance, due to the Covid-19 restrictions placed upon dental care, may also be compounded by patients avoiding dental care due to personal perceptions of risks associated with Covid-19 or due to a desire not to overburden health systems. With the additional Covid-19 restrictions in place the access to dental care for vulnerable populations may have been even further impacted, there is therefore a concern that the restrictions may have exacerbated inequalities in oral health for these groups. Public health competencies illustrated: Developing and monitoring the quality of dental services, Dental Public Health Intelligence, and Policy and Strategy Development are illustrated within this project.", "In large-scale events such as concerts and sports competitions, participants often leave the venue at the same time to return to their respective destinations. Improper traffic planning and traffic light operation usually lead to traffic congestion and road chaos near the sites. Rapid evacuation of participants has become an important issue.\nIn this work, a one-way road orientation planning problem with multiple venues is studied in which all roads near the venues are to be scheduled into a one-way orientation with strong connectivity to increase the evacuation efficiency of participants.\nIn accordance with Robbins' theorem and a random sequence of integers, an encoding scheme based on module operator is presented to construct a strongly connected graph and plan a one-way orientation for all roads. The proposed encoding scheme is further embedded into four artificial intelligence approaches, namely, grey wolf optimization, immune algorithm, genetic algorithm, and particle swarm optimization, to solve the one-way road orientation planning problem such that the total distance of all vehicles from venues to their destinations is minimized.\nNumerical results of test problems with multiple venues in Taiwan are provided and analyzed. As shown, all four algorithms can obtain the best solution for the test problems.\nThe new presented encoding scheme with four algorithms can be used to effectively solve the one-way road orientation planning problem for the evacuation of participants. Moreover, grey wolf optimization is superior to the other three algorithms and particle swarm optimization is faster than the other three algorithms.", "To study the effect of levothyroxine sodium tablets on the growth and development and thyroid function in preterm infants with thyroid dysfunction.\nA retrospective analysis was performed for 82 preterm infants who were born in the Department of Obstetrics of the First People's Hospital of Yunnan Province, from January 1, 2013 to December 31, 2017, and these infants were hospitalized after birth in the Department of Neonatology of the hospital. They were regularly followed up to observe growth and development and thyroid function at the outpatient service of the Department of Neonatology. According to thyroid function test results, they were divided into an abnormal thyroid function group (observation group; n=31) and a normal thyroid function group (control group; n=51). The infants in the observation group were given oral administration of levothyroxine sodium tablets, while those in the control group were not given any treatment. The two groups were compared in terms of the physical and intelligence development and thyroid function of preterm infants with various gestational ages (28-<32 weeks, 32-<34 weeks, and 34-<37 weeks) after regular follow-up to the corrected age of 12 months.\nThere were no significant differences in physical development indices (body length, body weight, and head circumference) between the observation and control groups at various gestational ages after follow-up to the corrected age of 12 months (P>0.05). There were no significant differences between the two groups in the scores of each functional area of the Gesell Developmental Scale among the preterm infants with a gestational age of 28-<32 weeks and 32-<34 weeks after follow-up to the corrected age of 12 months (P>0.05). For the preterm infants with a gestational age of 34-<37 weeks, compared with the control group, the observation group had a significantly lower score of gross motor ability at the age of 3 and 12 months, significantly lower scores of fine motor ability, language ability, and adaptation ability at the age of 12 months (P<0.05), and a significantly lower score of personal-social ability at the age of 3 months (P<0.05). However, the score of personal-social ability in the observation group was not significantly different from the control group at the age of 12 months (P>0.05). After 2-4 weeks of treatment with levothyroxine sodium tablets, the thyroid function of the 31 preterm infants with thyroid dysfunction returned to normal. Among the 31 infants, 21 (68%) achieved complete drug withdrawal, with normal results of neonatal screening (100%); 10 infants (32%) failed to achieve drug withdrawal, and only 2 (20%) out of the 10 infants had normal neonatal screening results (P<0.05).\nEarly diagnosis and reasonable treatment can reduce the impact on growth and development in preterm infants with thyroid dysfunction. Most preterm infants tend to have transient thyroid dysfunction, while those with positive results of neonatal screening are more likely to develop permanent thyroid dysfunction.\n\u76ee\u7684: \u63a2\u8ba8\u7532\u72b6\u817a\u529f\u80fd\u5f02\u5e38\u65e9\u4ea7\u513f\u7ed9\u4e88\u5de6\u65cb\u7532\u72b6\u817a\u7d20\u94a0\u7247\u6cbb\u7597\u540e\u5bf9\u751f\u957f\u53d1\u80b2\u53ca\u7532\u72b6\u817a\u529f\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u65b9\u6cd5: \u9009\u53d62013\u5e741\u67081\u65e5\u81f32017\u5e7412\u670831\u65e5\u5728\u4e91\u5357\u7701\u7b2c\u4e00\u4eba\u6c11\u533b\u9662\u4ea7\u79d1\u51fa\u751f\u540e\u4e8e\u8be5\u9662\u65b0\u751f\u513f\u79d1\u4f4f\u9662\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u8be5\u9662\u65b0\u751f\u513f\u968f\u8bbf\u95e8\u8bca\u5b9a\u671f\u968f\u8bbf\u751f\u957f\u53d1\u80b2\u53ca\u7532\u72b6\u817a\u529f\u80fd\u60c5\u51b5\u7684\u65e9\u4ea7\u513f82\u4f8b\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u8c61\u884c\u56de\u987e\u6027\u5206\u6790\u3002\u6839\u636e\u7532\u72b6\u817a\u529f\u80fd\u68c0\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\u5206\u4e3a\u7532\u72b6\u817a\u529f\u80fd\u5f02\u5e38\u7ec4\uff08\u89c2\u5bdf\u7ec4\uff0cn=31\uff09\u548c\u7532\u72b6\u817a\u529f\u80fd\u6b63\u5e38\u7ec4\uff08\u5bf9\u7167\u7ec4\uff0cn=51\uff09\u3002\u89c2\u5bdf\u7ec4\u7ed9\u4e88\u53e3\u670d\u5de6\u65cb\u7532\u72b6\u817a\u7d20\u94a0\u7247\uff0c\u5bf9\u7167\u7ec4\u672a\u4e88\u5e72\u9884\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u80ce\u9f84\uff0828\u5468\u2264\u80ce\u9f84<32\u5468\u300132\u5468\u2264\u80ce\u9f84<34\u5468\u300134\u5468\u2264\u80ce\u9f84<37\u5468\uff09\u4e24\u7ec4\u65e9\u4ea7\u513f\u5b9a\u671f\u968f\u8bbf\u81f3\u77eb\u6b63\u5e74\u9f8412\u6708\u9f84\u65f6\u7684\u4f53\u683c\u3001\u667a\u529b\u53d1\u80b2\u60c5\u51b5\u53ca\u7532\u72b6\u817a\u529f\u80fd\u7684\u8f6c\u5f52\u3002\u7ed3\u679c: \u4e0d\u540c\u80ce\u9f84\u4e24\u7ec4\u65e9\u4ea7\u513f\u968f\u8bbf\u81f3\u77eb\u6b63\u5e74\u9f8412\u6708\u9f84\u65f6\uff0c\u4f53\u683c\u53d1\u80b2\u6307\u6807\uff08\u8eab\u957f\u3001\u4f53\u91cd\u3001\u5934\u56f4\uff09\u6bd4\u8f83\u5dee\u5f02\u65e0\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u610f\u4e49\uff08P>0.05\uff09\u300228\u5468\u2264\u80ce\u9f84<32\u5468\u548c32\u5468\u2264\u80ce\u9f84<34\u5468\u65e9\u4ea7\u513fGesell\u53d1\u80b2\u91cf\u8868\u5404\u80fd\u533a\u8bc4\u5206\u968f\u8bbf\u81f3\u77eb\u6b63\u5e74\u9f8412\u6708\u9f84\u65f6\uff0c\u5728\u89c2\u5bdf\u7ec4\u548c\u5bf9\u7167\u7ec4\u95f4\u6bd4\u8f83\u5dee\u5f02\u65e0\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u610f\u4e49\uff08P>0.05\uff09\u300234\u5468\u2264\u80ce\u9f84<37\u5468\u65e9\u4ea7\u513f\uff0c\u89c2\u5bdf\u7ec4\u7684\u5927\u8fd0\u52a8\u80fd\u8bc4\u5206\u57283\u6708\u9f84\u548c12\u6708\u9f84\u65f6\u4f4e\u4e8e\u5bf9\u7167\u7ec4\uff0c\u7cbe\u7ec6\u52a8\u4f5c\u80fd\u3001\u8bed\u8a00\u80fd\u3001\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u80fd\u8bc4\u5206\u572812\u6708\u9f84\u65f6\u5747\u4f4e\u4e8e\u5bf9\u7167\u7ec4\uff08P<0.05\uff09\uff1b\u4e2a\u4eba-\u793e\u4f1a\u6027\u80fd\u8bc4\u5206\u57283\u6708\u9f84\u65f6\u4f4e\u4e8e\u5bf9\u7167\u7ec4\uff08P<0.05\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u572812\u6708\u9f84\u65f6\u4e0e\u5bf9\u7167\u7ec4\u6bd4\u8f83\u5dee\u5f02\u65e0\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u610f\u4e49\uff08P>0.05\uff09\u3002\u7532\u72b6\u817a\u529f\u80fd\u5f02\u5e38\u65e9\u4ea7\u513f\u7ed9\u4e88\u5de6\u65cb\u7532\u72b6\u817a\u7d20\u94a0\u7247\u6cbb\u7597\uff0c2~4\u5468\u7532\u72b6\u817a\u529f\u80fd\u5747\u6062\u590d\u6b63\u5e38\uff0c\u7532\u72b6\u817a\u529f\u80fd\u6062\u590d\u6b63\u5e38\u5e76\u5b8c\u5168\u505c\u836f\u7684\u60a3\u513f\u670921\u4f8b\uff0868%\uff09\uff0c\u5176\u65b0\u751f\u513f\u75be\u75c5\u7b5b\u67e5\u7ed3\u679c\u5747\u6b63\u5e38\uff08100%\uff09\uff1b\u672a\u80fd\u505c\u836f\u60a3\u513f10\u4f8b\uff0832%\uff09\uff0c\u4ec52\u4f8b\u7b5b\u67e5\u7ed3\u679c\u6b63\u5e38\uff0c\u4e0e\u7532\u72b6\u817a\u529f\u80fd\u6062\u590d\u6b63\u5e38\u5e76\u5b8c\u5168\u505c\u836f\u60a3\u513f\u7684\u65b0\u751f\u513f\u75be\u75c5\u7b5b\u67e5\u7ed3\u679c\u6bd4\u8f83\u5dee\u5f02\u6709\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u610f\u4e49\uff08P<0.05\uff09\u3002\u7ed3\u8bba: \u7532\u72b6\u817a\u529f\u80fd\u5f02\u5e38\u65e9\u4ea7\u513f\u53ca\u65e9\u8bca\u65ad\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u5408\u7406\u89c4\u8303\u7684\u6cbb\u7597\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u4e00\u5b9a\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0a\u51cf\u5c11\u5bf9\u751f\u957f\u53d1\u80b2\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u65e9\u4ea7\u513f\u7532\u72b6\u817a\u529f\u80fd\u5f02\u5e38\u591a\u4e3a\u6682\u65f6\u6027\uff0c\u65b0\u751f\u513f\u7b5b\u67e5\u7ed3\u679c\u5448\u9633\u6027\u7684\u65e9\u4ea7\u513f\u53d1\u5c55\u4e3a\u6c38\u4e45\u6027\u7532\u72b6\u817a\u529f\u80fd\u5f02\u5e38\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u5927\u3002.\nTo study the effect of levothyroxine sodium tablets on the growth and development and thyroid function in preterm infants with thyroid dysfunction.\nA retrospective analysis was performed for 82 preterm infants who were born in the Department of Obstetrics of the First People's Hospital of Yunnan Province, from January 1, 2013 to December 31, 2017, and these infants were hospitalized after birth in the Department of Neonatology of the hospital. They were regularly followed up to observe growth and development and thyroid function at the outpatient service of the Department of Neonatology. According to thyroid function test results, they were divided into an abnormal thyroid function group (observation group; n=31) and a normal thyroid function group (control group; n=51). The infants in the observation group were given oral administration of levothyroxine sodium tablets, while those in the control group were not given any treatment. The two groups were compared in terms of the physical and intelligence development and thyroid function of preterm infants with various gestational ages (28-<32 weeks, 32-<34 weeks, and 34-<37 weeks) after regular follow-up to the corrected age of 12 months.\nThere were no significant differences in physical development indices (body length, body weight, and head circumference) between the observation and control groups at various gestational ages after follow-up to the corrected age of 12 months (P>0.05). There were no significant differences between the two groups in the scores of each functional area of the Gesell Developmental Scale among the preterm infants with a gestational age of 28-<32 weeks and 32-<34 weeks after follow-up to the corrected age of 12 months (P>0.05). For the preterm infants with a gestational age of 34-<37 weeks, compared with the control group, the observation group had a significantly lower score of gross motor ability at the age of 3 and 12 months, significantly lower scores of fine motor ability, language ability, and adaptation ability at the age of 12 months (P<0.05), and a significantly lower score of personal-social ability at the age of 3 months (P<0.05). However, the score of personal-social ability in the observation group was not significantly different from the control group at the age of 12 months (P>0.05). After 2-4 weeks of treatment with levothyroxine sodium tablets, the thyroid function of the 31 preterm infants with thyroid dysfunction returned to normal. Among the 31 infants, 21 (68%) achieved complete drug withdrawal, with normal results of neonatal screening (100%); 10 infants (32%) failed to achieve drug withdrawal, and only 2 (20%) out of the 10 infants had normal neonatal screening results (P<0.05).\nEarly diagnosis and reasonable treatment can reduce the impact on growth and development in preterm infants with thyroid dysfunction. Most preterm infants tend to have transient thyroid dysfunction, while those with positive results of neonatal screening are more likely to develop permanent thyroid dysfunction.", "Screening for ocular anomalies using fundus photography is key to prevent vision impairment and blindness. With the growing and aging population, automated algorithms that can triage fundus photographs and provide instant referral decisions are relevant to scale-up screening and face the shortage of ophthalmic expertise.\nThis study aimed to develop a deep learning algorithm that detects any ocular anomaly in fundus photographs and to evaluate this algorithm for \"normal versus anomalous\" eye examination classification in the diabetic and general populations.\nThe deep learning algorithm was developed and evaluated in two populations: the diabetic and general populations. Our patient cohorts consist of 37,129 diabetic patients from the OPHDIAT diabetic retinopathy screening network in Paris, France, and 7356 general patients from the OphtaMaine private screening network, in Le Mans, France. Each data set was divided into a development subset and a test subset of more than 4000 examinations each. For ophthalmologist/algorithm comparison, a subset of 2014 examinations from the OphtaMaine test subset was labeled by a second ophthalmologist. First, the algorithm was trained on the OPHDIAT development subset. Then, it was fine-tuned on the OphtaMaine development subset.\nOn the OPHDIAT test subset, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for normal versus anomalous classification was 0.9592. On the OphtaMaine test subset, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.8347 before fine-tuning and 0.9108 after fine-tuning. On the ophthalmologist/algorithm comparison subset, the second ophthalmologist achieved a specificity of 0.8648 and a sensitivity of 0.6682. For the same specificity, the fine-tuned algorithm achieved a sensitivity of 0.8248.\nThe proposed algorithm compares favorably with human performance for normal versus anomalous eye examination classification using fundus photography. Artificial intelligence, which previously targeted a few retinal pathologies, can be used to screen for ocular anomalies comprehensively.", "The aim of this study was to evaluate the long-term sequelae and cognitive profiles resulting from severe hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) with central nervous system (CNS) involvement.\n294 HFMD cases were included in a retrospective follow-up study. Physical examinations were conducted. The Chinese Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence, Fourth Edition (WPPSI-IV) was used to assess intelligence.\n58 mild HFMD cases and 99 severe HFMD cases with mild CNS involvement did not present any neurological sequelae. In comparison, the sequelae incidence for severe HFMD with more severe CNS complications was 50.0%. The proportion of full-scale intelligence quotient (FSIQ) impairment was 45.0%. In the 2:6-3:11 age group, severe HFMD with more severe CNS complications and lower maternal education level were risk factors for verbal comprehension disorder. Urban-rural residence and lower paternal education level were risk factors for FSIQ disorder. Furthermore, in the 4:0-6:11 age group, severe HFMD with more severe CNS complication was a risk factor for visual spatial disorder and fluid reasoning disorder. Lower paternal education level was a risk factor for FSIQ disorder.\nEarly assessment and intervention among severe HFMD patients with more severe CNS involvement at a very young age will prove beneficial for their future performance.", "Glucocorticoids and inflammatory markers can influence cognitive function. Hair cortisol concentrations (HCC) reflect longer-term hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis function and combined with immune markers can provide insights into how HPA-axis and immune pathways interact to influence cognition. We examined the association between HCC and high sensitivity c-reactive protein (hsCRP) levels, as well as the interaction between HCC and hsCRP, and cognitive function in a sample of 153 females, aged between 18 and 79 years, from a cross-sectional case-control study (SHARED ROOTS), conducted in Cape Town, South Africa from May 2014 until June 2017. We examined whether HCC and hsCRP levels were associated with performance on neurocognitive tests in both unadjusted and adjusted linear regression models. HCC demonstrated a significant inverse association with verbal working memory in both unadjusted (p\u00a0=\u00a00.010) and adjusted (p\u00a0=\u00a00.016) analyses. There were significant interactions between HCC and hsCRP on verbal intelligence (p\u00a0=\u00a00.016), language (p\u00a0=\u00a00.023) and executive function (p\u00a0=\u00a00.008) scores, such that at low HCC hsCRP levels were positively associated with language (p\u00a0=\u00a00.020) and executive function (p\u00a0=\u00a00.006) scores and at high HCC hsCRP levels were inversely associated with verbal intelligence (p\u00a0=\u00a00.034) scores. Though the results did not survive correction for multiple comparisons, they suggest stress-related neuroendocrine effects on working memory impairment. Furthermore, under physiological conditions and low long-term HCC, there may be positive effects of peripheral inflammatory markers on cognitive performance, whereas there may be detrimental effects when the HPA-axis is dysregulated as reflected by high long-term cortisol output.", "If the progress made so far allows to save more and more lives, the resuscitation of 2021 is still a young medical speciality and in full evolution. Major advances are expected in terms of early rehabilitation, practices aided by artificial intelligence, etc. The integration of the ethical dimension in the care for a more human resuscitation and the appropriate training of nurses in this specialty are also essential assets for the future of resuscitation.", "Certain types of artificial intelligence (AI), that is, deep learning models, can outperform health care professionals in particular domains. Such models hold considerable promise for improved diagnostics, treatment, and prevention, as well as more cost-efficient health care. They are, however, opaque in the sense that their exact reasoning cannot be fully explicated. Different stakeholders have emphasized the importance of the transparency/explainability of AI decision making. Transparency/explainability may come at the cost of performance. There is need for a public policy regulating the use of AI in health care that balances the societal interests in high performance as well as in transparency/explainability. A public policy should consider the wider public's interests in such features of AI.\nThis study elicited the public's preferences for the performance and explainability of AI decision making in health care and determined whether these preferences depend on respondent characteristics, including trust in health and technology and fears and hopes regarding AI.\nWe conducted a choice-based conjoint survey of public preferences for attributes of AI decision making in health care in a representative sample of the adult Danish population. Initial focus group interviews yielded 6 attributes playing a role in the respondents' views on the use of AI decision support in health care: (1) type of AI decision, (2) level of explanation, (3) performance/accuracy, (4) responsibility for the final decision, (5) possibility of discrimination, and (6) severity of the disease to which the AI is applied. In total, 100 unique choice sets were developed using fractional factorial design. In a 12-task survey, respondents were asked about their preference for AI system use in hospitals in relation to 3 different scenarios.\nOf the 1678 potential respondents, 1027 (61.2%) participated. The respondents consider the physician having the final responsibility for treatment decisions the most important attribute, with 46.8% of the total weight of attributes, followed by explainability of the decision (27.3%) and whether the system has been tested for discrimination (14.8%). Other factors, such as gender, age, level of education, whether respondents live rurally or in towns, respondents' trust in health and technology, and respondents' fears and hopes regarding AI, do not play a significant role in the majority of cases.\nThe 3 factors that are most important to the public are, in descending order of importance, (1) that physicians are ultimately responsible for diagnostics and treatment planning, (2) that the AI decision support is explainable, and (3) that the AI system has been tested for discrimination. Public policy on AI system use in health care should give priority to such AI system use and ensure that patients are provided with information.", "An increasing number of artificial intelligence (AI) systems are being proposed in ophthalmology, motivated by the variety and amount of clinical and imaging data, as well as their potential benefits at the different stages of patient care. Despite achieving close or even superior performance to that of experts, there is a critical gap between development and integration of AI systems in ophthalmic practice. This work focuses on the importance of trustworthy AI to close that gap. We identify the main aspects or challenges that need to be considered along the AI design pipeline so as to generate systems that meet the requirements to be deemed trustworthy, including those concerning accuracy, resiliency, reliability, safety, and accountability. We elaborate on mechanisms and considerations to address those aspects or challenges, and define the roles and responsibilities of the different stakeholders involved in AI for ophthalmic care, i.e., AI developers, reading centers, healthcare providers, healthcare institutions, ophthalmological societies and working groups or committees, patients, regulatory bodies, and payers. Generating trustworthy AI is not a responsibility of a sole stakeholder. There is an impending necessity for a collaborative approach where the different stakeholders are represented along the AI design pipeline, from the definition of the intended use to post-market surveillance after regulatory approval. This work contributes to establish such multi-stakeholder interaction and the main action points to be taken so that the potential benefits of AI reach real-world ophthalmic settings.", "Left atrial (LA) myopathy is common in patients with heart failure and preserved ejection fraction and leads to the development of atrial fibrillation (AF). We investigated whether the likelihood of LA remodeling, LA dysfunction, altered hemodynamics, and risk for incident AF could be identified from a single 12-lead ECG using a novel artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled ECG analysis.\nPatients with heart failure and preserved ejection fraction (n=613) underwent AI-enabled ECG analysis, echocardiography, and cardiac catheterization. Individuals were grouped by AI-enabled ECG probability of contemporaneous AF, taken as an indicator of underlying LA myopathy.\nStructural heart disease was more severe in patients with higher AI-probability of AF, with more left ventricular hypertrophy, larger LA volumes, and lower LA reservoir and booster strain. Cardiac filling pressures and pulmonary artery pressures were higher in patients with higher AI-probability, while cardiac output reserve was more impaired during exercise. Among patients with sinus rhythm and no prior AF, each 10% increase in AI-probability was associated with a 31% greater risk of developing new-onset AF (hazard ratio, 1.31 [95% CI, 1.20-1.42]; P<0.001). In the population as a whole, each 10% increase in AI-probability was associated with a 12% greater risk of death (hazard ratio, 1.12 [95% CI, 1.08-1.17]; P<0.001) during long-term follow-up, which was no longer significant after adjustments for baseline characteristics.\nA novel AI-enabled score derived from a single 12-lead ECG identifies the presence of underlying LA myopathy in patients with heart failure and preserved ejection fraction as evidenced by structural, functional, and hemodynamic abnormalities, as well as long-term risk for incident AF. Further research is required to determine the role of the AI-enabled ECG in the evaluation and care of patients with heart failure and preserved ejection fraction.", "Computational approaches have been used at different stages of drug development with the purpose of decreasing the time and cost of conventional experimental procedures. Lately, techniques mainly developed and applied in the field of artificial intelligence (AI), have been transferred to different application domains such as biomedicine.\nIn this study, we conducted an investigative analysis via data-driven evaluation of potential hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) therapeutics in the context of AI-assisted drug discovery/repurposing. First, we discussed basic concepts, computational approaches, databases, modeling approaches, and featurization techniques in drug discovery/repurposing. In the analysis part, we automatically integrated HCC-related biological entities such as genes/proteins, pathways, phenotypes, drugs/compounds, and other diseases with similar implications, and represented these heterogeneous relationships via a knowledge graph using the CROssBAR system.\nFollowing the system-level evaluation and selection of critical genes/proteins and pathways to target, our deep learning-based drug/compound-target protein interaction predictors DEEPScreen and MDeePred have been employed for predicting new bioactive drugs and compounds for these critical targets. Finally, we embedded ligands of selected HCC-associated proteins which had a significant enrichment with the CROssBAR system into a 2-D space to identify and repurpose small molecule inhibitors as potential drug candidates based on their molecular similarities to known HCC drugs.\nWe expect that these series of data-driven analyses can be used as a roadmap to propose early-stage potential inhibitors (from database-scale sets of compounds) to both HCC and other complex diseases, which may subsequently be analyzed with more targeted in silico and experimental approaches.", "The development of artificial intelligence (AI) began in the mid-20th century but has been rapidly accelerating in the past decade. Reflecting the development of digital health over the past few years, this trend is also seen in medicine. The field of cardiovascular medicine uses a wide variety and a large amount of biosignals, so there are many situations where AI can contribute. The development of AI is in progress for all aspects of the healthcare system, including the prevention, screening, and treatment of diseases and the prediction of the prognosis. AI is expected to be used to provide specialist-level medical care, even in a situation where medical resources are scarce. However, like other medical devices, the concept and mechanism of AI must be fully understood when used; otherwise, it may be used inappropriately, resulting in detriment to the patient. Therefore, it is important to understand what we need to know as a cardiologist handling AI. This review introduces the basics and principles of AI, then shows how far the current development of AI has come, and finally gives a brief introduction of how to start the AI development for those who want to develop their own AI.", "HIV incidence is increasing in eastern Europe and central Asia, primarily driven by injecting drug use. Coverage of antiretroviral therapy (ART) and opioid agonist therapy are suboptimal, with many people who inject drugs (PWID) being incarcerated. We aimed to assess whether use of monies saved as a result of decriminalisation of drug use or possession to scale up ART and opioid agonist therapy could control HIV transmission among PWID in eastern Europe and central Asia.\nA dynamic HIV transmission model among PWID incorporating incarceration, ART, and opioid agonist therapy was calibrated to Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and St Petersburg (Russia). Country-specific costs for opioid agonist therapy, ART, and incarceration were collated or estimated. Compared with baseline, the model prospectively projected the life-years gained, incremental costs (2018 euros), and infections prevented over 2020-40 for three scenarios. The decriminalisation scenario removed incarceration resulting from drug use or possession for personal use, reducing incarceration among PWID by 24\u00b78% in Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan and 46\u00b74% in St Petersburg; the public health approach scenario used savings from decriminalisation to scale up ART and opioid agonist therapy; and the full scale-up scenario included the decriminalisation scenario plus investment of additional resources to scale up ART to the UNAIDS 90-90-90 target of 81% coverage and opioid agonist therapy to the WHO target of 40% coverage. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios per life-year gained for each scenario were calculated and compared with country-specific gross domestic product per-capita willingness-to-pay thresholds. Costs and life-years gained were discounted 3% annually.\nCurrent levels of incarceration, opioid agonist therapy, and ART were estimated to cost from \u20ac198 million (95% credibility interval 173-224) in Kyrgyzstan to \u20ac4129 million (3897-4358) in Kazakhstan over 2020-40; 74\u00b78-95\u00b78% of these total costs were incarceration costs. Decriminalisation resulted in cost savings (\u20ac38-773 million due to reduced prison costs; 16\u00b79-26\u00b71% reduction in overall costs) but modest life-years gained (745-1694). The public health approach was cost saving, allowing each setting to reach 81% ART coverage and 29\u00b77-41\u00b78% coverage of opioid agonist therapy, resulting in 17\u2009768-148\u2009464 life-years gained and 58\u00b79-83\u00b77% of infections prevented. Results were similar for the full scale-up scenario.\nCost savings from decriminalisation of drug use could greatly reduce HIV transmission through increased coverage of opioid agonist therapy and ART among PWID in eastern Europe and central Asia.\nAlliance for Public Health, US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and National Institute for Drug Abuse, and Economist Intelligence Unit.", "Evaluating histologic grade for breast cancer diagnosis is standard and associated with prognostic outcomes. Current challenges include the time required for manual microscopic evaluation and interobserver variability. This study proposes a computer-aided diagnostic (CAD) pipeline for grading tumors using artificial intelligence.\nThere were 138 patients included in this retrospective study. Breast core biopsy slides were prepared using standard laboratory techniques, digitized, and pre-processed for analysis. Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) were developed to identify the regions of interest containing malignant cells and to segment tumor nuclei. Imaging-based features associated with spatial parameters were extracted from the segmented regions of interest (ROIs). Clinical datasets and pathologic biomarkers (estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and human epidermal growth factor 2) were collected from all study subjects. Pathologic, clinical, and imaging-based features were input into machine learning (ML) models to classify histologic grade, and model performances were tested against ground-truth labels at the patient-level. Classification performances were evaluated using receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis.\nMultiparametric feature sets, containing both clinical and imaging-based features, demonstrated high classification performance. Using imaging-derived markers alone, the classification performance demonstrated an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.745, while modeling these features with other pathologic biomarkers yielded an AUC of 0.836.\nThese results demonstrate an association between tumor nuclear spatial features and tumor grade. If further validated, these systems may be implemented into pathology CADs and can assist pathologists to expeditiously grade tumors at the time of diagnosis and to help guide clinical decisions.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) as an emerging technology is gaining momentum in medical imaging. Recently, deep learning-based AI techniques have been actively investigated in medical imaging, and its potential applications range from data acquisition and image reconstruction to image analysis and understanding. In this review, we focus on the use of deep learning in image reconstruction for advanced medical imaging modalities including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), and positron emission tomography (PET). Particularly, recent deep learning-based methods for image reconstruction will be emphasized, in accordance with their methodology designs and performances in handling volumetric imaging data. It is expected that this review can help relevant researchers understand how to adapt AI for medical imaging and which advantages can be achieved with the assistance of AI.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) systems have increasingly achieved expert-level performance in medical imaging applications. However, there is growing concern that such AI systems may reflect and amplify human bias, and reduce the quality of their performance in historically under-served populations such as female patients, Black patients, or patients of low socioeconomic status. Such biases are especially troubling in the context of underdiagnosis, whereby the AI algorithm would inaccurately label an individual with a disease as healthy, potentially delaying access to care. Here, we examine algorithmic underdiagnosis in chest X-ray pathology classification across three large chest X-ray datasets, as well as one multi-source dataset. We find that classifiers produced using state-of-the-art computer vision techniques consistently and selectively underdiagnosed under-served patient populations and that the underdiagnosis rate was higher for intersectional under-served subpopulations, for example, Hispanic female patients. Deployment of AI systems using medical imaging for disease diagnosis with such biases risks exacerbation of existing care biases and can potentially lead to unequal access to medical treatment, thereby raising ethical concerns for the use of these models in the clinic.", "Identifying and analyzing quality information sources of technical information is a fundamental skill to create and maintain a technological intelligence system. In the present work, we propose the intentional training of undergraduate biomedical engineering students to create a simple technological intelligence report by analyzing scientific publications and patents. Computerized Maintenance Management Systems (CMMS) focused on the medical devices industry is proposed as the central topic, results suggest that the creation of technological intelligence report generates value to the undergraduate biomedical engineering students given them a tool to identify the impact of new technology in healthcare and medical devices.", "EEG-EMG based hybrid Brain Computer Interface (hBCI) utilizes the brain-muscle physiological system to interpret and identify motor behaviors, and transmit human intelligence to automated machines in AI applications such as neurorehabilitations and brain-like intelligence. The study introduces a hBCI method for motor behaviors, where multiple time series of the brain neuromuscular network are introduced to indicate brain-muscle causal interactions, and features are extracted based on Relative Causal Strengths (RCSs) derived by Noise-assisted Multivariate Empirical Mode Decomposition (NA-MEMD) based Causal Decomposition. The complex process in brain neuromuscular interactions is specifically investigated towards a monitoring task of upper limb movement, whose 63-channel EEGs and 2-channel EMGs are composed of data inputs. The energy and frequency factors counted from RCSs were extracted as Core Features (CFs). Results showed accuracies of 91.4% and 81.4% with CFs for identifying cascaded (No Movement and Movement Execution) and 3-class (No Movement, Right Movement, and Left Movement) using Naive Bayes classifier, respectively. Moreover, those reached 100% and 94.3% when employing CFs combined with eigenvalues processed by Common Spatial Pattern (CSP). This initial work implies a novel causality inference based hBCI solution for the detection of human upper limb movement.", "The Human Exposome Assessment Platform (HEAP) is a research resource for the integrated and efficient management and analysis of human exposome data. The project will provide the complete workflow for obtaining exposome actionable knowledge from population-based cohorts.

The software, will provide a decision support system for researchers and policymakers. All the data managed and processed by HEAP, together with the analysis pipelines, will be available for future research. In addition, the platform enables adding new data and analysis pipelines. HEAP's final product can be deployed in multiple instances to create a network of shareable and reusable knowledge on the impact of exposures on public health.", "Tuberculosis is an infectious disease that is spread through the air from one person to another and is one of the top ten causes of death in the world according to the World Health Organization. From biomedical engineering, decision support systems based on artificial intelligence have shown advantages for healthcare personnel in tasks such as diagnosis and screening. A specific area of the artificial intelligence is the natural language processing, however, most of these approaches are based on available data. This paper shows the construction of a dataset based on medical records of subjects suspected of tuberculosis. In addition, an initial exploration of the contents of the constructed dataset and how this approach can be followed by a natural language processing to support tuberculosis diagnosis in data demanding scenarios are presented.Clinical Relevance- In some developing countries as Colombia, it is difficult to develop systems based on artificial intelligence due to the availability of data. This proposal holds a strategy to build a dataset to train machine learning models, and to obtain support diagnosis tools, employing natural language from the medical scenario from text written by health professionals in the medical record. In this way, trained models based on this information available can be employed in places where medical infrastructure is precarious.", "Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a useful aid in numerous clinical applications for diagnosis and treatment decisions. Deep neural networks have shown the same or better performance than clinicians in many tasks owing to the rapid increase in the available data and computational power. In order to conform to the principles of trustworthy AI, it is essential that the AI system be transparent, robust, fair, and ensure accountability. Current deep neural solutions are referred to as black-boxes due to a lack of understanding of the specifics concerning the decision-making process. Therefore, there is a need to ensure the interpretability of deep neural networks before they can be incorporated into the routine clinical workflow. In this narrative review, we utilized systematic keyword searches and domain expertise to identify nine different types of interpretability methods that have been used for understanding deep learning models for medical image analysis applications based on the type of generated explanations and technical similarities. Furthermore, we report the progress made towards evaluating the explanations produced by various interpretability methods. Finally, we discuss limitations, provide guidelines for using interpretability methods and future directions concerning the interpretability of deep neural networks for medical imaging analysis.", "Research using artificial intelligence (AI) in medicine is expected to significantly influence the practice of medicine and the delivery of health care in the near future. However, for successful deployment, the results must be transported across health care facilities. We present a cross-facilities application of an AI model that predicts the need for an emergency caesarean during birth. The transported model showed benefit; however, there can be challenges associated with interfacility variation in reporting practices.", "Our aim was to assess the tomographic presence of diabetic macular edema in type 2 diabetes patients screened for diabetic retinopathy with color fundus photographs and an artificial intelligence algorithm. Color fundus photographs obtained with a low-cost smartphone-based handheld retinal camera were analyzed by the algorithm; patients with suspected macular lesions underwent ocular coherence tomography. A total of 366 patients were screened; diabetic macular edema was suspected in 34 and confirmed in 29 individuals, with average age 60.5\u2009\u00b1\u200910.9\u00a0years and glycated hemoglobin 9.8\u2009\u00b1\u20092.4%; use of insulin, statins, and aspirin were reported in 44.8%, 37.9%, and 34.5% of individuals, respectively; systemic blood hypertension, dyslipidemia, abdominal obesity, chronic kidney disease, and risk for diabetic foot ulcers were present in 100%, 58.6%, 62.1%, 48.3%, and 27.5% of individuals, respectively. Proliferative diabetic retinopathy was present in 31% of patients with macular edema; severity level was associated with albuminuria (p\u2009=\u20090.028). Eyes with macular edema had average central macular thickness 329.89\u2009\u00b1\u200980.98\u00a0m[Formula: see text]; intraretinal cysts, sub retinal fluid, hyper-reflective foci, epiretinal membrane, and vitreomacular traction were found in 87.2%, 6.4%, 85.1%, 10.6%, and 6.4% of eyes, respectively. Diabetic retinopathy screening overwhelms health systems and is typically based on color fundus photographs, with high false-positive rates for the detection of diabetic macular edema. The present, semi-automated strategy comprising artificial intelligence algorithms integrated with smartphone-based retinal cameras could improve screening in low-resource settings with limited availability of ocular coherence tomography, allowing increased access rates and ultimately contributing to tackle preventable blindness.", "It is necessary to know the influence of the current pandemic situation on children's emotional intelligence (EI). Therefore, this study aimed to analyze the difference in 34 Spanish children's EI (aged 9-10) caused by the lockdown. EI was measured with the BarOn Emotional Intelligence Inventory (EQ-i:YV). Results have revealed a reduction in EI, specifically on intrapersonal, interpersonal, and adaptability scales (all p\u2009<\u2009.01). Thus, the study highlights the negative influence of lockdown situation on children's EI and considering the impact this may have at a cognitive, social, or academic level, it would be convenient to promote its development at school.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) is a general term that refers to the use of a machine to imitate intelligent behavior for performing complex tasks with minimal human intervention, such as machine learning; this technology is revolutionizing and reshaping medicine. AI has considerable potential to perfect health-care systems in areas such as diagnostics, risk analysis, health information administration, lifestyle supervision, and virtual health assistance. In terms of immunotherapy, AI has been applied to the prediction of immunotherapy responses based on immune signatures, medical imaging and histological analysis. These features could also be highly useful in the management of cancer immunotherapy given their ever-increasing performance in improving diagnostic accuracy, optimizing treatment planning, predicting outcomes of care and reducing human resource costs. In this review, we present the details of AI and the current progression and state of the art in employing AI for cancer immunotherapy. Furthermore, we discuss the challenges, opportunities and corresponding strategies in applying the technology for widespread clinical deployment. Finally, we summarize the impact of AI on cancer immunotherapy and provide our perspectives about underlying applications of AI in the future.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) and variant prioritization tools for genomic variant analysis are being rapidly developed for use in clinical diagnostic testing. However, their clinical utility and reliability are currently limited. Therefore, we performed a validation of a commercial AI tool (Moon) and a comprehensive reanalysis of previously collected clinical exome sequencing cases using an open-source variant prioritization tool (Exomiser) and the now-validated AI tool to test their feasibility in clinical diagnostics.\nA validation study of Moon was performed with 29 positive cases determined by previous manual analysis. After validation, reanalysis was performed on 80 previously manually analyzed nondiagnostic exome cases using Moon. Finally, a comparison between Moon and Exomiser was completed regarding their ability to identify previously completed positive cases and to identify new positive cases.\nMoon correctly selected the causal variant(s) in 97% of manually analyzed positive cases and identified 7 new positive cases. Exomiser correctly identified the causal gene in 85% of positive cases and agreed with Moon by ranking the new gene in its top 10 list 43% of the time.\nThe use of AI in diagnostic laboratories greatly enhances exome sequencing analysis by reducing analysis time and increasing the diagnostic rate.", "Bioelectrochemical systems (BESs) are highly evolved and sophisticated systems that produce bioenergy via exoelectrogenic microbes. Artificial intelligence (AI) helps to understand, relate, model, and predict both process parameters and microbial diversity, resulting in higher performance. This approach has revolutionized BESs through highly advanced computational algorithms that best suit the systems' architecture.", "The study investigates whether learners' demographics (e.g., age, education, and intelligence-IQ), language learning experience, and cognitive control predict Chinese (L2) reading comprehension in young adults. Thirty-four international students who studied mandarin Chinese in mainland China (10 females, 24 males) from Bangladesh, Burundi, Congo, Madagascar, Nigeria, Rwanda, South Africa, and Zimbabwe were tested on a series of measures including demographic questionnaires, IQ test, two cognitive control tasks [Flanker Task measuring inhibition and Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) measuring mental set shifting], and a Chinese reading comprehension test (HSK level 4). The results of correlation analyses showed that education, L2 learning history, L2 proficiency, and previous category errors of the WCST were significantly correlated with Chinese reading comprehension. Further multiple regression analyses indicated that Chinese learning history, IQ, and previous category errors of the WCST significantly predicted Chinese reading comprehension. These findings reveal that aside from IQ and the time spent on L2 learning, the component mental set shifting of cognitive control also predicts reading outcomes, which suggests that cognitive control has a place in reading comprehension models over and above traditional predictors of language learning experience.", "The continued generation of large amounts of data within healthcare-from imaging to electronic medical health records to genomics and multi-omics -necessitates tools and methods to parse and interpret these data to improve healthcare outcomes. Artificial intelligence, and in particular deep learning, has enabled researchers to gain new insights from large scale and multimodal data. At the 2022 Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing (PSB) session entitled \"Precision Medicine: Using Artificial Intelligence to Improve Diagnostics and Healthcare\", we showcase the latest research, influenced and inspired by the idea of using technology to build a more fair, tailored, and cost-effective healthcare system after the COVID-19 pandemic.", "Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) is a technology that uses electroencephalographic (EEG) signals to control external devices, such as Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES). Visual BCI paradigms based on P300 and Steady State Visually Evoked potentials (SSVEP) have shown high potential for clinical purposes. Numerous studies have been published on P300- and SSVEP-based non-invasive BCIs, but many of them present two shortcomings: (1) they are not aimed for motor rehabilitation applications, and (2) they do not report in detail the artificial intelligence (AI) methods used for classification, or their performance metrics. To address this gap, in this paper the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) methodology was applied to prepare a systematic literature review (SLR). Papers older than 10 years, repeated or not related to a motor rehabilitation application, were excluded. Of all the studies, 51.02% referred to theoretical analysis of classification algorithms. Of the remaining, 28.48% were for spelling, 12.73% for diverse applications (control of wheelchair or home appliances), and only 7.77% were focused on motor rehabilitation. After the inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied and quality screening was performed, 34 articles were selected. Of them, 26.47% used the P300 and 55.8% the SSVEP signal. Five applications categories were established: Rehabilitation Systems (17.64%), Virtual Reality environments (23.52%), FES (17.64%), Orthosis (29.41%), and Prosthesis (11.76%). Of all the works, only four performed tests with patients. The most reported machine learning (ML) algorithms used for classification were linear discriminant analysis (LDA) (48.64%) and support vector machine (16.21%), while only one study used a deep learning algorithm: a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The reported accuracy ranged from 38.02 to 100%, and the Information Transfer Rate from 1.55 to 49.25 bits per minute. While LDA is still the most used AI algorithm, CNN has shown promising results, but due to their high technical implementation requirements, many researchers do not justify its implementation as worthwile. To achieve quick and accurate online BCIs for motor rehabilitation applications, future works on SSVEP-, P300-based and hybrid BCIs should focus on optimizing the visual stimulation module and the training stage of ML and DL algorithms.", "COVID-19 is an acute severe respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. After its first appearance in Wuhan (China), it spread rapidly across the world and became a pandemic. It had a devastating effect on everyday life, public health, and the world economy. The use of advanced artificial intelligence (AI) techniques combined with radiological imaging can be helpful in speeding-up the detection of this disease. In this study, we propose the development of recent deep learning models for automatic COVID-19 detection using computed tomography (CT) images. The proposed models are fine-tuned and optimized to provide accurate results for multiclass classification of COVID-19 vs. Community Acquired Pneumonia (CAP) vs. Normal cases. Tests were conducted both at the image and patient-level and show that the proposed algorithms achieve very high scores. In addition, an explainability algorithm was developed to help visualize the symptoms of the disease detected by the best performing deep model.", "Weeds are a persistent problem on sod farms, and herbicides to control different weed species are one of the largest chemical inputs. Recent advances in unmanned aerial systems (UAS) and artificial intelligence provide opportunities for weed mapping on sod farms. This study investigates the weed type composition and area through both ground and UAS-based weed surveys and trains a convolutional neural network (CNN) for identifying and mapping weeds in sod fields using UAS-based imagery and a high-level application programming interface (API) implementation (Fastai) of the PyTorch deep learning library. The performance of the CNN was overall similar to, and in some classes (broadleaf and spurge) better than, human eyes indicated by the metric recall. In general, the CNN detected broadleaf, grass weeds, spurge, sedge, and no weeds at a precision between 0.68 and 0.87, 0.57 and 0.82, 0.68 and 0.83, 0.66 and 0.90, and 0.80 and 0.88, respectively, when using UAS images at 0.57 cm-1.28 cm pixel-1 resolution. Recall ranges for the five classes were 0.78-0.93, 0.65-0.87, 0.82-0.93, 0.52-0.79, and 0.94-0.99. Additionally, this study demonstrates that a CNN can achieve precision and recall above 0.9 at detecting different types of weeds during turf establishment when the weeds are mature. The CNN is limited by the image resolution, and more than one model may be needed in practice to improve the overall performance of weed mapping.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) can make advanced inferences based on a large amount of data. The mainstream technologies of the AI boom in 2021 are machine learning (ML) and deep learning, which have made significant progress due to the increase in computational resources accompanied by the dramatic improvement in computer performance. In this review, we introduce AI/ML-based medical devices and prediction models regarding diabetes.\nIn the field of diabetes, several AI-/ML-based medical devices and regarding automatic retinal screening, clinical diagnosis support, and patient self-management tool have already been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. As for new-onset diabetes prediction using ML methods, its performance is not superior to conventional risk stratification models that use statistical approaches so far. Despite the current situation, it is expected that the predictive performance of AI will soon be maximized by a large amount of organized data and abundant computational resources, which will contribute to a dramatic improvement in the accuracy of disease prediction models for diabetes.", "The electronic vaccine intelligence network (eVIN) was introduced by India's Ministry of Health and Family Welfare in 12 states and was implemented by the United Nations Development Programme through the Gavi health system strengthening support during 2014-17 to replace the traditional paper-based cold-chain management system with an electronic vaccine logistics management system. An economic assessment was conducted as part of the overall assessment of eVIN. The objective of the economic assessment was to conduct a return on investment analysis of eVIN implementation. Return on investment was defined as the ratio of total benefits (savings) from eVIN to total investment in eVIN. All costs were calculated in 2020 prices and reported in Indian rupees (1 US dollar\u00a0=\u00a0INR 74.132). A one-rupee investment in eVIN led to a return of INR 0.52 for traditional vaccines. The highest cost savings from eVIN was from better vaccine stock management. When same percentage of savings from the new vaccines were incorporated into the analysis, one-rupee investment in eVIN led to a return of INR 1.41. In the future, when only recurrent costs will exist, the return from eVIN will be even higher: a one-rupee investment in eVIN will yield a return of INR 2.93. The assessment of eVIN showed promising results in streamlining the vaccine flow network and ensuring equity in vaccine stock management along with good return on investment; hence, there was a rapid expansion of eVIN in all 731 districts across 36 states and union territories in the country.", "An explainable Artificial Intelligence (xAI) approach is proposed to longitudinally monitor subjects affected by Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) by using high-density electroencephalography (HD-EEG). To this end, a group of MCI patients was enrolled at IRCCS Centro Neurolesi Bonino Pulejo of Messina (Italy) within a follow-up protocol that included two evaluations steps: T0 (first evaluation) and T1 (three months later). At T1, four MCI patients converted to Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and were included in the analysis as the goal of this work was to use xAI to detect individual changes in EEGs possibly related to the degeneration from MCI to AD. The proposed methodology consists in mapping segments of HD-EEG into channel-frequency maps by means of the power spectral density. Such maps are used as input to a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), trained to label the maps as \"T0\" (MCI state) or \"T1\" (AD state). Experimental results reported high intra-subject classification performance (accuracy rate up to 98.97% (95% confidence interval: 98.68-99.26)). Subsequently, the explainability of the proposed CNN is explored via a Grad-CAM approach. The procedure detected which EEG-channels (i.e., head region) and range of frequencies (i.e., sub-bands) were more active in the progression to AD. The xAI analysis showed that the main information is included in the delta sub-band and that, limited to the analyzed dataset, the highest relevant areas are: the left-temporal and central-frontal lobe for Sb01, the parietal lobe for Sb02, the left-frontal lobe for Sb03 and the left-frontotemporal region for Sb04.", "We discuss the practical employment of a machine learning (ML) technique within AI for a social good application. We present an application for elderly adult dementia onset prognostication. First, the paper explains our encouraging preliminary study results of EEG responses analysis using a signal complexity measure of multiscale entropy (MSE) in reminiscent interior working memory evaluation tasks. Then, we compare shallow and deep learning machine learning models for a digital biomarker of dementia onset detection. The evaluated machine-learning models succeed in the most reliable median accuracies above 80% using random forest and fully connected neural network classifiers in automatic discrimination of normal cognition versus a mild cognitive impairment (MCI) task. The classifier input features consist of MSE patterns only derived from four dry EEG electrodes. Fifteen elderly subjects voluntarily participate in the reported study focusing on EEG-based objective dementia biomarker advancement. The results showcase the essential social advantages of artificial intelligence (AI) application for the dementia prognosis and advance ML for the subsequent use for simple objective EEG-based examination.Clinical relevance- This manuscript introduces an objective biomarker from EEG recorded by a wearable for a plausible replacement of a mild cognitive impairment (MCI) evaluation using usual biased paper and pencil examinations.", "As the last decade of human genomics research begins to bear the fruit of advancements in precision medicine, it is important to ensure that genomics' improvements in human health are distributed globally and equitably. An important step to ensuring health equity is to improve the human reference genome to capture global diversity by including a wide variety of alternative haplotypes, sequences that are not currently captured on the reference genome.We present a method that localizes 100 basepair (bp) long sequences extracted from short-read sequencing that can ultimately be used to identify what regions of the human genome non-reference sequences belong to.We extract reads that don't align to the reference genome, and compute the population's distribution of 100-mers found within the unmapped reads. We use genetic data from families to identify shared genetic material between siblings and match the distribution of unmapped k-mers to these inheritance patterns to determine the the most likely genomic region of a k-mer. We perform this localization with two highly interpretable methods of artificial intelligence: a computationally tractable Hidden Markov Model coupled to a Maximum Likelihood Estimator. Using a set of alternative haplotypes with known locations on the genome, we show that our algorithm is able to localize 96% of k-mers with over 90% accuracy and less than 1Mb median resolution. As the collection of sequenced human genomes grows larger and more diverse, we hope that this method can be used to improve the human reference genome, a critical step in addressing precision medicine's diversity crisis.", "To what extent, if any, should the law protect sentient artificial intelligence (that is, AI that can feel pleasure or pain)? Here we surveyed United States adults (n = 1,061) on their views regarding granting 1) general legal protection, 2) legal personhood, and 3) standing to bring forth a lawsuit, with respect to sentient AI and eight other groups: humans in the jurisdiction, humans outside the jurisdiction, corporations, unions, non-human animals, the environment, humans living in the near future, and humans living in the far future. Roughly one-third of participants endorsed granting personhood and standing to sentient AI (assuming its existence) in at least some cases, the lowest of any group surveyed on, and rated the desired level of protection for sentient AI as lower than all groups other than corporations. We further investigated and observed political differences in responses; liberals were more likely to endorse legal protection and personhood for sentient AI than conservatives. Taken together, these results suggest that laypeople are not by-and-large in favor of granting legal protection to AI, and that the ordinary conception of legal status, similar to codified legal doctrine, is not based on a mere capacity to feel pleasure and pain. At the same time, the observed political differences suggest that previous literature regarding political differences in empathy and moral circle expansion apply to artificially intelligent systems and extend partially, though not entirely, to legal consideration, as well.", "Optimal outcomes after large-vessel occlusion (LVO) stroke are highly dependent on prompt diagnosis, effective communication, and treatment, making LVO an attractive avenue for the application of artificial intelligence (AI), specifically machine learning (ML). Our objective is to conduct a systematic review to describe existing AI applications for LVO strokes, delineate its effectiveness, and identify areas for future AI applications in stroke treatment and prognostication.\nA systematic review was conducted by searching the PubMed, Embase, and Scopus databases. After deduplication, studies were screened by title and abstract. Full-text studies were screened for final inclusion based on prespecified inclusion and exclusion criteria. Relevant data were extracted from each study.\nOf 11,512 resultant articles, 40 were included. Of 30 studies with reported ML algorithms, the most commonly used ML algorithms were convolutional neural networks in 10 (33.3%), support vector machines in 10 (33.0%), and random forests in 9 (30.0%). Studies examining triage favored direct transport to a stroke center and predicted improved outcomes. ML techniques proved vastly accurate in identifying LVO on computed tomography. Applications of AI to patient selection for thrombectomy are lacking, although some studies determine individual patient eligibility for endovascular treatment with high accuracy. ML algorithms have reasonable accuracy in predicting clinical and angiographic outcomes and associated factors.\nAI has shown promise in the diagnosis and triage of patients with acute stroke. However, the role of AI in the management and prognostication remains limited and warrants further research to help in decision support.", "Supporting clinician mental health and well-being must start in the learning environment, especially as health profession students have been shown to have higher rates of mental illness than their peers pursuing other careers. This project aimed to support positive mental health in pharmacy students through small changes that faculty implemented both inside and outside of the classroom.\nIn partnership with the Counseling and Mental Health Center, faculty received training, resources, and (in some cases) classroom observation and feedback on how to incorporate small changes that support student well-being. Assessments were performed each semester beginning in spring 2018 and ending in spring 2020. These included the Mental Health Continuum - Short Form (measuring positive mental health and well-being), the Theories of Intelligence Scale - Self Form for Adults (measuring growth mindset), the Sense of Belonging Scale (measuring five domains of social connectedness), and the Brief Resilience Scale (measuring resilience). Participating faculty were surveyed regarding how frequently selected activities were incorporated into their practice and how comfortable they felt supporting student mental health.\nPositive trends were seen throughout the project on the scales assessing growth mindset and sense of belonging.\nSupporting positive mental health in pharmacy students in the learning environment is important for both students and the quality and safety of the health care system. Future efforts should expand on this work by refining the measurements used, identifying more interventions, and evaluating the impact these efforts have as students become pharmacists.", "The Intensive Care Unit (ICU) is an important unit for the rescue of critically ill patients in hospitals, and patient mortality is an important indicator to measure the level of ICU treatment. Currently, a variety of clinical scoring systems are used to evaluate the patient's condition and predict survival, but these systems require a lot of resources. However, due to the rapid development of artificial intelligence and deep learning, machine learning based methods have been used to study the survival prediction of ICU patients. Additionally, these methods have made significant progress, but there is still a distance from clinical application, and equally metric interpretability of the deep learning method is not very mature. Therefore, in this paper, we have proposed a predicting model for the life and death of ICU patients, which is primarily based on the Fuzzy ARTMAP model. With a thorough analysis of the existing ICU patient condition assessment and life and death prediction methods, we have observed that patient's ICU monitoring information performs integrated analysis and extracts features according to the clinical characteristics of physiological indicators. Finally, fuzzy ARTMAP neural network is used to predict the life and death of patients. Likewise, prediction results are combined with the clinical scoring system and logistic regression, artificial neural network, support vector machine, and AdaBoost. Experimental results of these algorithms were compared, which verifies that the proposed method has outperformed the existing model. The main purpose of the proposed mode is to design a life and death prediction method for ICU patients, which has high predictive performance and is an acceptable method for clinical medical staff, where ICU monitoring data is used. Experimental results show that the method proposed has achieved better prediction performance and accuracy ratio, which provide theoretical reference for clinical application.", "Patients with schizophrenia can exhibit intelligence decline, which is an important element of cognitive impairment. Previous magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have demonstrated that patients with schizophrenia have altered gray matter structures and functional connectivity associated with intelligence decline defined by a difference between premorbid and current intelligence quotients (IQs). However, it has remained unclear whether white matter microstructures are related to intelligence decline. In the present study, the indices of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) obtained from 138 patients with schizophrenia and 554 healthy controls were analyzed. The patients were classified into three subgroups based on intelligence decline: deteriorated (94 patients), preserved (42 patients), and compromised IQ (2 patients) groups. Given that the DTI of each subject was acquired using either one of two different MRI scanners, we analyzed DTI indices separately for each scanner group. In the comparison between the deteriorated IQ group and the healthy controls, differences in some DTI indices were noted in three regions of interest irrespective of the MRI scanners, whereas differences in only one region of interest were noted between the preserved IQ group and the healthy controls. However, the comparisons between the deteriorated and preserved IQ groups did not show any reproducible differences. Together with the previous findings, it is thought that gray matter structures and functional connectivity are more promising as markers of intelligence decline in schizophrenia than white matter microstructures.", "Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are two of the most represented neurodevelopmental conditions in childhood. The diagnostic shift introduced by the DSM-5, allowing a combined diagnosis of ADHD and ASD, poses different clinical challenges related to diagnostic overshadowing, accuracy of clinical judgment and potential delay in an ASD diagnosis in children presenting with ADHD. Here we tried to disentangle the clinical phenotype and specificity of the two co-occurring conditions in relation to autism traits and empathy, by comparing children with ASD with and without comorbid ADHD with children presenting ADHD only and children with typical development. The child versions of the Autism Quotient (C-AQ) and Empathy Quotient (C-EQ) were administered to a total sample of 198 male children between 6 and 14 years old with age appropriate language skills and normal intelligence. Univariate analysis demonstrated no significant differences in the C-AQ total and subscale scores as well as the C-EQ between children with ASD and children with ASD + ADHD, while children with ADHD alone presented an intermediate phenotype between ASD and TD. Furthermore, a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was applied to discriminate among the different phenotypes. We found that the C-AQ and C-EQ were accurate at distinguishing with satisfactory reliability between: (a) ASD vs. non- ASD (N-ASD) groups comprising both ADHD and TD children (Area Under the Curve AUC 88% for C-AQ and 81% for C-EQ); (b) ASD and TD (AUC 92% for C-AQ and 95% for C-EQ); (c) ASD and ADHD (AUC 80% for C-AQ and 68% for C-EQ). Our data confirm the reliability of the C-AQ and C-EQ as behavioral markers to differentiate ASD (regardless of comorbid ADHD) from an ADHD condition and TD. Interestingly, in our sample an ADHD condition does not increase the severity of the clinical phenotype in terms of autism traits distribution and empathy, suggesting that the psychological measures detected by the two quantitative instruments are independent of ADHD traits. This evidence will contribute to the translational efforts in developing better tailored treatments and preventive strategies.", "The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and ensuing social restrictions has been profound, affecting the health, livelihoods, and wellbeing of populations worldwide. Studies have shown widespread effects on mental health, with an increase in stress, loneliness, and depression symptoms related to the pandemic. Media plays a critical role in containing and managing crises, by informing society and fostering positive behavior change. Social restrictions have led to a large increase in reliance on online media channels, and this can influence mental health and wellbeing. Anxiety levels, for instance, may be exacerbated by exposure to COVID-related content, contagion of negative sentiment among social networks, and \"fake news.\" In some cases, this may trigger abstinence, leading to isolation and limited access to vital information. To be able to communicate distressing news during crises while protecting the wellbeing of individuals is not trivial; it requires a deeper understanding of people's emotional response to online and social media content. This paper selectively reviews research into consequences of social media usage and online news consumption for wellbeing and mental health, focusing on and discussing their effects in the context of the pandemic. Advances in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science, for example, Natural Language Processing, Sentiment Analysis, and Emotion Recognition, are discussed as useful methods for investigating effects on population mental health as the pandemic situation evolves. We present suggestions for future research, and for using these advances to assess large data sets of users' online content, to potentially inform strategies that enhance the mental health of social media users going forward.", "The automated recognition of human emotions plays an important role in developing machines with emotional intelligence. However, most of the affective computing models are based on images, audio, videos and brain signals. There is a lack of prior studies that focus on utilizing only peripheral physiological signals for emotion recognition, which can ideally be implemented in daily life settings using wearables, e.g., smartwatches. Here, an emotion classification method using peripheral physiological signals, obtained by wearable devices that enable continuous monitoring of emotional states, is presented. A Long Short-Term Memory neural network-based classification model is proposed to accurately predict emotions in real-time into binary levels and quadrants of the arousal-valence space. The peripheral sensored data used here were collected from 20 participants, who engaged in a naturalistic debate. Different annotation schemes were adopted and their impact on the classification performance was explored. Evaluation results demonstrate the capability of our method with a measured accuracy of >93% and >89% for binary levels and quad classes, respectively. This paves the way for enhancing the role of wearable devices in emotional state recognition in everyday life.", "Deep learning belongs to the field of artificial intelligence, where machines perform tasks that typically require some kind of human intelligence. Deep learning tries to achieve this by drawing inspiration from the learning of a human brain. Similar to the basic structure of a brain, which consists of (billions of) neurons and connections between them, a deep learning algorithm consists of an artificial neural network, which resembles the biological brain structure. Mimicking the learning process of humans with their senses, deep learning networks are fed with (sensory) data, like texts, images, videos or sounds. These networks outperform the state-of-the-art methods in different tasks and, because of this, the whole field saw an exponential growth during the last years. This growth resulted in way over 10,000 publications per year in the last years. For example, the search engine PubMed alone, which covers only a sub-set of all publications in the medical field, provides already over 11,000 results in Q3 2020 for the search term 'deep learning', and around 90% of these results are from the last three years. Consequently, a complete overview over the field of deep learning is already impossible to obtain and, in the near future, it will potentially become difficult to obtain an overview over a subfield. However, there are several review articles about deep learning, which are focused on specific scientific fields or applications, for example deep learning advances in computer vision or in specific tasks like object detection. With these surveys as a foundation, the aim of this contribution is to provide a first high-level, categorized meta-survey of selected reviews on deep learning across different scientific disciplines and outline the research impact that they already have during a short period of time. The categories (computer vision, language processing, medical informatics and additional works) have been chosen according to the underlying data sources (image, language, medical, mixed). In addition, we review the common architectures, methods, pros, cons, evaluations, challenges and future directions for every sub-category.", "Various studies have investigated cognitive mechanisms underlying culture in humans and other great apes. However, the adaptive reasons for the evolution of uniquely sophisticated cumulative culture in our species remain unclear. We propose that the cultural capabilities of humans are the evolutionary result of a stepwise transition from the ape-like lifestyle of earlier hominins to the foraging niche still observed in extant hunter-gatherers. Recent ethnographic, archaeological and genetic studies have provided compelling evidence that the components of the foraging niche (social egalitarianism, sexual and social division of labour, extensive co-residence and cooperation with unrelated individuals, multilocality, fluid sociality and high between-camp mobility) engendered a unique multilevel social structure where the cognitive mechanisms underlying cultural evolution (high-fidelity transmission, innovation, teaching, recombination, ratcheting) evolved as adaptations. Therefore, multilevel sociality underlies a 'social ratchet' or irreversible task specialization splitting the burden of cultural knowledge across individuals, which may explain why human collective intelligence is uniquely able to produce sophisticated cumulative culture. The foraging niche perspective may explain why a complex gene-culture dual inheritance system evolved uniquely in humans and interprets the cultural, morphological and genetic origins of Homo sapiens as a process of recombination of innovations appearing in differentiated but interconnected populations. This article is part of a discussion meeting issue 'The emergence of collective knowledge and cumulative culture in animals, humans and machines'.", "Upper gastrointestinal (GI) neoplasia account for 35% of GI cancers and 1.5 million cancer-related deaths every year. Despite its efficacy in preventing cancer mortality, diagnostic upper GI endoscopy is affected by a substantial miss rate of neoplastic lesions due to failure to recognize a visible lesion or imperfect navigation. This may be offset by the real-time application of artificial intelligence (AI) for detection (computer-aided detection [CADe]) and characterization (computer-aided diagnosis [CADx]) of upper GI neoplasia. Stand-alone performance of CADe for esophageal squamous cell neoplasia, Barrett's esophagus-related neoplasia, and gastric cancer showed promising accuracy, sensitivity ranging between 83% and 93%. However, incorporation of CADe/CADx in clinical practice depends on several factors, such as possible bias in the training or validation phases of these algorithms, its interaction with human endoscopists, and clinical implications of false-positive results. The aim of this review is to guide the clinician across the multiple steps of AI development in clinical practice.", "Despite significant improvements in contemporary machine learning, symbolic methods currently outperform artificial neural networks on tasks that involve compositional reasoning, such as goal-directed planning and logical inference. This illustrates a computational explanatory gap between cognitive and neurocomputational algorithms that obscures the neurobiological mechanisms underlying cognition and impedes progress toward human-level artificial intelligence. Because of the strong relationship between cognition and working memory control, we suggest that the cognitive abilities of contemporary neural networks are limited by biologically-implausible working memory systems that rely on persistent activity maintenance and/or temporal nonlocality. Here we present NeuroLISP, an attractor neural network that can represent and execute programs written in the LISP programming language. Unlike previous approaches to high-level programming with neural networks, NeuroLISP features a temporally-local working memory based on itinerant attractor dynamics, top-down gating, and fast associative learning, and implements several high-level programming constructs such as compositional data structures, scoped variable binding, and the ability to manipulate and execute programmatic expressions in working memory (i.e., programs can be treated as data). Our computational experiments demonstrate the correctness of the NeuroLISP interpreter, and show that it can learn non-trivial programs that manipulate complex derived data structures (multiway trees), perform compositional string manipulation operations (PCFG SET task), and implement high-level symbolic AI algorithms (first-order unification). We conclude that NeuroLISP is an effective neurocognitive controller that can replace the symbolic components of hybrid models, and serves as a proof of concept for further development of high-level symbolic programming in neural networks.", "Pre-algebra mathematical competencies were assessed for a large and diverse sample of sixth graders (n = 1,926), including whole number and fractions arithmetic, conceptual understanding of equality and fractions magnitudes, and the fractions number line. The goal was to determine if there were clusters of students with similar patterns of pre-algebra strengths and weaknesses and if variation between clusters was related to mathematics attitudes, anxiety, or for a subsample (n = 342) some combination of intelligence, working memory, or spatial abilities. Critically, strengths and weaknesses were not uniform across the three identified clusters. Lower-performing students had pronounced deficits in their understanding of mathematical equality, fractions magnitudes, and the fractions number line. Higher-performing students had particular advantages in whole number and fractions arithmetic, and the fractions number line. Students could be reliably placed into clusters based on their mathematics self-efficacy and a combination of intelligence and spatial abilities. The results contribute to our understanding of key aspects of students' mathematical development, highlight areas in need of intervention for at-risk students, and identify cognitive areas in which scaffolds might be incorporated into these interventions.", "As the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) in health care increases, it will become increasingly crucial to involve health care professionals (HCPs) in developing, validating, and implementing AI-enabled technologies. However, because of a lack of AI literacy, most HCPs are not adequately prepared for this revolution. This is a significant barrier to adopting and implementing AI that will affect patients. In addition, the limited existing AI education programs face barriers to development and implementation at various levels of medical education.\nWith a view to informing future AI education programs for HCPs, this scoping review aims to provide an overview of the types of current or past AI education programs that pertains to the programs' curricular content, modes of delivery, critical implementation factors for education delivery, and outcomes used to assess the programs' effectiveness.\nAfter the creation of a search strategy and keyword searches, a 2-stage screening process was conducted by 2 independent reviewers to determine study eligibility. When consensus was not reached, the conflict was resolved by consulting a third reviewer. This process consisted of a title and abstract scan and a full-text review. The articles were included if they discussed an actual training program or educational intervention, or a potential training program or educational intervention and the desired content to be covered, focused on AI, and were designed or intended for HCPs (at any stage of their career).\nOf the 10,094 unique citations scanned, 41 (0.41%) studies relevant to our eligibility criteria were identified. Among the 41 included studies, 10 (24%) described 13 unique programs and 31 (76%) discussed recommended curricular content. The curricular content of the unique programs ranged from AI use, AI interpretation, and cultivating skills to explain results derived from AI algorithms. The curricular topics were categorized into three main domains: cognitive, psychomotor, and affective.\nThis review provides an overview of the current landscape of AI in medical education and highlights the skills and competencies required by HCPs to effectively use AI in enhancing the quality of care and optimizing patient outcomes. Future education efforts should focus on the development of regulatory strategies, a multidisciplinary approach to curriculum redesign, a competency-based curriculum, and patient-clinician interaction.", "We present an efficient utilization of a machine learning (ML) method concentrating on the 'AI for social good' application. We develop a digital dementia biomarker for early-onset dementia forecast. The paper demonstrates encouraging preliminary results of EEG-wearable-based signal analysis and a subsequent classification adopting a signal complexity test of a multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis (MFDFA) in emotional faces working memory training and evaluation tasks. For the digital biomarker of dementia onset detection, we examine shallow- and deep-learning machine learning models. We report the best median accuracies in a range of 90% for random forest and fully connected neural network classifier models in both emotional faces learning and evaluation experimental tasks. In addition, the classifiers are trained in a ten-fold cross-validation regime to discriminate normal versus mild cognitive impairment (MCI) cognition stages using MFDFA patterns from four-channel EEG recordings. Thirty-five volunteer elderly subjects participate in the current study concentrating on simple wearable EEG-based objective dementia biomarker progression. The reported outcomes showcase an essential social benefit of artificial intelligence (AI) employment for early dementia prediction. Furthermore, we improve ML employment for the succeeding application in an uncomplicated and applied EEG-wearable examination.", "The study of sulfur solubility is of great significance to the safe development of sulfur-containing gas reservoirs. However, due to measurement difficulties, experimental research data on sulfur solubility thus far are limited. Under the research background of small samples and poor information, a weighted least-squares support vector machine (WLSSVM)-based machine learning model suitable for a wide temperature and pressure range is proposed to improve the prediction accuracy of sulfur solubility in sour gas. First, we use the comprehensive gray relational analysis method to extract important factors affecting sulfur solubility as the model input parameters. Then, we use the whale optimization algorithm (WOA) and gray wolf optimizer (GWO) intelligence algorithms to find the optimal solution of the penalty factor and kernel coefficient and bring them into three common kernel functions. The optimal kernel function is calculated, and the final WOA-WLSSVM and GWO-WLSSVM models are established. Finally, four evaluation indicators and an outlier diagnostic method are introduced to test the proposed model's performance. The empirical results show that the WOA-WLSSVM model has better performance and reliability; the average absolute relative deviation is as low as 3.45%, determination coefficient (R 2) is as high as 0.9987, and the prediction accuracy is much higher than that of other models.", "Visual inspection of microscopic samples is still the gold standard diagnostic methodology for many global health diseases. Soil-transmitted helminth infection affects 1.5 billion people worldwide, and is the most prevalent disease among the Neglected Tropical Diseases. It is diagnosed by manual examination of stool samples by microscopy, which is a time-consuming task and requires trained personnel and high specialization. Artificial intelligence could automate this task making the diagnosis more accessible. Still, it needs a large amount of annotated training data coming from experts.In this work, we proposed the use of crowdsourced annotated medical images to train AI models (neural networks) for the detection of soil-transmitted helminthiasis in microscopy images from stool samples leveraging non-expert knowledge collected through playing a video game. We collected annotations made by both school-age children and adults, and we showed that, although the quality of crowdsourced annotations made by school-age children are sightly inferior than the ones made by adults, AI models trained on these crowdsourced annotations perform similarly (AUC of 0.928 and 0.939 respectively), and reach similar performance to the AI model trained on expert annotations (AUC of 0.932). We also showed the impact of the training sample size and continuous training on the performance of the AI models.In conclusion, the workflow proposed in this work combined collective and artificial intelligence for detecting soil-transmitted helminthiasis. Embedded within a digital health platform can be applied to any other medical image analysis task and contribute to reduce the burden of disease.", "scRNA-seq is on track for use as a routine measurement of clinical biochemistry and to assist in clinical decision-making and guide the performance of molecular medicine, but there are still a large number of challenges to be overcome. In conclusion, scRNA-seq-based clusters and differentiation of circulating blood cells have been examined and informative in patients with various diseases, although the information generated from scRNA-seq varies between different conditions, technologies, and diseases. Most of the clinical studies published have focused on the landscape of circulating immune cells, disease-specific patterns of new clusters, understanding of potential mechanisms, and potential correlation between cell clusters, differentiations, cell interactions, and circulating and migrated cells. It is clear that the information from scRNA-seq advances the understanding of the disease, identifies disease-specific target panels, and suggests new therapeutic strategies. The adaptation of scRNA-seq as a routine clinical measurement will require standardization and normalization of scRNA-seq-based comprehensive information and validation in a large population of healthy and diseased patients. The integration of public databases on human circulating cell clusters and differentiations with an application of artificial intelligence and computational science will accelerate the application of scRNA-seq for clinical practice. Thus, we call special attention from scientists and clinicians to the clinical and translational discovery, validation, and medicine opportunities of scRNA-seq development.", "Sensor ontologies formally model the core concepts in the sensor domain and their relationships, which facilitates the trusted communication and collaboration of Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT). However, due to the subjectivity of the ontology building process, sensor ontologies might be defined by different terms, leading to the problem of heterogeneity. In order to integrate the knowledge of two heterogeneous sensor ontologies, it is necessary to determine the correspondence between two heterogeneous concepts, which is the so-called ontology matching. Recently, more and more neural networks have been considered as an effective approach to address the ontology heterogeneity problem, but they require a large number of manually labelled training samples to train the network, which poses an open challenge. In order to improve the quality of the sensor ontology alignment, an unsupervised neural network model is proposed in this work. It first models the ontology matching problem as a binary classification problem, and then uses a competitive learning strategy to efficiently cluster the ontologies to be matched, which does not require the labelled training samples. The experiment utilizes the benchmark track provided by the Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative (OAEI) and multiple real sensor ontology alignment tasks to test our proposal's performance. The experimental results show that the proposed approach is able to determine higher quality alignment results compared to other matching strategies under different domain knowledge such as bibliographic and real sensor ontologies.", "A reliable assessment of bowel preparation is important to ensure high-quality colonoscopy. Current bowel preparation scoring systems are limited by interobserver variability. This study aimed to demonstrate objective assessment of bowel preparation adequacy using an artificial intelligence (AI)/convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm developed from colonoscopy videos.\nTwo CNNs were developed using a training set of 73,304 images from 200 colonoscopies. First, a binary CNN was developed and trained to distinguish video frames that were appropriate versus inappropriate for scoring with the Boston Bowel Preparation Scale (BBPS). A second multiclass CNN was developed and trained on 26,950 appropriate frames that were expertly annotated with BBPS segment scores (0-3). We validated the algorithm using 252 10-second video clips that were assigned BBPS segment scores by 2 experts. The algorithm provided mean BBPS scores based on the algorithm (AI-BBPS) by calculating mean BBPS based on each frame's scoring. We maximized the algorithm's performance by choosing a dichotomized AI-BBPS score that closely matched dichotomized BBPS scores (ie, adequate vs inadequate). We tested the mean BBPS score based on the algorithm AI-BBPS against human rating using 30 independent 10-second video clips (test set 1) and 10 full withdrawal colonoscopy videos (test set 2).\nIn the validation set, the algorithm demonstrated an area under the curve of .918 and accuracy of 85.3% for detection of inadequate bowel cleanliness. In test set 1, sensitivity for inadequate bowel preparation was 100% and agreement between raters and AI was 76.7% to 83.3%. In test set 2, sensitivity for inadequate bowel preparation for each segment was 100% and agreement between raters and AI was 68.9% to 89.7%. Agreement between raters alone versus raters and AI were similar (\u03ba\u00a0= .694 and .649, respectively).\nThe algorithm assessment of bowel cleanliness as measured with the BBPS showed good performance and agreement with experts including full withdrawal colonoscopies.", "Clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is common and associated with substantial mortality. TNM stage and histopathological grading have been the sole determinants of a patient's prognosis for decades and there are few prognostic biomarkers used in clinical routine. Management of ccRCC involves multiple disciplines such as urology, radiology, oncology, and pathology and each of these specialties generates highly complex medical data. Here, artificial intelligence (AI) could prove extremely powerful to extract meaningful information to benefit patients.\nIn the study, we developed and evaluated a multimodal deep learning model (MMDLM) for prognosis prediction in ccRCC.\nTwo mixed cohorts of non-metastatic and metastatic ccRCC patients were used: (1) The Cancer Genome Atlas cohort including 230 patients and (2) the Mainz cohort including 18 patients with ccRCC. For each of these patients, we trained the MMDLM on multiscale histopathological images, CT/MRI scans, and genomic data from whole exome sequencing.\nOutcome measurements included Harrell's concordance index (C-index) and also various performance parameters for predicting the 5-year survival status (5YSS). Different visualization techniques were used to make our model more transparent.\nThe MMDLM showed great performance in predicting the prognosis of ccRCC patients with a mean C-index of 0.7791 and a mean accuracy of 83.43%. Training on a combination of data from different sources yielded significantly better results compared to when only one source was used. Furthermore, the MMDLM's prediction was an independent prognostic factor outperforming other clinical parameters.\nMultimodal deep learning can contribute to prognosis prediction in ccRCC and potentially help to improve the clinical management of this disease.\nAn AI-based computer program can analyze various medical data (microscopic images, CT/MRI scans, and genomic data) simultaneously and thereby predict the survival time of patients with renal cancer.", "This article shows that current ethics guidance documents and initiatives for artificial intelligence (AI) tend to be dominated by a principled approach to ethics. Although this brings value to the field, it also entails some risks, especially in relation to the abstraction of this form of ethics that makes it poorly equipped to engage with and address deep socio-political issues and the material impacts of AI. This is particularly problematic considering the risk for AI to further entrench already existing social inequalities and injustices and contribute to environmental damage. To respond to this challenge posed by AI ethics today, this article proposes to complement the existing principled approach with an approach to ethics as attention to context and relations. It does so by drawing from alternative ethical theories to the dominant principled one, especially the ethics of care or other feminist approaches to ethics. Related to this, it encourages the inclusion of social sciences and humanities in the development, deployment and use of AI, as well as in AI ethics discussions and initiatives. This article presents this proposal for an ethics as attention to context and formulates a series of practical recommendations to implement this proposal concretely.", "Synthetic lethality (SL) is currently one of the most effective methods to identify new drugs for cancer treatment. It means that simultaneous inactivation target of two non-lethal genes will cause cell death, but loss of either will not. However, detecting SL pair is challenging due to the experimental costs. Artificial intelligence (AI) is a low-cost way to predict the potential SL relation between two genes. In this paper, a new Multi-Graph Ensemble (MGE) network structure combining graph neural network and existing knowledge about genes is proposed to predict SL pairs, which integrates the embedding of each feature with different neural networks to predict if a pair of genes have SL relation. It has a higher prediction performance compared with existing SL prediction methods. Also, with the integration of other biological knowledge, it has the potential of interpretability.", "Patient behavioral analysis is the key factor for providing treatment to patients who may suffer from various difficulties including neurological disease, head trauma, and mental disease. Analyzing the patient's behavior helps in determining the root cause of the disease. In traditional healthcare, patient behavioral analysis has lots of challenges that were much more difficult. The patient behavior can be easily analyzed with the development of smart healthcare. Information technology plays a key role in understanding the concept of smart healthcare. A new generation of information technologies including IoT and cloud computing is used for changing the traditional healthcare system in all ways. Using Internet of Things in the healthcare institution enhances the effectiveness as well as makes it more personalized and convenient to the patients. The first thing that will be discussed in the article is the technologies that have been used to support the smart class, and further, there will be a discussion on the existing problems with the smart healthcare system and how these problems can be solved. This study can provide essential information about the role of smart healthcare and IoT in maintaining behavior of patent. Various biomarkers are maintained properly with the help of these technologies. This study can provide effective information about importance of smart health system. This smart healthcare is conducted with the involvement of proper architecture. This is treated as effective energy efficiency architecture. Artificial intelligence is used increasingly in healthcare to maintain diagnosis and other important factors of healthcare. This application is also used to maintain patient engagement, which is also included in this study. Major hardware components are also included in this technology such as CO sensor and CO2 sensor.", "The basic aim of the study was to understand the role of the Big Five model of personality in predicting emotional intelligence and consequently in triggering the entrepreneurial behavior of the employees. The emotional intelligence of the individuals plays a very important role in decision making, enhancement of quality of living, and many other social realms. Hence, the intelligent use of emotions can make or break an individual's future considering their attitude toward exploiting the entrepreneurial opportunities available. This study has measured the impact of personality traits on emotional intelligence and EI's role in digital entrepreneurial behavior. The population used in this study was the middle management employees in the corporate sector of the mainland in China. The sample size taken in this study was 260 and selected through convenient sampling. The data was collected through a structured questionnaire measuring each variable. The data collected was employed to SmartPLS 3.3 for analyzing through structural equation modeling to measure the hypotheses. The study has found the partial effect of the Big Five model of personality on emotional intelligence, which significantly predicted the digital entrepreneurial behavior of the employees. The organizations can use the study findings to anticipate the employees' possible prospects and endeavors regarding their digital entrepreneurial behaviors.", "This paper investigates the effect of filtering (or modulating) the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) time-series on intelligence metrics predicted using dynamic functional connectivity (dFC). Thirteen brain regions that have highest correlation with intelligence are selected and their corresponding time-series are filtered. Using filtered time-series, the modified intelligence metrics are predicted. This experiment investigates whether modulating the time-series of one or two regions of the brain will increase or decrease the fluid ability and fluid intelligence among healthy humans. Two sets of experiments are performed. In the first case, each of the thirteen regions is separately filtered using four different digital filters with passbands: i) 0 - 0.25\u03c0, ii) 0.25\u03c0 - 0.5\u03c0, iii) 0.5\u03c0 - 0.75\u03c0, and iv) 0.75\u03c0 - \u03c0, respectively. In the second case, two of the thirteen regions are filtered simultaneously using a low-pass filter of passband 0 - 0.25\u03c0. In both cases, the predicted intelligence declined for 45-65% of the subjects after filtering in comparison with the ground truths. In the first case, the low-pass filtering process had the highest predicted intelligence among the four filters. In the second case, it was noticed that the filtering of two regions simultaneously resulted in a higher prediction of intelligence for over 80% of the subjects compared to low-pass filtering of a single region.", "Feature matching is a crucial component of computer vision that has various applications. With the emergence of Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD), the need for feature matching has also emerged in the medical imaging field. In this paper, we proposed a novel algorithm using the Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) [1] approach to achieve feature detection for ultrasound images based on the Deep Unfolding Super-resolution Network (USRNET). Based on the experimental results, our method shows higher interpretability and robustness than existing traditional feature extraction and matching algorithms. The proposed method provides a new insight for medical image processing, and may achieve better performance in the future with advancements of deep neural networks.", "Currently, there are no internationally accepted consensus guidelines for pathologic evaluation of posttherapy pancreatectomy specimens. The Neoadjuvant Therapy Working Group of Pancreatobiliary Pathology Society was formed in 2018 to review grossing protocols, literature, and major issues and to develop recommendations for pathologic evaluation of posttherapy pancreatectomy specimens. The working group generated the following recommendations: (1) Systematic and standardized grossing and sampling protocols should be adopted for pancreatectomy specimens for treated pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). (2) Consecutive mapping sections along the largest gross tumor dimension are recommended to validate tumor size by histology as required by the College of American Pathologists (CAP) cancer protocol. (3) Tumor size of treated PDACs should be measured microscopically as the largest dimension of tumor outer limits that is bound by viable tumor cells, including intervening stroma. (4) The MD Anderson grading system for tumor response has a better correlation with prognosis and better interobserver concordance among pathologists than does the CAP system. (5) A case should not be classified as a complete response unless the entire pancreas, peripancreatic tissues, ampulla of Vater, common bile duct, and duodenum adjacent to the pancreas are submitted for microscopic examination. (6) Future studies on tumor response of lymph node metastases, molecular and/or immunohistochemical markers, as well as application of artificial intelligence in grading tumor response of treated PDAC are needed. In summary, systematic, standardized pathologic evaluation, accurate tumor size measurement, and reproducible tumor response grading to neoadjuvant therapy are needed for optimal patient care. The criteria and discussions provided here may provide guidance towards these goals.", "The COVID-19 pandemic exposed a world surprisingly unprepared to respond to the new epidemiological scenario, even the developed countries, in spite of warnings from scientists since the 1990s. These alerts warned on the risks of an exponential increase in emergence of potentially pandemic zoonotic infectious diseases related to disruptive ecological niches in different regions of the globe, such as H1N1 Influenza, SARS, MERS, Zika, avian flu, swine flu, and Ebola, and also on the risks of a future and more lethal Disease X. We examine this global public health failure in anticipating and responding to the pandemic, stressing the urgent need for an innovative global pandemic preparedness system in the current transition from linear economy to a circular economy. Evidence provided here indicates that this novel preventive-based and resource-saving preparedness system could contribute to reverse the detrimental impacts of the pandemic on global economy and increase its resilience. Individual protection, contact tracing, and lockdown have proved to be just partially effective to respond to the spillover of viral zoonosis into the human population, and for most of these pathogens, vaccines are not yet available. As for COVID-19 vaccines, in spite of the extraordinary investments and unprecedented advances in innovative vaccines in few months, most of these products are expected to be available to more vulnerable developing countries' populations only by mid-2022. Furthermore, even when these vaccines are available, constraints such as low efficacy, waning immunity, new concerning COVID-19 variants, adverse events, and vaccine hesitancy might possibly restrict their public health impact and could contribute to aggravate the pandemic scenario. Considering these constraints and the severe global economic and social crises resulting from the lack of adequate preparedness and delayed effective response to COVID-19 and possibly to a future Disease X, we propose a pro-active global eco-social pandemic preparedness system. This novel system, based on One Health paradigm and on artificial intelligence and machine learning, is expected to incorporate \"spillover\" foresight and management into global preparedness and timely response. Designed to mitigate damage from outbreaks and minimize human morbidity and mortality, this approach to pandemic foresight and preparedness will be key to prevent a global disaster.", "Cancer research is increasing relying on data-driven methods and Artificial Intelligence (AI), to increase accuracy and efficiency in decision making. Such methods can solve a variety of clinically relevant problems in cancer diagnosis and treatment, provided that an adequate data availability is ensured. The generation of multicentric data repositories poses a series of integration and harmonization challenges. This work discusses the strategy, solutions and further issues identified along this procedure within the EU project INCISIVE that aims to generate an interoperable pan-European federated repository of medical images and an AI-based toolbox for medical imaging in cancer diagnosis and treatment.Clinical Relevance- Supporting the integration of medical imaging data and related clinical data into large interoperable repositories will enable the development, and validation, and wider adoption of AI-based methods in cancer diagnosis, prediction, treatment and follow-up.", "We aimed to investigate the change patterns in corneal sub-basal nerve morphology and corneal intrinsic aberrations in dry eye disease (DED). Our study included 229 eyes of 155 patients with DED and 40 eyes of 20 healthy control. We used the Oculus keratograph and the ocular surface disease index questionnaire to assess their signs and symptoms. In vivo confocal microscopy was used to observe the corneal sub-basal nerves, corneal endothelial cells, and Langerhans cells (LCs). An artificial intelligence (AI) technique run by the deep learning model generated the sub-basal nerve fibre parameters. Furthermore, we used the Pentacam HR system to measure the corneal intrinsic aberrations and corneal surface regularity indices. DED patients more frequently had increased anterior and total corneal aberrations than controls (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). In addition, DED had decreased average density and maximum length of corneal nerve. (Both P\u00a0<\u00a00.01) The LC number was significantly correlated with maximum length (CC\u00a0=\u00a0-0.19, P\u00a0=\u00a00.01) of the sub-basal nerve fibre. Furthermore, the corneal nerve average density was negatively correlated with IHD, and anterior, posterior, and total corneal aberrations (All P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) especially the higher-order aberrations. Significant correlations were seen between corneal nerve morphology changes, analysed by AI and corneal intrinsic aberrations, particularly higher-order aberrations.", "Modern conformal beam delivery techniques require image-guidance to ensure the prescribed dose to be delivered as planned. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have greatly augmented our ability to accurately localize the treatment target while sparing the normal tissues. In this paper, we review the applications of AI-based algorithms in image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT), and discuss the indications of these applications to the future of clinical practice of radiotherapy. The benefits, limitations and some important trends in research and development of the AI-based IGRT techniques are also discussed. AI-based IGRT techniques have the potential to monitor tumor motion, reduce treatment uncertainty and improve treatment precision. Particularly, these techniques also allow more healthy tissue to be spared while keeping tumor coverage the same or even better.", "Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) is a highly complex, costly procedure for patients with oncologic, hematologic, genetic, and immunologic diseases. Demographics and socioeconomic status as well as donor availability and type of health care system are important factors that influence access to and outcomes following allo-HCT. The last decade has seen an increase in the numbers of allo-HCTs and teams all over the world, with no signs of saturation. More than 80 000 procedures are being performed annually, with 1 million allo-HCTs estimated to take place by the end of 2024. Many factors have contributed to this, including increased numbers of eligible patients (older adults with or without comorbidities) and available donors (unrelated and haploidentical), improved supportive care, and decreased early and late post-HCT mortalities. This increase is also directly linked to macro- and microeconomic indicators that affect health care both regionally and globally. Despite this global increase in the number of allo-HCTs and transplant centers, there is an enormous need for increased access to and improved outcomes following allo-HCT in resource-constrained countries. The reduction of poverty, global economic changes, greater access to information, exchange of technologies, and use of artificial intelligence, mobile health, and telehealth are certainly creating unprecedented opportunities to establish collaborations and share experiences and thus increase patient access to allo-HCT. A specific research agenda to address issues of allo-HCT in resource-constrained settings is urgently warranted.", "The paper proposes accurate Blood Pressure Monitoring (BPM) based on a single-site Photoplethysmographic (PPG) sensor and provides an energy-efficient solution on edge cuffless wearable devices. Continuous PPG signal preprocessed and used as input of the Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and outputs systolic BP (SBP), diastolic BP (DBP), and mean arterial BP (MAP) values for each heartbeat. The improvement of the BPM accuracy is obtained by removing outliers in the preprocessing step and the whole-based inputs compared to parameter-based inputs extracted from the PPG signal. Performance obtained is 3.42 \u00b1 5.42 mmHg (MAE \u00b1 RMSD) for SBP, 1.92 \u00b1 3.29 mmHg for DBP, and 2.21 \u00b1 3.50 mmHg for MAP which is competitive compared to other studies. This is the first BPM solution with edge computing artificial intelligence as we have learned so far. Evaluation experiments on real hardware show that the solution takes 42.2 ms, 18.2 KB RAM, and 2.1 mJ average energy per reading.", "Critical care research in Canada is conducted primarily in academically-affiliated intensive care units with established research infrastructure, including research coordinators (RCs). Recently, efforts have been made to engage community hospital ICUs in research albeit with barriers. Automation or artificial intelligence (AI) could aid the performance of routine research tasks. It is unclear which research study processes might be improved through AI automation.\nWe conducted a cross-sectional survey of Canadian ICU research personnel. The survey contained items characterizing opinions regarding research processes that may be amenable to AI automation. We distributed the questionnaire via email distribution lists of 3 Canadian research societies. Open-ended questions were analyzed using a thematic content analysis approach.\nA total of 49 survey responses were received (response rate: 8%). Tasks that respondents felt were time-consuming/tedious/tiresome included: screening for potentially eligible patients (74%), inputting data into case report forms (65%), and preparing internal tracking logs (53%). Tasks that respondents felt could be performed by AI automation included: screening for eligible patients (59%), inputting data into case report forms (55%), preparing internal tracking logs (51%), and randomizing patients into studies (45%). Open-ended questions identified enthusiasm for AI automation to improve information accuracy and efficiency while freeing up RCs to perform tasks that require human interaction. This enthusiasm was tempered by the need for proper AI education and oversight.\nThere were balanced supportive (increased efficiency and re-allocation of tasks) and challenges (informational accuracy and oversight) with regards to AI automation in ICU research.", "Few countries systematically record and publish detailed information on the types, caliber, and makes of ammunition recovered by law enforcement. This results in a lack of knowledge of the ammunition used in crime, including in the European context. This pilot study examines the utility of ballistic datasets for monitoring illicit ammunition. The ballistic laboratories of four European countries-Denmark, Germany, Sweden, and Switzerland-provided access to non-confidential subsets of their national databases, including the caliber of recovered cartridge cases as well as the year and type of incident in which they were used. The laboratories also shared images of the ammunition headstamp markings, which helped determine each cartridge case's manufacturer and-when known-year of production. The resulting dataset covers 3130 cartridge cases documented by the participating laboratories between 2015 and the first quarter of 2020. Although limited in scope-the research team did not have access to geocoded data so spatial comparisons were limited to the country level-the dataset helps generate a baseline of the main varieties of ammunition used in crime, by country and crime category, and over time. Most of the ammunition (61 per cent) was recovered in the context of violent types of crime-homicides and assaults-for which pistol ammunition calibers were the most prominent. 610 unique headstamps were recorded, but only a small proportion of these varieties of ammunition accounted for most of the cases. All four country datasets included both foreign-made ammunition as well as cartridges produced domestically. The year of manufacture could be identified for 28 per cent of the cartridges, and at least 27 pieces of ammunition were produced in the same year that the criminal incident took place, which suggests recent diversion from licit holdings. The dataset revealed additional trends such as the criminal use of blank ammunition in all four case studies, as well as the relatively new prevalence of the 7,62\u00a0\u00d7\u00a039 caliber-which is typically used with AK-pattern rifles-in one country. In addition to shedding new light on the types of ammunition used in crime in the European context, monitoring illicit ammunition across space and over time has the potential to support police investigations with intelligence on criminals' sources of supply.", "The University Hospital Zurich together with IBM\u00ae invented an outcome prediction tool based on the IBM Watson technology, the Watson Trauma Pathway Explorer\u00ae. This tool is an artificial intelligence to predict three outcome scenarios in polytrauma patients: the Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) and sepsis within 21 days as well as death within 72 h. The knowledge of a patient's future under standardized trauma treatment might be of utmost importance. Here, new time-related insights on the C-reactive protein (CRP) and sepsis are presented. Meanwhile, the validated IBM Watson Trauma Pathway Explorer\u00ae offers a time-related insight into the most frequent laboratory parameters. In total, 3653 patients were included in the databank used by the application, and ongoing admissions are constantly implemented. The patients were grouped according to sepsis, and the CRP was analyzed according to the point of time at which the value was acquired (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, and 48 h and 3, 4, 5, 7, 10, 14, and 21 days). The differences were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney U-Test; binary logistic regression was used to determine the dependency of prediction, and the Closest Top-left Threshold Method presented time-specific thresholds at which CRP is predictive for sepsis. The data were considered as significant at p < 0.05, all analyses were performed in R. The differences in the CRP value of the non-sepsis and sepsis groups are starting to be significant between 6 and 8 h (p < 0.05) after admission inclusive of post hoc analysis, and the binary logistic regression depicts a similar picture. The level of significance is reached between 6 and 8 h (p < 0.05) after admission. The knowledge of the outcome reflected by the CRP in polytrauma patients improves the surgeon's tactical position to indicate operations to reduce antigenic load and avoid an infectious adverse outcome.", "Unobtrusive monitoring of driver mental states has been regarded as an important element in improving the safety of existing transportation systems. While many solutions exist relying on camera-based systems for e.g., drowsiness detection, these can be sensitive to varying lighting conditions and to driver facial accessories, such as eye/sunglasses. In this work, we evaluate the use of physiological signals derived from sensors embedded directly into the steering wheel. In particular, we are interested in monitoring driver stress levels. To achieve this goal, we first propose a modulation spectral signal representation to reliably extract electrocardiogram (ECG) signals from the steering wheel sensors, thus allowing for heart rate and heart rate variability features to be computed. When input to a simple logistic regression classifier, we show that up to 72% accuracy can be achieved when discriminating between stressful and non-stressful driving conditions. In particular, the proposed modulation spectral signal representation allows for direct quality assessment of the obtained heart rate information, thus can provide additional intelligence to autonomous driver monitoring systems.", "The possibility of low-dose positron emission tomography (PET) imaging using high sensitivity long axial field of view (FOV) PET/computed tomography (CT) scanners makes CT a critical radiation burden in clinical applications. Artificial intelligence has shown the potential to generate PET images from non-corrected PET images. Our aim in this work is to develop a CT-free correction for a long axial FOV PET scanner.\nWhole body PET images of 165 patients scanned with a digital regular FOV PET scanner (Biograph Vision 600 (Siemens Healthineers) in Shanghai and Bern) was included for the development and testing of the deep learning methods. Furthermore, the developed algorithm was tested on data of 7 patients scanned with a long axial FOV scanner (Biograph Vision Quadra, Siemens Healthineers). A 2D generative adversarial network (GAN) was developed featuring a residual dense block, which enables the model to fully exploit hierarchical features from all network layers. The normalized root mean squared error (NRMSE) and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), were calculated to evaluate the results generated by deep learning.\nThe preliminary results showed that, the developed deep learning method achieved an average NRMSE of 0.4\u00b10.3% and PSNR of 51.4\u00b16.4 for the test on Biograph Vision, and an average NRMSE of 0.5\u00b10.4% and PSNR of 47.9\u00b19.4 for the validation on Biograph Vision Quadra, after applied transfer learning.\nThe developed deep learning method shows the potential for CT-free AI-correction for a long axial FOV PET scanner. Work in progress includes clinical assessment of PET images by independent nuclear medicine physicians. Training and fine-tuning with more datasets will be performed to further consolidate the development.", "The development of the smart grid requires the distribution switch to not be limited to the original breaking function. More functional requirements lead to more complex switch structures, especially the intelligent processing unit on the secondary side. A technology called primary and secondary integration optimizes the structure of the switch, which greatly increases the intelligence level of the switch, but also has disadvantages. The secondary intelligent unit is arranged close to the primary high-voltage electromagnetic environment, and the distribution switch is prone to failure due to electromagnetic interference. In order to explore the influence of electromagnetic interference on it, a transient electromagnetic interference simulation test platform was built for a 10 kV intelligent distribution switch based on the principle of spherical gap arc discharge, and the interference signal of the intelligent distribution switch was measured; the law of the spatial magnetic field near the electronic transformer is mainly studied in this paper. The shielding effectiveness of the distribution terminal of the switch was analyzed, and the interference of the power line of the sensor merging unit circuit board was calculated. The results show that the electronic transformer may have serious faults under continuous strong transient electromagnetic interference. The electromagnetic transient simulation test system studied in this paper can evaluate the anti strong electromagnetic interference ability of the electronic transformer.", "Early detection of breast cancer is a powerful tool towards decreasing its socioeconomic burden. Although, artificial intelligence (AI) methods have shown remarkable results towards this goal, their \"black box\" nature hinders their wide adoption in clinical practice. To address the need for AI guided breast cancer diagnosis, interpretability methods can be utilized. In this study, we used AI methods, i.e., Random Forests (RF), Neural Networks (NN) and Ensembles of Neural Networks (ENN), towards this goal and explained and optimized their performance through interpretability techniques, such as the Global Surrogate (GS) method, the Individual Conditional Expectation (ICE) plots and the Shapley values (SV). The Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC) dataset of the open UCI repository was used for the training and evaluation of the AI algorithms. The best performance for breast cancer diagnosis was achieved by the proposed ENN (96.6% accuracy and 0.96 area under the ROC curve), and its predictions were explained by ICE plots, proving that its decisions were compliant with current medical knowledge and can be further utilized to gain new insights in the pathophysiological mechanisms of breast cancer. Feature selection based on features' importance according to the GS model improved the performance of the RF (leading the accuracy from 96.49% to 97.18% and the area under the ROC curve from 0.96 to 0.97) and feature selection based on features' importance according to SV improved the performance of the NN (leading the accuracy from 94.6% to 95.53% and the area under the ROC curve from 0.94 to 0.95). Compared to other approaches on the same dataset, our proposed models demonstrated state of the art performance while being interpretable.", "Emerging nonvolatile resistive switching, also known as the memristor, works with a distinct concept that relies mainly on the change in the composition of the active materials, rather than to store the charge. Particularly for oxide-based memristors, the switching is often governed by the random and unpredicted temporal/spatial migration of oxygen defects, resulting in possessing limitations in terms of control over conduction channel formation and inability to regulate hysteresis loop opening. Therefore, site specific dynamic control of defect concentration in the active materials can offer a unique opportunity to realize on-demand regulation of memory storage and artificial intelligence capabilities. Here, high-performance, site-specific spatially scalable memristor devices are fabricated by stabilizing the conduction channel via manipulation of oxygen defects using electron-beam irradiation. Specifically, the memristors exhibit highly stable and electron-beam dose-regulated multilevel analog hysteresis loop opening with adjustable switching ratios even higher than 104 . Additionally, broad modulation of neural activities, including short- and long-term plasticity, paired-pulse facilitation, spike-timing-dependent plasticity, and dynamic multipattern memory processing, are demonstrated. The work opens a new possibility to regulate the resistive switching behavior and control mimicking of neural activities, providing a hitherto unseen tunability in two-terminal oxide-based memristors.", "Developmental language disorder (DLD) often remains undetected until children shift from 'learning to read' to 'reading to learn,' around 9 years of age. Mono- and bilingual children with DLD frequently have co-occurring reading, attention, and related difficulties, compared to children with typical language development (TLD). Data for mono- and bilingual children with DLD and TLD would aid differentiation of language differences versus disorders in bilingual children.\nWe conducted a scoping review of descriptive research on mono-and bilingual children < and >= 9 years old with DLD versus TLD, and related skills (auditory processing, attention, cognition, executive function, and reading).\nWe searched PubMed for the terms \"bilingual\" and \"language disorders\" or \"impairment\" and \"child[ren]\" from August 1, 1979 through October 1, 2018.\nTwo abstracters charted all search results. Main exclusions were: secondary data/reviews, special populations, intervention studies, and case studies/series. Abstracted data included age, related skills measures', and four language groups of participants: monolingual DLD, monolingual TLD, bilingual DLD, and bilingual TLD.\nOf 366 articles, 159 (43%) met inclusion criteria. Relatively few (14%, n\u00a0=\u00a022) included all 4 language groups, co-occurring difficulties other than nonverbal intelligence (n\u00a0=\u00a049, 31%) or reading (n\u00a0=\u00a051, 32%) or any 9-18 year-olds (31%, n\u00a0=\u00a048). Just 5 (3%) included only 9-18 year-olds. Among studies with any 9 to 18 year olds, just 4 (8%, 4/48) included 4 language groups.\nFuture research should include mono- and bilingual children with both DLD and TLD, beyond 8 years of age, along with data about their related skills.", "Mucosa Associated Lymphoma Tissue (MALT) type is an extremely rare type of lymphoma which occurs in less than 3% of patients with primary Sj\u00f6gren's Syndrome (pSS). No reported studies so far have been able to investigate risk factors for MALT development across multiple cohort databases with sufficient statistical power. Here, we present a generalized, federated AI (artificial intelligence) strategy which enables the training of AI algorithms across multiple harmonized databases. A case study is conducted towards the development of MALT classification models across 17 databases on pSS. Advanced AI algorithms were developed, including federated Multinomial Na\u00efve Bayes (FMNB), federated gradient boosting trees (FGBT), FGBT with dropouts (FDART), and the federated Multilayer Perceptron (FMLP). The FDART with dropout rate 0.3 achieved the best performance with sensitivity 0.812, and specificity 0.829, yielding 8 biomarkers as prominent for MALT development.", "This work addresses the automatic segmentation of neonatal phonocardiogram (PCG) to be used in the artificial intelligence-assisted diagnosis of abnormal heart sounds. The proposed novel algorithm has a single free parameter - the maximum heart rate. The algorithm is compared with the baseline algorithm, which was developed for adult PCG segmentation. When evaluated on a large clinical dataset of neonatal PCG with a total duration of over 7h, an F1 score of 0.94 is achieved. The main features relevant for the segmentation of neonatal PCG are identified and discussed. The algorithm is able to increase the number of cardiac cycles by a factor of 5 compared to manual segmentation, potentially allowing to improve the performance of heart abnormality detection algorithms.", "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a disease that causes airflow limitation to the lungs and has a high morbidity around the world. The objective of this study was to evaluate how artificial intelligence (AI) is being applied for the management of the disease, analyzing the objectives that are raised, the algorithms that are used and what results they offer.\nWe conducted a scoping review following the Arksey and O'Malley (2005) and Levac et al. (2010) guidelines. Two reviewers independently searched, analyzed and extracted data from papers of five databases: Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, Cinahl and Cochrane. To be included, the studies had to apply some AI techniques for the management of at least one stage of the COPD clinical process. In the event of any discrepancy between both reviewers, the criterion of a third reviewer prevailed.\n380 papers were identified through database searches. After applying the exclusion criteria, 67 papers were included in the study. The studies were of a different nature and pursued a wide range of objectives, highlighting mainly those focused on the identification, classification and prevention of the disease. Neural nets, support vector machines and decision trees were the AI algorithms most commonly used. The mean and median values of all the performance metrics evaluated were between 80% and 90%.\nThe results obtained show a growing interest in the development of medical applications that manage the different phases of the COPD clinical process, especially predictive models. According to the performance shown, these models could be a useful complementary tool in the decision-making by health specialists, although more high-quality ML studies are needed to endorse the findings of this study.", "As a result of the decrease in socialization levels in computer-supported collaborative learning settings and/or interactions in social environments during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the adverse influence on the social intelligence development of nursing students could trigger loneliness.\nThe aim of this study was to evaluate the association of perceived sociability and social intelligence on loneliness in online learning among nursing students in Turkey.\nDescriptive, correlational and predictive study.\nA total of 246 nursing students in the Nursing Department of a state university in the Istanbul province of Turkey were included.\nData were collected using the Participant Information Form, Sociability Scale, UCLA Loneliness Scale-8 (ULS-8) for the Adolescents, and Tromso Social Intelligence Scale (TSIS) between November 2020 and December 2020. A multiple linear regression analysis was performed to identify predictors of loneliness. A p value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant.\nThe total mean Sociability Scale score was 23.54\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.51 (range: 10-46). The total mean TSIS score was 74.15\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09.98 (range: 46-105) and the total mean ULS-8 was 13.91\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.98 (range: 7-27). Perceived sociability in online learning (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-0.321, p\u00a0<\u00a0.001), and social intelligence (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-0.347, p\u00a0<\u00a0.001) were significant negative predictors (R2\u00a0=\u00a00.269, p\u00a0<\u00a0.001) of loneliness.\nPerceived sociability in online learning and social intelligence was associated with the level of loneliness of this population during online learning.", "Wide-ranging concerns exist regarding the use of black-box modelling methods in sensitive contexts such as healthcare. Despite performance gains and hype, uptake of artificial intelligence (AI) is hindered by these concerns. Explainable AI is thought to help alleviate these concerns. However, existing definitions for explainable are not forming a solid foundation for this work.\nWe critique recent reviews on the literature regarding: the agency of an AI within a team; mental models, especially as they apply to healthcare, and the practical aspects of their elicitation; and existing and current definitions of explainability, especially from the perspective of AI researchers. On the basis of this literature, we create a new definition of explainable, and supporting terms, providing definitions that can be objectively evaluated. Finally, we apply the new definition of explainable to three existing models, demonstrating how it can apply to previous research, and providing guidance for future research on the basis of this definition.\nExisting definitions of explanation are premised on global applicability and don't address the question 'understandable by whom?'. Eliciting mental models can be likened to creating explainable AI if one considers the AI as a member of a team. On this basis, we define explainability in terms of the context of the model, comprising the purpose, audience, and language of the model and explanation. As examples, this definition is applied to regression models, neural nets, and human mental models in operating-room teams.\nExisting definitions of explanation have limitations for ensuring that the concerns for practical applications are resolved. Defining explainability in terms of the context of their application forces evaluations to be aligned with the practical goals of the model. Further, it will allow researchers to explicitly distinguish between explanations for technical and lay audiences, allowing different evaluations to be applied to each.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies are increasingly used in pediatrics and have the potential to help inpatient physicians provide high-quality care for critically ill children.\nWe aimed to describe the use of AI to improve any health outcome(s) in neonatal and pediatric intensive care.\nPubMed, IEEE Xplore, Cochrane, and Web of Science databases.\nWe used peer-reviewed studies published between June 1, 2010, and May 31, 2020, in which researchers described (1) AI, (2) pediatrics, and (3) intensive care. Studies were included if researchers assessed AI use to improve at least 1 health outcome (eg, mortality).\nData extraction was conducted independently by 2 researchers. Articles were categorized by direct or indirect impact of AI, defined by the European Institute of Innovation and Technology Health joint report.\nOf the 287 publications screened, 32 met inclusion criteria. Approximately 22% (n = 7) of studies revealed a direct impact and improvement in health outcomes after AI implementation. Majority were in prototype testing, and few were deployed into an ICU setting. Among the remaining 78% (n = 25) AI models outperformed standard clinical modalities and may have indirectly influenced patient outcomes. Quantitative assessment of health outcomes using statistical measures, such as area under the receiver operating curve (56%; n = 18) and specificity (38%; n = 12), revealed marked heterogeneity in metrics and standardization.\nFew studies have revealed that AI has directly improved health outcomes for pediatric critical care patients. Further prospective, experimental studies are needed to assess AI's impact by using established implementation frameworks, standardized metrics, and validated outcome measures.", "Radiation therapy is a complex process involving multiple professionals and steps from simulation to treatment planning to delivery, and these procedures are prone to error. Additionally, the imaging and treatment delivery equipment in radiotherapy is highly complex and interconnected and represents another risk point in the quality of care. Numerous quality assurance tasks are carried out to ensure quality and to detect and prevent potential errors in the process of care. Recent developments in artificial intelligence provide potential tools to the radiation oncology community to improve the efficiency and performance of quality assurance efforts. Targets for artificial intelligence enhancement include the quality assurance of treatment plans, target and tissue structure delineation used in the plans, delivery of the plans and the radiotherapy delivery equipment itself. Here we review recent developments of artificial intelligence applications that aim to improve quality assurance processes in radiation therapy and discuss some of the challenges and limitations that require further development work to realise the potential of artificial intelligence for quality assurance.", "To explore the value of an artificial intelligence (AI)-based application for identifying plaque-specific stenosis and obstructive coronary artery disease from monoenergetic spectral reconstructions on coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA).\nThis retrospective study enrolled 71 consecutive patients (52 men, 19 women; 63.3 \u00b1 10.7 years) who underwent coronary CTA and invasive coronary angiography for diagnosing coronary artery disease. The conventional 120 kVp images and eight different virtual monoenergetic images (VMIs) (from 40 keV to 140 keV at increment of 10 keV) were reconstructed. An AI system automatically detected plaques from the conventional 120 kVp images and VMIs and calculated the degree of stenosis, which was further compared to invasive coronary angiography. The assessment was performed at a segment, vessel, and patient level.\nVessel and segment-based analyses showed comparable diagnostic performance between conventional CTA images and VMIs from 50 keV to 90 keV. For vessel-based analysis, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and diagnostic accuracy of conventional CTA were 74.3% (95% CI: 64.9%-82.0%), 85.6% (95% CI: 77.0%-91.4%), 84.3% (95% CI: 75.2%-90.7%), 76.1% (95% CI: 67.1%-83.3%) and 79.8% (95% CI: 73.7%-84.9%), respectively; the average sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and diagnostic accuracy values of the VMIs ranging from 50 keV to 90 keV were 71.6%, 90.7%, 87.5%, 64.1% and 81.6%, respectively. For plaque-based assessment, diagnostic performance of the average VMIs ranging from 50 keV to 100 keV showed no significant statistical difference in diagnostic accuracy compared to those of conventional CTA images in detecting calcified (91.4% vs. 93.8%, p > 0.05), noncalcified (92.6% vs. 85.2%, p > 0.05) or mixed (80.2% vs. 81.2%, p > 0.05) stenosis, although the specificity was slightly higher (53.4% vs. 40.0%, p > 0.05) in detecting stenosis caused by mixed plaques. For VMIs above 100 keV, the diagnostic accuracy dropped significantly.\nOur study showed that the performance of an AI-based application employed to detect significant coronary stenosis in virtual monoenergetic reconstructions ranging from 50 keV to 90 keV was comparable to conventional 120 kVp reconstructions.", "This study aimed to examine relationships and group differences among adult people's (aged 18-74) physical activity (PA), expression of stress, depression, emotional intelligence (EI), logical thinking (LT), and overall health assessment. Two hypotheses were formulated before the study. The first hypothesis is that overweight and obesity in young adults (18 to 34 years) females and males, in particular, should increase sharply and this should be associated with decreased PA, abruptly deteriorating subject health, increased stress, depression, and poorer emotion management and EI. Second hypothesis: We further thought that the better people's reflective thinking, the more they should live a healthier life (e.g., exercise more and eat healthier), their overweight and obesity should be small or none. We aimed to confirm or reject these two hypotheses. We applied a quantitative cross-sectional study design. The study results revealed that during the lifespan of 18-24 and 25-34 years (young adults) there was a sharp increase in overweight and obesity, a decrease in PA (and especially vigorous physical activity (VPA)) (and this was particularly evident in the male), while research participants felt less stress and depression, subjective assessment of health did not change, and EI increased steadily with age (18-24 to 65-74 years). The higher the EI of the research participants from 18-24 to 65-74 years of age the higher their moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), the less stress and depression they felt. Based on the results, it can be said that both females and males prefer PA \"with a hot heart rather than a cold mind.\" We base this conclusion on the fact that females and males who have the highest EI also have the highest MVPA while LT is not associated with MVPA.", "In order to study the observation of postoperative vital sign data of critically ill patients, this paper developed a set of vital sign data acquisition system based on intelligence and realized the design of vital sign data acquisition system APP based on Android Studio programming software, which was used to realize the information collection of vital sign data of patients. PDA is connected with a vital sign measuring equipment through Bluetooth. The patient's wristband is scanned with PDA to read the patient's information, and then the measured vital sign data are obtained automatically by measuring APP. The initial alarm value is set to be greater than 1%, and it needs more than 60 and less than or equal to 120 RR interval data to judge apnea. Information collection of intelligent vital sign detection can not only save the time of nursing staff but also improve the nursing quality.", "Education is central to the acquisition of knowledge, such as when children learn new concepts. It is unknown, however, whether educational differences impact not only what concepts children learn, but how those concepts come to be represented in semantic memory-a system that supports higher cognitive functions, such as creative thinking. Here we leverage computational network science tools to study hidden knowledge structures of 67 Swiss schoolchildren from two distinct educational backgrounds-Montessori and traditional, matched on socioeconomic factors and nonverbal intelligence-to examine how educational experience shape semantic memory and creative thinking. We find that children experiencing Montessori education show a more flexible semantic network structure (high connectivity/short paths between concepts, less modularity) alongside higher scores on creative thinking tests. The findings indicate that education impacts how children represent concepts in semantic memory and suggest that different educational experiences can affect higher cognitive functions, including creative thinking.", "The proposed MOLEM (Management of Lesion to Exclude Melanoma) schema is more clinically relevant than Melanocytic Pathology Assessment Tool and Hierarchy for Diagnosis (MATH-Dx) for the management classification of melanocytic and nonmelanocytic lesions excised to exclude melanoma. A more standardized way of establishing diagnostic criteria will be crucial in the training of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms.\nTo examine pathologists' variability, reliability, and confidence in reporting melanocytic and nonmelanocytic lesions excised to exclude melanoma using the MOLEM schema in a population of higher-risk patients.\nThis cohort study enrolled higher-risk patients referred to a primary care skin clinic in New South Wales, Australia, between April 2019 and December 2019. Baseline demographic characteristics including age, sex, and related clinical details (eg, history of melanoma) were collected. Patients with lesions suspicious for melanoma assessed by a primary care physician underwent clinical evaluation, dermoscopy imaging, and subsequent excision biopsy of the suspected lesion(s). A total of 217 lesions removed and prepared by conventional histologic method and stained with hematoxylin-eosin were reviewed by up to 9 independent pathologists for diagnosis using the MOLEM reporting schema. Pathologists evaluating for MOLEM schema were masked to the original histopathologic diagnosis.\nCharacteristics of the lesions were described and the concordance of cases per MOLEM class was assessed. Interrater agreement and the agreement between pathologists' ratings and the majority MOLEM diagnosis were calculated by Gwet AC1 with quadratic weighting applied. The diagnostic confidence of pathologists was then assessed.\nA total of 197 patients were included in the study (102 [51.8%] male; 95 [48.2%] female); mean (SD) age was 64.2 (15.8) years (range, 24-93 years). Overall, 217 index lesions were assessed with a total of 1516 histological diagnoses. Of 1516 diagnoses, 677 (44.7%) were classified as MOLEM class I; 120 (7.9%) as MOLEM class II; 564 (37.2%) as MOLEM class III; 114 (7.5%) as MOLEM class IV; and 55 (3.6%) as MOLEM class V. Concordance rates per MOLEM class were 88.6% (class I), 50.8% (class II), 76.2% (class III), 77.2% (class IV), and 74.2% (class V). The quadratic weighted interrater agreement was 91.3%, with a Gwet AC1 coefficient of 0.76 (95% CI, 0.72-0.81). The quadratic weighted agreement between pathologists' ratings and majority MOLEM was 94.7%, with a Gwet AC1 coefficient of 0.86 (95% CI, 0.84-0.88). The confidence in diagnosis data showed a relatively high level of confidence (between 1.0 and 1.5) when diagnosing classes I (mean [SD], 1.3 [0.3]), IV (1.3 [0.3]) and V (1.1 [0.1]); while classes II (1.8 [0.2]) and III (1.5 [0.4]) were diagnosed with a lower level of pathologist confidence (\u22651.5). The quadratic weighted interrater confidence rating agreement was 95.2%, with a Gwet AC1 coefficient of 0.92 (95% CI, 0.90-0.94) for the 1314 confidence ratings collected. The confidence agreement for each MOLEM class was 95.0% (class I), 93.5% (class II), 95.3% (class III), 96.5% (class IV), and 97.5% (class V).\nThe proposed MOLEM schema better reflects clinical practice than the MPATH-Dx schema in lesions excised to exclude melanoma by combining diagnoses with similar prognostic outcomes for melanocytic and nonmelanocytic lesions into standardized classification categories. Pathologists' level of confidence appeared to follow the MOLEM schema diagnostic concordance trend, ie, atypical naevi and melanoma in situ diagnoses were the least agreed upon and the most challenging for pathologists to confidently diagnose.", "Virtual surgery planning is a non-invasive procedure, which uses digital clinical data for diagnostic, procedure selection and treatment planning purposes, including the forecast of potential outcomes. The technique begins with 3D data acquisition, using various methods, which may or may not utilize ionizing radiation, such as 3D stereophotogrammetry, 3D cone-beam CT scans, etc. Regardless of the imaging technique selected, landmark selection, whether it is manual or automated, is the key to transforming clinical data into objects that can be interrogated in virtual space. As a prerequisite, the data require alignment and correspondence such that pre- and post-operative configurations can be compared in real and statistical shape space. In addition, these data permit predictive modeling, using either model-based, data-based or hybrid modeling. These approaches provide perspectives for the development of customized surgical procedures and medical devices with accuracy, precision and intelligence. Therefore, this review briefly summarizes the current state of virtual surgery planning.", "Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) is used to study inherent uncertainties using the Basic DRASTIC Framework (BDF) for assessing the groundwater vulnerability in a study area related to Lake Urmia. BMA is naturally an Inclusive Multiple Modelling (IMM) strategy at two levels; at Level 1 multiple models are constructed and the paper constructs three AI (Artificial Intelligence) models, which comprise ANN (Artificial Neural Network), GEP (Gene Expression Programming), and SVM (Support Vector Machines) but their outputs are fed to the next level model; at Level 2, BMA combines ANN, GEP and SVM (the Level 1 models) to quantify their inherent uncertainty in terms of within and in-between model errors. The model performance is tested by using the nitrate-N concentrations measured for the aquifer. The results show that in this particular study area, Level 1 models, even BDF, are quite accurate, but the above modelling strategy maximises the extracted information from the local data and BMA reveals that the higher uncertainties occur at areas with higher vulnerability; whereas lower uncertainties are observed at areas with lower vulnerabilities.", "Will Artificial Intelligence (AI) re-humanize or de-humanize medicine? As AI becomes pervasive in clinical medicine, we argue that the ethical framework that sustains a responsible implementation of such technologies should be reconsidered. The emergence of AI in the clinical setting will challenge our traditional moral boundaries surrounding discussions of patient care since it is unclear how the implementation of AI will promote and enhance the humanistic dimensions of medical practice. There are reasons for concern regarding 1) the anthropological implications of AI in the clinical context; 2) the method(s) and framework(s) used to address ethical issues in medicine; and 3) the impact of AI on clinical practice, particularly in the nature of clinical judgment. These three concerns are examined in hopes of providing pointers for subsequent and more in-depth discussions regarding clinical practice but the training of future health professionals.", "Surveys on explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) are related to biology, clinical trials, fintech management, medicine, neurorobotics, and psychology, among others. Prognostics and health management (PHM) is the discipline that links the studies of failure mechanisms to system lifecycle management. There is a need, which is still absent, to produce an analytical compilation of PHM-XAI works. In this paper, we use preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) to present a state of the art on XAI applied to PHM of industrial assets. This work provides an overview of the trend of XAI in PHM and answers the question of accuracy versus explainability, considering the extent of human involvement, explanation assessment, and uncertainty quantification in this topic. Research articles associated with the subject, since 2015 to 2021, were selected from five databases following the PRISMA methodology, several of them related to sensors. The data were extracted from selected articles and examined obtaining diverse findings that were synthesized as follows. First, while the discipline is still young, the analysis indicates a growing acceptance of XAI in PHM. Second, XAI offers dual advantages, where it is assimilated as a tool to execute PHM tasks and explain diagnostic and anomaly detection activities, implying a real need for XAI in PHM. Third, the review shows that PHM-XAI papers provide interesting results, suggesting that the PHM performance is unaffected by the XAI. Fourth, human role, evaluation metrics, and uncertainty management are areas requiring further attention by the PHM community. Adequate assessment metrics to cater to PHM needs are requested. Finally, most case studies featured in the considered articles are based on real industrial data, and some of them are related to sensors, showing that the available PHM-XAI blends solve real-world challenges, increasing the confidence in the artificial intelligence models' adoption in the industry.", "Different stakeholders may hold varying attitudes towards artificial intelligence (AI) applications in healthcare, which may constrain their acceptance if AI developers fail to take them into account. We set out to ascertain evidence of the attitudes of clinicians, consumers, managers, researchers, regulators and industry towards AI applications in healthcare.\nWe undertook an exploratory analysis of articles whose titles or abstracts contained the terms 'artificial intelligence' or 'AI' and 'medical' or 'healthcare' and 'attitudes', 'perceptions', 'opinions', 'views', 'expectations'. Using a snowballing strategy, we searched PubMed and Google Scholar for articles published 1 January 2010 through 31 May 2021. We selected articles relating to non-robotic clinician-facing AI applications used to support healthcare-related tasks or decision-making.\nAcross 27 studies, attitudes towards AI applications in healthcare, in general, were positive, more so for those with direct experience of AI, but provided certain safeguards were met. AI applications which automated data interpretation and synthesis were regarded more favourably by clinicians and consumers than those that directly influenced clinical decisions or potentially impacted clinician-patient relationships. Privacy breaches and personal liability for AI-related error worried clinicians, while loss of clinician oversight and inability to fully share in decision-making worried consumers. Both clinicians and consumers wanted AI-generated advice to be trustworthy, while industry groups emphasised AI benefits and wanted more data, funding and regulatory certainty.\nCertain expectations of AI applications were common to many stakeholder groups from which a set of dependencies can be defined.\nStakeholders differ in some but not all of their attitudes towards AI. Those developing and implementing applications should consider policies and processes that bridge attitudinal disconnects between different stakeholders.", "Recent scientific and technological advancements driven by the Internet of Things (IoT), Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), distributed computing and data communication technologies have opened up a vast range of opportunities in many scientific fields-spanning from fast, reliable and efficient data communication to large-scale cloud/edge computing and intelligent big data analytics. Technological innovations and developments in these areas have also enabled many opportunities in the space industry. The successful Mars landing of NASA's Perseverance rover on 18 February 2021 represents another giant leap for humankind in space exploration. Emerging research and developments of connectivity and computing technologies in IoT for space/non-terrestrial environments is expected to yield significant benefits in the near future. This survey paper presents a broad overview of the area and provides a look-ahead of the opportunities made possible by IoT and space-based technologies. We first survey the current developments of IoT and space industry, and identify key challenges and opportunities in these areas. We then review the state-of-the-art and discuss future opportunities for IoT developments, deployment and integration to support future endeavors in space exploration.", "The text similarity calculation plays a crucial role as the core work of artificial intelligence commercial applications such as traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) auxiliary diagnosis, intelligent question and answer, and prescription recommendation. However, TCM texts have problems such as short sentence expression, inaccurate word segmentation, strong semantic relevance, high feature dimension, and sparseness. This study comprehensively considers the temporal information of sentence context and proposes a TCM text similarity calculation model based on the bidirectional temporal Siamese network (BTSN). We used the enhanced representation through knowledge integration (ERNIE) pretrained language model to train character vectors instead of word vectors and solved the problem of inaccurate word segmentation in TCM. In the Siamese network, the traditional fully connected neural network was replaced by a deep bidirectional long short-term memory (BLSTM) to capture the contextual semantics of the current word information. The improved similarity BLSTM was used to map the sentence that is to be tested into two sets of low-dimensional numerical vectors. Then, we performed similarity calculation training. Experiments on the two datasets of financial and TCM show that the performance of the BTSN model in this study was better than that of other similarity calculation models. When the number of layers of the BLSTM reached 6 layers, the accuracy of the model was the highest. This verifies that the text similarity calculation model proposed in this study has high engineering value.", "With the depletion of surface resources, mining will develop toward the deep surface in the future, the objective conditions such as the mining environment will be more complex and dangerous than now, and the requirements for personnel and equipment will be higher and higher. The efficient mining of deep space is inseparable from movable and flexible production and transportation equipment such as scrapers. In the new era, intelligence is leading to the development trend of scraper (LHD), path tracking control is the key to the intelligent scraper (LHD), and it is also an urgent problem to be solved for unmanned driving. This paper describes the realization of the automatic operation of articulating the scraper (LHD) from two aspects, a mathematical model and trajectory tracking control method, and it focuses on the research of the path tracking control scheme in the field of unmanned driving, that is, an LQR controller. On this basis, combined with different intelligent clustering algorithms, the parameters of the LQR controller are optimized to find the optimal solution of the LQR controller. Then, the path tracking control of an intelligent LHD unmanned driving technology is studied, focusing on the optimization of linear quadratic optimal control (LQR) and the intelligent cluster algorithms AGA, QPSO, and ACA; this research has great significance for the development of the intelligent scraper (LHD). As mining engineers, we not only need to conduct research for practical engineering projects but also need to produce theoretical designs for advanced mining technology; therefore, the area of intelligent mining is the one we need to explore at present and in the future. Finally, this paper serves as a guide to starting a conversation, and it has implications for the development and the future of underground transportation.", "In the setting of kidney transplantation, histopathology of kidney biopsies is a key element in the organ assessment and allocation. Despite the broad diffusion of the Remuzzi-Karpinski score on preimplantation kidney biopsies, scientific evidence of its correlation to the transplantation outcome is controversial. The main issues affecting the prognostic value of histopathology are the referral to general on-call pathologists and the semiquantitative feature of the score, which can raise issues of interpretation. Digital pathology has shown very reliable and effective in the oncological diagnosis and treatment; however, the spread of such technologies is lagging behind in the field of transplantation. The aim of our study was to create a digital online platform where whole-slide images (WSI) of preimplantation kidney biopsies could be uploaded and stored.\nWe included 210 kidney biopsies collected between January 2015 and December 2019 from the joint collaboration of the transplantation centers of Padua and Verona. The selected slides, stained with hematoxylin and eosin, were digitized and uploaded on a shared web platform. For each case, the on-call pathologists' Remuzzi grades were obtained from the original report, together with the clinical data and the posttransplantation follow-up.\nThe storage of WSI of preimplantation kidney biopsies would have several clinical, scientific, and educational advantages. The clinical utility relies on the possibility to consult online expert pathologists and real-time quality checks of diagnosis. From the perspective of follow-up, the archived digitized biopsies can offer a useful comparison to posttransplantation biopsies. In addition, the digital online platform is a precious tool for multidisciplinary meetings aimed both at the clinical discussion and at the design of research projects. Furthermore, this archive of readily available WSI is an important educational resource for the training of professionals.\nFinally, the web platform lays the foundation for the introduction of artificial intelligence in the field of transplantation that would help create new diagnostic algorithms and tools with the final aim of increasing the precision of organ assessment and its predictive value for transplant outcome.", "To investigate the impacts of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) on white matter (WM) integrity and cognitive functions of pediatric patients with different levels of OSA severity.\nFifty-eight children with OSA and thirty-four healthy controls (HC) were recruited. All participants underwent diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) examination, polysomnography (PSG), and neurocognitive assessments. Patients were divided into mild OSA (MG) and moderate-severe OSA (SG) groups. WM integrity, PSG data, and neurocognitive assessment scores were compared among those groups.\nFor apnea hypopnea index (AHI), obstructive apnea hypopnea index (OAHI), arousal index, SpO2 nadir, and attention, SG was worse than both MG and HC with MG worse than HC. For baseline SpO2 and intelligence, SG was worse than both MG and HC with no significant difference between MG and HC. Impaired WM integrity was observed in bilateral anterior thalamic radiation, bilateral inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, bilateral inferior longitudinal fasciculus, right superior longitudinal fasciculus, right hippocampus, left cingulate gyrus, right uncinate fasciculus, callosum forceps major, and callosum forceps minor only for SG than for HC. WM integrity was significantly correlated with OSA severity and neurocognitive assessment scores only for SG, but not for MG.\nDecreased baseline SpO2, WM impairment, and intelligence decline were all observed only for SG, but not for MG, implying an associated relationship among decreased SpO2, WM impairment and WM impairment. Thus, for SG, additional assessments of brain damage and cognitive function decline are needed for prognostic evaluation of OSA.", "Acute lymphoblastic leukemia is the most common cancer in children, and its diagnosis mainly includes microscopic blood tests of the bone marrow. Therefore, there is a need for a correct classification of white blood cells. The approach developed in this article is based on an optimized and small IoT-friendly neural network architecture. The application of learning transfer in hybrid artificial intelligence systems is offered. The hybrid system consisted of a MobileNet v2 encoder pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset and machine learning algorithms performing the role of the head. These were the XGBoost, Random Forest, and Decision Tree algorithms. In this work, the average accuracy was over 90%, reaching 97.4%. This work proves that using hybrid artificial intelligence systems for tasks with a low computational complexity of the processing units demonstrates a high classification accuracy. The methods used in this study, confirmed by the promising results, can be an effective tool in diagnosing other blood diseases, facilitating the work of a network of medical institutions to carry out the correct treatment schedule.", "Several indicators are strongly related to health and well-being in university students, such as emotional intelligence and physical activity. At the same time, some qualities threaten it and are incompatible with students' adaptation to society in general, such as aggressive behaviours. The aim of this research is to analyse the relationship established between emotional intelligence using TMMS-24, physical activity, using IPAQ, and aggression behaviours in university students. For this purpose, a descriptive, cross-sectional and non-experimental study was developed with 932 undergraduates (M = 20.55; SD = 3.673). The findings highlight how emotional intelligence and physical activity practice decrease violent behaviour in university students. In addition, men tend to have more aggressive behaviours than women as well as the relation between physical activity and emotional intelligence is stronger in all its dimensions. Results highlight the importance of including emotional intelligence programs in order to enable undergraduate well-being.", "This study investigated the dynamic and long-term efficacy of vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) in patients with drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE) induced by tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). In addition, the impact of VNS on cognition and emotion after a one-year follow-up was evaluated.\nA total of 17 patients diagnosed with DRE induced by TSC were retrospectively recruited between 2008 and 2019. Dynamic changes in seizure frequency were observed in the responders (\u226550% reduction of seizure frequency at last follow-up) and non-responders. Clinical characteristics and seizure outcomes were comprehensively analyzed to determine factors associated with seizure outcomes. The Wechsler intelligence scale was applied in a subgroup of six pediatric patients, whereas the Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) and Self-rating Depression Scale (SDS) were assessed in a subgroup of nine patients to determine the impact of VNS therapy on cognitive performance and emotional state.\nThe follow-up duration for the 17 patients who underwent VNS treatment ranged from 0.5 to 10\u202fyears (mean\u202f\u00b1\u202fSD: 4.1\u202f\u00b1\u202f3.2\u202fyears). Monthly seizures decreased significantly from three months to four years post-treatment (p\u202f<\u202f0.05). At the last follow-up, 70.6% of the patients achieved at least a 50% reduction in seizure frequency, and three patients were completely seizure free. Comparatively, non-responder patients experienced deterioration of seizure frequency after the first year. Notably, after one-year follow-up the mean standard score of full-scale intelligence quotient increased from 67.33 to 69.5 (p\u202f=\u202f0.078) while the mean, standard score of SDS decreased from 49.22 to 45.67 (p\u202f=\u202f0.003) compared to preoperative neuropsychological evaluation results.\nVNS is a safe and effective treatment for patients with DRE caused by TSC. Although early outcomes were encouraging, a follow-up of at least one-year was required to predict long-term outcomes in patients receiving VNS treatment. Moreover, VNS may improve depressive mood in patients with DRE caused by TSC. Further investigations are needed to validate the present results.", "Current Internet of Things (IoT) stacks are frequently focused on handling an increasing volume of data that require a sophisticated interpretation through analytics to improve decision making and thus generate business value. In this paper, a cognitive IoT architecture based on FIWARE IoT principles is presented. The architecture incorporates a new cognitive component that enables the incorporation of intelligent services to the FIWARE framework, allowing to modernize IoT infrastructures with Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies. This allows to extend the effective life of the legacy system, using existing assets and reducing costs. Using the architecture, a cognitive service capable of predicting with high accuracy the vessel port arrival is developed and integrated in a legacy sea traffic management solution. The cognitive service uses automatic identification system (AIS) and maritime oceanographic data to predict time of arrival of ships. The validation has been carried out using the port of Valencia. The results indicate that the incorporation of AI into the legacy system allows to predict the arrival time with higher accuracy, thus improving the efficiency of port operations. Moreover, the architecture is generic, allowing an easy integration of the cognitive services in other domains.", "To evaluate the potential of artificial intelligence in combating COVID-19 pandemic.\nPubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library and Google Scholar were searched for the term \"Artificial intelligence and COVID-19\" up to March 31, 2021.\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is a potential tool to contain the current pandemic. AI can be used in many fields such as early detection and respective diagnosis, supervision of treatment, projection of cases and mortality, contact tracing of individuals, development of drugs and vaccines, reduces workload on health workers, prevention of disease, analysis of mental health of people amid pandemic.\nAI is being updated and being improved, second by second to be able to interpret like actual human minds. This advancement in AI may lead to a completely different future of COVID-19 pandemic where most of the simpler works may be done by AI and only essential works could be done by health workers in order to increase patient care in current scenario of COVID-19 outbreak. But again one of the main constraint is of limited trustworthy and noise free sources of information. So the need for the hour is to make a free data system where most of the analysed data could be available to feed AI, which could effectively halt the current pandemic.", "Globally, the confirmed coronavirus (SARS-CoV2) cases are being increasing day by day. Coronavirus (COVID-19) causes an acute infection in the respiratory tract that started spreading in late 2019. Huge datasets of SARS-CoV2 patients can be incorporated and analyzed by machine learning strategies for understanding the pattern of pathological spread and helps to analyze the accuracy and speed of novel therapeutic methodologies, also detect the susceptible people depends on their physiological and genetic aspects. To identify the possible cases faster and rapidly, we propose the Artificial Intelligence (AI) power screening solution for SARS- CoV2 infection that can be deployable through the mobile application. It collects the details of the travel history, symptoms, common signs, gender, age and diagnosis of the cough sound. To examine the sharpness of pathomorphological variations in respiratory tracts induced by SARS-CoV2, that compared to other respiratory illnesses to address this issue. To overcome the shortage of SARS-CoV2 datasets, we apply the transfer learning technique. Multipronged mediator for risk-averse Artificial Intelligence Architecture is induced for minimizing the false diagnosis of risk-stemming from the problem of complex dimensionality. This proposed application provides early detection and prior screening for SARS-CoV2 cases. Huge data points can be processed through AI framework that can examine the users and classify them into \"Probably COVID\", \"Probably not COVID\" and \"Result indeterminate\".", "MOFs exhibit inherent extraordinary features for diverse applications ranging from catalysis, storage, and optics to chemosensory and biomedical science and technology. Several procedures including solvothermal, hydrothermal, mechanochemical, electrochemical, and ultrasound techniques have been used to synthesize MOFs with tailored features. A continued attempt has also been directed towards functionalizing MOFs via \"post-synthetic modification\" mainly by changing linkers (by altering the type, length, functionality, and charge of the linkers) or node components within the MOF framework. Additionally, efforts are aimed towards manipulating the size and morphology of crystallite domains in the MOFs, which are aimed at enlarging their applications window. Today's knowledge of artificial intelligence and machine learning has opened new pathways to elaborate multiple nanoporous complex MOFs and nano-MOFs (NMOFs) for advanced theranostic, clinical, imaging, and diagnostic purposes. Successful accumulation of a photosensitizer in cancerous cells was a significant step in cancer therapy. The application of MOFs as advanced materials and systems for cancer therapy is the main scope beyond this perspective. Some challenging aspects and promising features in MOF-based cancer diagnosis and cancer therapy have also been discussed.", "Machine-intelligence platforms for the prediction of the probability of malignant transformation of oral potentially malignant disorders are required as adjunctive decision-making platforms in contemporary clinical practice. This study utilized time-to-event learning models to predict malignant transformation in oral leukoplakia and oral lichenoid lesions. A total of 1098 patients with oral white lesions from two institutions were included in this study. In all, 26 features available from electronic health records were used to train four learning algorithms-Cox-Time, DeepHit, DeepSurv, random survival forest (RSF)-and one standard statistical method-Cox proportional hazards model. Discriminatory performance, calibration of survival estimates, and model stability were assessed using a concordance index (c-index), integrated Brier score (IBS), and standard deviation of the averaged c-index and IBS following training cross-validation. This study found that DeepSurv (c-index: 0.95, IBS: 0.04) and RSF (c-index: 0.91, IBS: 0.03) were the two outperforming models based on discrimination and calibration following internal validation. However, DeepSurv was more stable than RSF upon cross-validation. External validation confirmed the utility of DeepSurv for discrimination (c-index-0.82 vs. 0.73) and RSF for individual survival estimates (0.18 vs. 0.03). We deployed the DeepSurv model to encourage incipient application in clinical practice. Overall, time-to-event models are successful in predicting the malignant transformation of oral leukoplakia and oral lichenoid lesions.", "Across species and ages, planning multi-step actions is a hallmark of intelligence and critical for survival. Traditionally, researchers adopt a \"top-down\" approach to action planning by focusing on the ability to create an internal representation of the world that guides the next step in a multi-step action. However, a top-down approach does not inform on underlying mechanisms, so researchers can only speculate about how and why improvements in planning occur. The current study takes a \"bottom-up\" approach by testing developmental changes in the real-time, moment-to-moment interplay among perceptual, neural, and motor components of action planning using simultaneous video, motion-tracking, head-mounted eye tracking, and electroencephalography (EEG). Preschoolers (n\u00a0= 32) and adults (n\u00a0= 22) grasped a hammer with their dominant hand to pound a peg when the hammer handle pointed in different directions. When the handle pointed toward their non-dominant hand, younger children (\"nonadaptive planners\") used a habitual overhand grip that interfered with wielding the hammer, whereas adults and older children (\"adaptive planners\") used an adaptive underhand grip. Adaptive and nonadaptive children differed in when and where they directed their gaze to obtain visual information, neural activation of the motor system before reaching, and straightness of\u00a0their reach trajectories. Nonadaptive children immediately used a habitual overhand grip before gathering visual information, leaving insufficient time to form a plan before acting. Our novel bottom-up approach transcends mere speculation by providing converging evidence that the development of action planning depends on a real-time \"tug of war\" between habits and information gathering and processing.", "Drug repositioning aims to reuse existing drugs, shelved drugs, or drug candidates that failed clinical trials for other medical indications. Its attraction is sprung from the reduction in risk associated with safety testing of new medications and the time to get a known drug into the clinics. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been recently pursued to speed up drug repositioning and discovery. The essence of AI in drug repositioning is to unify the knowledge and actions, i.e. incorporating real-world and experimental data to map out the best way forward to identify effective therapeutics against a disease. In this review, we share positive expectations for the evolution of AI and drug repositioning and summarize the role of AI in several methods of drug repositioning.", "Multiple myeloma can affect the complete skeleton, which makes whole-body imaging necessary.

Material and Methods: This study retrospectively enrolled patients at the Keelung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital from November of 2016 to June, 2017, who were diagnosed with gastric adenocarcinoma. The inclusion criteria were patients' pathologic reports that revealed all compartments of Helicobacter pylori infection, gastritis, IM, and adenocarcinoma simultaneously in the same gastric sample. Tissue slides after immunohistochemical (IHC) staining were transformed into digital images using a scanner and counted using computer software (QuPath and ImageJ). IHC staining included PA1-711 antibody for VDR, Ki67 antigen for proliferation, and M30 antibody CK18 for apoptosis. Results: Twenty-nine patients were included in the IHC staining quantitative analysis. The mean age was 69.1 \u00b1 11.3 y/o. Most (25/29, 86.2%) patients had poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. The mean expression of Ki67 and CK18 increased progressively from gastritis and IM to adenocarcinoma, with statistical significance (P < 0.05). VDR expression did not correlate with Ki67 or CK18 expression. Survival time was only correlated with tumor stage (correlation coefficient = -0.423, P value < 0.05), but was not correlated with the expression of VDR, Ki67, and CK18. Conclusion: Ki67 expression and CK18 expression progressively increased in the areas of gastritis, IM, and adenocarcinoma. No correlation between VDR expression and Ki67 or CK18 expression was found in this study.", "The Internet of Things (IoT) allows the sharing of information among devices in a network. Hardware evolutions have enabled the employment of cognitive agents on top of such devices, which could help to adopt pro-active and autonomous IoT systems. Agents are autonomous entities from Artificial Intelligence capable of sensing (perceiving) the environment where they are situated. Then, with these captured perceptions, they can reason and act pro-actively. However, some agent approaches are created for a specific domain or application when dealing with embedded systems and hardware interfacing. In addition, the agent architecture can compromise the system's performance because of the number of perceptions that agents can access. This paper presents three engineering approaches for creating IoT Objects using Embedded Multi-agent systems (MAS)-as cognitive systems at the edge of an IoT network-connecting, acting, and sharing information with a re-engineered IoT architecture based on the Sensor as a Service model. These engineering approaches use Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) agents and the JaCaMo framework. In addition, it is expected to diversify the designers' choice in applying embedded MAS in IoT systems. We also present a case study to validate the whole re-engineered architecture and the approaches. Moreover, some performance tests and comparisons are also presented. The study case shows that each approach is more or less suitable depending on the domain tackled. The performance tests show that the re-engineered IoT architecture is scalable and that there are some trade-offs in adopting one or another approach. The contributions of this paper are an architecture for sharing resources in an IoT network, the use of embedded MAS on top IoT Objects, and three engineering approaches considering agent and artifacts dimensions.", "The ubiquity of social media and their deep integration in the contemporary society has granted new ways to interact, exchange information, form groups, or earn money-all on a scale never seen before. Those possibilities paired with the widespread popularity contribute to the level of impact that social media display. Unfortunately, the benefits brought by them come at a cost. Social Media can be employed by various entities to spread disinformation-so called 'Fake News', either to make a profit or influence the behaviour of the society. To reduce the impact and spread of Fake News, a diverse array of countermeasures were devised. These include linguistic-based approaches, which often utilise Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Deep Learning (DL). However, as the latest advancements in the Artificial Intelligence (AI) domain show, the model's high performance is no longer enough. The explainability of the system's decision is equally crucial in real-life scenarios. Therefore, the objective of this paper is to present a novel explainability approach in BERT-based fake news detectors. This approach does not require extensive changes to the system and can be attached as an extension for operating detectors. For this purposes, two Explainable Artificial Intelligence (xAI) techniques, Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) and Anchors, will be used and evaluated on fake news data, i.e., short pieces of text forming tweets or headlines. This focus of this paper is on the explainability approach for fake news detectors, as the detectors themselves were part of previous works of the authors.", "Meat eating is one of the hallmarks of human evolution. It has been linked to the beginning of stone tool use, to physiological changes leading to crucial anatomical transformations defining our genus, and to new socioreproductive and cognitive behaviors. Uncontroversial evidence of meat eating goes back to 2.6 million years ago; however, little is known about the frequency and timing with which early hominins acquired animal resources. Here, we show that the combination of hunting and scavenging documented in some modern human foragers may have a long evolutionary trajectory. Using a new set of artificial intelligence methods for objective identification, we present direct evidence of an episode of hominins scavenging from large felids-probably lions-discovered at Olduvai Gorge (DS site, Bed I). This casts a new perspective on the diversity of hominin carcass acquisition behaviors and survival strategies, and places some early Pleistocene hominins in ecological proximity to African large carnivore guilds.", "The concept of healing in medicine has been taking a new form where scientists and researchers are in pursuance of regenerative medicine. Until now, doctors have \"reacted\" to disease by treating the symptoms; however, modern medicine is transforming toward regeneration rather than reactive treatment, which is where stem cell therapy comes into the play-the concept of replacing damaged cells with brand new cells that perform the same function better. Stem cell treatment is currently being used to treat autoimmune, inflammatory, neurological, orthopedic, and traumatic disorders, with various research being undertaken for a wide range of diseases. It could also be the answer to anti-aging and a disease-free state. Despite the benefits, numerous errors could prevail in treating patients with stem cells.\u00a0With the advancement of technology and research in the modern period, medicine is beginning to turn to artificial intelligence (AI) to address the complicated errors that could occur in regenerative medicine. For successful treatment, one must achieve precision and accuracy when analyzing healthy and productive stem cells that possess all the properties of a native cell. This review intends to discuss and study the application of AI\u00a0in stem cell therapy and how it influences how medicine is practiced, thus creating a path to a regenerative future with negligible adverse effects. The following databases were used for a literature search: PubMed, Google Scholar, PubMed Central, and Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Xplore. After a thorough analysis, studies were chosen, keeping in mind the inclusion and exclusion criteria set by the authors of this review, which comprised reports published within the last six years in the English language. The authors also made sure to include studies that sufficed the quality of each report assessed using appropriate quality appraisal tools, after which eight reports were found to be eligible and were included in this review. This research mainly revolves around machine learning, deep neural networks (DNN), and other subclasses of AI encompassed in these categories. While there are concerns and limitations in implementing various mediums of AI in stem cell therapy, the analysis of the eligible studies concluded that artificial intelligence provides significant benefits to the global healthcare ecosystem in numerous ways, such as determining the viability, functionality, biosafety, and bioefficacy of stem cells, as well as appropriate patient selection. Applying AI to this novelty brings out the precision, accuracy, and a revolution in regenerative medicine. In addition, stem cell therapy is not currently FDA approved (except for the blood-forming stem cells) and, to date, is considered experimental with no clear outline of risks and benefits. Given this limitation, studies are conducted regularly around the world in hopes for a concrete conclusion where technological advances such as AI could help in shaping the future of regenerative medicine.", "The primary care physician's traditional patient contacts are challenged by the rapidly accelerating digital transformation. In a quantitative survey analysis based on the theory of planned behavior, we found high behavioral intention to use telemedicine among Swedish primary care physicians, but low reported use. The aim of this study was to further examine the physicians' experiences regarding telemedicine, with a focus on possible explanations for the gap between intention and use, through analysis of the free-text comments supplied in the survey.\nThe material was collected through a web-based survey which was sent out to physicians at 160 primary health care centers in southern Sweden from May to August 2019. The survey covered four areas: general experiences of telemedicine, digital contacts, chronic disease monitoring with digital tools, and artificial intelligence. A total of 100 physicians submitted one or more free-text comments. These were analyzed using qualitative content analysis with an inductive approach.\nThe primary care physicians expressed attitudes towards telemedicine that focused on clinical usefulness. Barriers to use were the loss of personal contact with patients and a deficient technological infrastructure. The major concerns were that these factors would result in patient harm and an increased workload. The connection between intention and use postulated by the theory of planned behavior was not applicable in this context, as external factors in the form of availability and clinical usefulness of the specific technology were major impediments to use despite a generally positive attitude.\nAll telemedicine tools must be evaluated regarding clinical usefulness, patient safety, and effects on staff workload, and end users should be included in this process. Utmost consideration is needed regarding how to retain the benefits of personal contact between patient and provider when digital solutions are introduced.", "Use of prostate MRI has increased greatly in the past decade, primarily in directing targeted prostate biopsy. However, prostate MRI interpretation remains prone to interreader variation. Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to standardize detection of lesions on MRI that are suspicious for prostate cancer (PCa). The purpose of this review is to explore the current status of AI for the automated detection of PCa on MRI. Recent literature describing promising results regarding AI models for PCa detection on MRI is highlighted. Numerous limitations of the existing literature are also described, including biases in model validation, heterogeneity in reporting of performance metrics, and lack of sufficient evidence of clinical translation. Challenges related to AI ethics and data governance are also discussed. An outlook is provided for AI in lesion detection on prostate MRI in the coming years, emphasizing current research needs. Future investigations, incorporating large-scale diverse multiinstitutional training and testing datasets, are anticipated to enable the development of more robust AI models for PCa detection on MRI, though prospective clinical trials will ultimately be required to establish benefit of AI in patient management.", "The aim of this work was to explore the effects of Gamma nail internal fixation for intertrochanteric fracture of femur by X-ray film classification and recognition method based on artificial intelligence algorithm. The study subjects were 100 elderly patients with intertrochanteric fracture of femur admitted to hospital. The cases were diagnosed as elderly (over 60 years old) femoral intertrochanteric fractures by X-ray or CT. They were divided into two groups, with 50 persons in each group: one group used the X-ray film evaluation image guidance based on the artificial intelligence algorithm (research group), and the other group did not use algorithmic guidance (control group). The results showed that the segmentation effect of the proposed algorithm was similar to the gold standard segmentation result, indicating that the algorithm was effective and feasible in the segmentation of fractures and bones. The global level set algorithm was set as the control. The ultimate measurement accuracy (UMA) value of the algorithm group was (1.77 \u00b1 0.22), and the UMA value of the global level set algorithm group was (3.42 \u00b1 0.36), indicating that the image processed by the algorithm group had obvious numerical effect, high accuracy, and good retention of details. The operation time, intraoperative blood loss, incision length, hospital stay, weight-bearing time, and fracture healing time of the two groups were all better than those of the control group. One month after surgery, the Harris score of the algorithm group was 67, and that of the control group was 51, with a 16-point difference between the two groups (p < 0.05). The patient had less pain and fast recovery speed, indicating that it was a good way to treat elderly intertrochanteric fractures with the nursing effect of X-ray Gamma nail internal fixation based on an artificial intelligence algorithm. The artificial intelligence algorithm not only can be applied to the Gamma nail internal fixation of elderly patients with intertrochanteric fractures but also can be applied to the X-ray image processing of other fractures and other surgical methods to provide effective treatment for fracture patients.", "The inferior alveolar nerve (IAN) innervates and regulates the sensation of the mandibular teeth and lower lip. The position of the IAN should be monitored prior to surgery. Therefore, a study using artificial intelligence (AI) was planned to image and track the position of the IAN automatically for a quicker and safer surgery.\nA total of 138 cone-beam computed tomography datasets (Internal: 98, External: 40) collected from multiple centers (three hospitals) were used in the study. A customized 3D nnU-Net was used for image segmentation. Active learning, which consists of three steps, was carried out in iterations for 83 datasets with cumulative additions after each step. Subsequently, the accuracy of the model for IAN segmentation was evaluated using the 50 datasets. The accuracy by deriving the dice similarity coefficient (DSC) value and the segmentation time for each learning step were compared. In addition, visual scoring was considered to comparatively evaluate the manual and automatic segmentation.\nAfter learning, the DSC gradually increased to 0.48\u2009\u00b1\u20090.11 to 0.50\u2009\u00b1\u20090.11, and 0.58\u2009\u00b1\u20090.08. The DSC for the external dataset was 0.49\u2009\u00b1\u20090.12. The times required for segmentation were 124.8, 143.4, and 86.4\u00a0s, showing a large decrease at the final stage. In visual scoring, the accuracy of manual segmentation was found to be higher than that of automatic segmentation.\nThe deep active learning framework can serve as a fast, accurate, and robust clinical tool for demarcating IAN location.", "Policies shape society. Public health policies are of particular importance, as they often dictate matters in life and death. Accumulating evidence indicates that good-intentioned COVID-19 policies, such as shelter-in-place measures, can often result in unintended consequences among vulnerable populations such as nursing home residents and domestic violence victims. Thus, to shed light on the issue, this study aimed to identify policy-making processes that have the potential of developing policies that could induce optimal desirable outcomes with limited to no unintended consequences amid the pandemic and beyond. Methods: A literature review was conducted in PubMed, PsycINFO, and Scopus to answer the research question. To better structure the review and the subsequent analysis, theoretical frameworks such as the social ecological model were adopted to guide the process. Results: The findings suggested that: (1) people-centered; (2) artificial intelligence (AI)-powered; (3) data-driven, and (4) supervision-enhanced policy-making processes could help society develop policies that have the potential to yield desirable outcomes with limited unintended consequences. To leverage these strategies' interconnectedness, the people-centered, AI-powered, data-driven, and supervision-enhanced (PADS) model of policy making was subsequently developed. Conclusions: The PADS model can develop policies that have the potential to induce optimal outcomes and limit or eliminate unintended consequences amid COVID-19 and beyond. Rather than serving as a definitive answer to problematic COVID-19 policy-making practices, the PADS model could be best understood as one of many promising frameworks that could bring the pandemic policy-making process more in line with the interests of societies at large; in other words, more cost-effectively, and consistently anti-COVID and pro-human.", "Validity evaluation is fundamental in neuropsychological assessment in adults, with increasing interest among pediatric neuropsychologists. Although some measures exist, given time constraints placed on clinicians, and children's limited sustained attention, development of less time-consuming measures is beneficial. We explored the use of the Temporal Memory Sequence Test (TMST), a new performance validity test, in clinically referred children. One minor adaptation included reading the instructions and labels to non-fluent readers. Participants were 68 consecutive clinically referred children and adolescents, aged 6-18\u2009years, with neurological (n\u2009=\u200946) or behavioral (n\u2009=\u200922) difficulties. Applying the adult cutoff, 83.8% passed the TMST. Age, gender, and diagnosis did not differ between children passing the TMST cutoff and those who failed it. Classification accuracy calculated against three embedded measures of performance validity (Wechsler scale Digit Span, Coding, and Processing Speed Index) indicated specificity over 90% (Digit Span: 94%, Coding: 96%, Processing Speed Index: 92%) and sensitivity between 30 and 33%. For individuals without Intellectual Disability (ID), 90.9% passed the TMST, and intelligence did not predict success. Thus, the use of the TMST with the adult cutoff was supported in children without ID, offering an additional validity measure for clinically referred children.", "Machine learning (ML), one aspect of artificial intelligence (AI), involves computer algorithms that train themselves. They have been widely applied in the healthcare domain. However, many trained ML algorithms operate as 'black boxes', producing a prediction from input data without a clear explanation of their workings. Non-transparent predictions are of limited utility in many clinical domains, where decisions must be justifiable. Here, we apply class-contrastive counterfactual reasoning to ML to demonstrate how specific changes in inputs lead to different predictions of mortality in people with severe mental illness (SMI), a major public health challenge. We produce predictions accompanied by visual and textual explanations as to how the prediction would have differed given specific changes to the input. We apply it to routinely collected data from a mental health secondary care provider in patients with schizophrenia. Using a data structuring framework informed by clinical knowledge, we captured information on physical health, mental health, and social predisposing factors. We then trained an ML algorithm and other statistical learning techniques to predict the risk of death. The ML algorithm predicted mortality with an area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.80 (95% confidence intervals [0.78, 0.82]). We used class-contrastive analysis to produce explanations for the model predictions. We outline the scenarios in which class-contrastive analysis is likely to be successful in producing explanations for model predictions. Our aim is not to advocate for a particular model but show an application of the class-contrastive analysis technique to electronic healthcare record data for a disease of public health significance. In patients with schizophrenia, our work suggests that use or prescription of medications like antidepressants was associated with lower risk of death. Abuse of alcohol/drugs and a diagnosis of delirium were associated with higher risk of death. Our ML models highlight the role of co-morbidities in determining mortality in patients with schizophrenia and the need to manage co-morbidities in these patients. We hope that some of these bio-social factors can be targeted therapeutically by either patient-level or service-level interventions. Our approach combines clinical knowledge, health data, and statistical learning, to make predictions interpretable to clinicians using class-contrastive reasoning. This is a step towards interpretable AI in the management of patients with schizophrenia and potentially other diseases.", "The rapid market expansion of Li-ion batteries (LIBs) leads to concerns over the appropriate disposal of hazardous battery waste and the sustainability in the supply of critical materials for LIB production. Technologies and strategies to extend the life of LIBs and reuse the materials have long been sought. Direct recycling is a more effective recycling approach than existing ones with respect to cost, energy consumption, and emissions. This approach has become increasingly more feasible due to digitalization and the adoption of the Internet-of-Things (IoT). To address the question of how IoT could enhance direct recycling of LIBs, we first highlight the importance of direct recycling in tackling the challenges in the supply chain of LIB and discuss the characteristics and application of IoT technologies, which could enhance direct recycling. Finally, we share our perspective on a paradigm where IoT could be integrated into the direct recycling process of LIBs to enhance the efficiency, intelligence, and effectiveness of the recycling process.", "Digital pathology is gaining prominence among the researchers with developments in advanced imaging modalities and new technologies. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are a recent development in the field of artificial intelligence and since their inception, have boosted considerable interest in digital pathology. GANs and their extensions have opened several ways to tackle many challenging histopathological image processing problems such as color normalization, virtual staining, ink removal, image enhancement, automatic feature extraction, segmentation of nuclei, domain adaptation and data augmentation. This paper reviews recent advances in histopathological image processing using GANs with special emphasis on the future perspectives related to the use of such a technique. The papers included in this review were retrieved by conducting a keyword search on Google Scholar and manually selecting the papers on the subject of H&E stained digital pathology images for histopathological image processing. In the first part, we describe recent literature that use GANs in various image preprocessing tasks such as stain normalization, virtual staining, image enhancement, ink removal, and data augmentation. In the second part, we describe literature that use GANs for image analysis, such as nuclei detection, segmentation, and feature extraction. This review illustrates the role of GANs in digital pathology with the objective to trigger new research on the application of generative models in future research in digital pathology informatics.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) is a new technical discipline that uses computer technology to research and develop the theory, method, technique, and application system for the simulation, extension, and expansion of human intelligence. With the assistance of new AI technology, the traditional medical environment has changed a lot. For example, a patient's diagnosis based on radiological, pathological, endoscopic, ultrasonographic, and biochemical examinations has been effectively promoted with a higher accuracy and a lower human workload. The medical treatments during the perioperative period, including the preoperative preparation, surgical period, and postoperative recovery period, have been significantly enhanced with better surgical effects. In addition, AI technology has also played a crucial role in medical drug production, medical management, and medical education, taking them into a new direction. The purpose of this review is to introduce the application of AI in medicine and to provide an outlook of future trends.", "This article uses a multimodal smart music online teaching method combined with artificial intelligence to address the problem of smart music online teaching and to compensate for the shortcomings of the single modal classification method that only uses audio features for smart music online teaching. The selection of music intelligence models and classification models, as well as the analysis and processing of music characteristics, is the subjects of this article. It mainly studies how to use lyrics and how to combine audio and lyrics to intelligently classify music and teach multimodal and monomodal smart music online. In the online teaching of smart music based on lyrics, on the basis of the traditional wireless network node feature selection method, three parameters of frequency, concentration, and dispersion are introduced to adjust the statistical value of wireless network nodes, and an improved wireless network is proposed. After feature selection, the TFIDF method is used to calculate the weights, and then artificial intelligence is used to perform secondary dimensionality reduction on the lyrics. Experimental data shows that in the process of intelligently classifying lyrics, the accuracy of the traditional wireless network node feature selection method is 58.20%, and the accuracy of the improved wireless network node feature selection method is 67.21%, combined with artificial intelligence and improved wireless, the accuracy of the network node feature selection method is 69.68%. It can be seen that the third method has higher accuracy and lower dimensionality. In the online teaching of multimodal smart music based on audio and lyrics, this article improves the traditional fusion method for the problem of multimodal fusion and compares various fusion methods through experiments. The experimental results show that the improved classification effect of the fusion method is the best, reaching 84.43%, which verifies the feasibility and effectiveness of the method.", "The latest severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variant Omicron (B.1.1.529) has ushered panic responses around the world due to its contagious and vaccine escape mutations. The essential infectivity and antibody resistance of the SARS-CoV-2 variant are determined by its mutations on the spike (S) protein receptor-binding domain (RBD). However, a complete experimental evaluation of Omicron might take weeks or even months. Here, we present a comprehensive quantitative analysis of Omicron's infectivity, vaccine-breakthrough, and antibody resistance. An artificial intelligence (AI) model, which has been trained with tens of thousands of experimental data points and extensively validated by experimental data on SARS-CoV-2, reveals that Omicron may be over ten times more contagious than the original virus or about twice as infectious as the Delta variant. Based on 132 three-dimensional (3D) structures of antibody-RBD complexes, we unveil that Omicron may be twice more likely to escape current vaccines than the Delta variant. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from Eli Lilly may be seriously compromised. Omicron may also diminish the efficacy of mAbs from Celltrion and Rockefeller University. However, its impact on Regeneron mAb cocktail appears to be mild.", "To investigate how an artificial intelligence (AI) system performs at digital mammography (DM) from a screening population with ground truth defined by digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT), and whether AI could detect breast cancers at DM that had originally only been detected at DBT.\nIn this secondary analysis of data from a prospective study, DM examinations from 14\u2009768 women (mean age, 57 years), examined with both DM and DBT with independent double reading in the Malm\u04e7 Breast Tomosynthesis Screening Trial (MBTST) (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01091545; data collection, 2010-2015), were analyzed with an AI system. Of 136 screening-detected cancers, 95 cancers were detected at DM and 41 cancers were detected only at DBT. The system identifies suspicious areas in the image, scored 1-100, and provides a risk score of 1 to 10 for the whole examination. A cancer was defined as AI detected if the cancer lesion was correctly localized and scored at least 62 (threshold determined by the AI system developers), therefore resulting in the highest examination risk score of 10. Data were analyzed with descriptive statistics, and detection performance was analyzed with receiver operating characteristics.\nThe highest examination risk score was assigned to 10% (1493 of 14\u2009786) of the examinations. With 90.8% specificity, the AI system detected 75% (71 of 95) of the DM-detected cancers and 44% (18 of 41) of cancers at DM that had originally been detected only at DBT. The majority were invasive cancers (17 of 18).\nAlmost half of the additional DBT-only screening-detected cancers in the MBTST were detected at DM with AI. AI did not reach double reading performance; however, if combined with double reading, AI has the potential to achieve a substantial portion of the benefit of DBT screening.Keywords: Computer-aided Diagnosis, Mammography, Breast, Diagnosis, Classification, Application DomainClinical trial registration no.

Using artificial intelligence, in particular, different machine learning techniques, is a necessary step for better data exploitation. Classically, researchers in this field of radiomics have used conventional machine learning techniques (random forest, for example). More recently, deep learning, a subdomain of machine learning, has emerged. Its applications are increasing, and the results obtained so far have demonstrated their remarkable effectiveness. Several previous studies have explored the potential applications of radiomics in colorectal cancer. These potential applications can be grouped into several categories like evaluation of the reproducibility of texture data, prediction of response to treatment, prediction of the occurrence of metastases, and prediction of survival. Few studies, however, have explored the potential of radiomics in predicting recurrence-free survival. In this study, we evaluated and compared six conventional learning models and a deep learning model, based on MRI textural analysis of patients with locally advanced rectal tumours, correlated with the risk of recidivism; in traditional learning, we compared 2D image analysis models vs. 3D image analysis models, models based on a textural analysis of the tumour versus models taking into account the peritumoural environment in addition to the tumour itself. In deep learning, we built a 16-layer convolutional neural network model, driven by a 2D MRI image database comprising both the native images and the bounding box corresponding to each image.", "One of the major health concerns for human society is skin cancer. When the pigments producing skin color turn carcinogenic, this disease gets contracted. A skin cancer diagnosis is a challenging process for dermatologists as many skin cancer pigments may appear similar in appearance. Hence, early detection of lesions (which form the base of skin cancer) is definitely critical and useful to completely cure the patients suffering from skin cancer. Significant progress has been made in developing automated tools for the diagnosis of skin cancer to assist dermatologists. The worldwide acceptance of artificial intelligence-supported tools has permitted usage of the enormous collection of images of lesions and benevolent sores approved by histopathology. This paper performs a comparative analysis of six different transfer learning nets for multi-class skin cancer classification by taking the HAM10000 dataset. We used replication of images of classes with low frequencies to counter the imbalance in the dataset. The transfer learning nets that were used in the analysis were VGG19, InceptionV3, InceptionResNetV2, ResNet50, Xception, and MobileNet. Results demonstrate that replication is suitable for this task, achieving high classification accuracies and F-measures with lower false negatives. It is inferred that Xception Net outperforms the rest of the transfer learning nets used for the study, with an accuracy of 90.48. It also has the highest recall, precision, and F-Measure values.", "This study aimed to explore the moderating effects of the frequently used cognitive reserve (CR) proxies [i.e., education, premorbid intelligence quotient (pIQ), occupational complexity (OC), and lifetime cognitive activity (LCA)] on the relationships between various in vivo Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathologies and cognition. In total, 351 [268 cognitively unimpaired (CU), 83 cognitive impaired (CI)] older adults underwent multi-modal brain imaging to measure AD pathologies and cognitive assessments, and information on CR proxies was obtained. For overall participants, only education moderated the relationship between A\u03b2 deposition and cognition. Education, pIQ, and LCA, but not OC, showed moderating effect on the relationship between AD-signature cerebral hypometabolism and cognition. In contrast, only OC had a moderating effect on the relationship between cortical atrophy of the AD-signature regions and cognition. Such moderation effects of the CR proxies were similarly observed in CI individuals, but most of them were not in CU individuals. The findings suggest that the proposed CR proxies have different moderating effects on the relationships between specific AD pathologies and cognition.", "The prevalence of the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 disease has resulted in the unprecedented collection of health data to support research. Historically, coordinating the collation of such datasets on a national scale has been challenging to execute for several reasons, including issues with data privacy, the lack of data reporting standards, interoperable technologies, and distribution methods. The coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 disease pandemic has highlighted the importance of collaboration between government bodies, healthcare institutions, academic researchers and commercial companies in overcoming these issues during times of urgency. The National COVID-19 Chest Imaging Database, led by NHSX, British Society of Thoracic Imaging, Royal Surrey NHS Foundation Trust and Faculty, is an example of such a national initiative. Here, we summarise the experiences and challenges of setting up the National COVID-19 Chest Imaging Database, and the implications for future ambitions of national data curation in medical imaging to advance the safe adoption of artificial intelligence in healthcare.", "We review the history of nuclear medicine physics, instrumentation, and data sciences in Korea to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the Korean Society of Nuclear Medicine. In the 1970s and 1980s, the development of SPECT, nuclear stethoscope, and bone densitometry systems, as well as kidney and cardiac image analysis technology, marked the beginning of nuclear medicine physics and engineering in Korea. With the introduction of PET and cyclotron in Korea in 1994, nuclear medicine imaging research was further activated. With the support of large-scale government projects, the development of gamma camera, SPECT, and PET systems was carried out. Exploiting the use of PET scanners in conjunction with cyclotrons, extensive studies on myocardial blood flow quantification and brain image analysis were also actively pursued. In 2005, Korea's first domestic cyclotron succeeded in producing radioactive isotopes, and the cyclotron was provided to six universities and university hospitals, thereby facilitating the nationwide supply of PET radiopharmaceuticals. Since the late 2000s, research on PET/MRI has been actively conducted, and the advanced research results of Korean scientists in the fields of silicon photomultiplier PET and simultaneous PET/MRI have attracted significant attention from the academic community. Currently, Korean researchers are actively involved in endeavors to solve a variety of complex problems in nuclear medicine using artificial intelligence and deep learning technologies.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) is the science that deals with creating 'intelligent machines'. AI has revolutionized medicine because of its application in several fields across medicine like radiology, neurology, ophthalmology, orthopedics and gastroenterology.\u00a0In this review, we intend to summarize the basics of AI, the application of AI in various gastrointestinal pathologies till date as well as challenges/ problems related to the application of AI in medicine.\u00a0Literature search using keywords like artificial intelligence, gastroenterology, applications, etc. were used. The literature search was done using Google Scholar, PubMed and ScienceDirect. All the relevant articles were gathered and relevant data were extracted from them. We concluded AI has achieved major feats in the past few decades. It has helped clinicians in diagnosing complex diseases, managing treatments as well as in predicting outcomes, all in all, which helps doctors from all over the globe in dispensing better healthcare services.", "Social disparities in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) outcomes are preventable, costly, and unjust. We sought to perform the first large artificial intelligence- (AI-) guided statistical and geographic information system (GIS) analysis of a multiyear and multisite cohort for OHCA outcomes (incidence and poor neurological disposition).\nWe conducted a retrospective cohort analysis of a prospectively collected multicenter dataset of adult patients who sequentially presented to Houston metro area hospitals from 01/01/07-01/01/16. Then AI-based machine learning (backward propagation neural network) augmented multivariable regression and GIS heat mapping were performed.\nOf 3,952 OHCA patients across 38 hospitals, African Americans were the most likely to suffer OHCA despite representing a significantly lower percentage of the population (42.6 versus 22.8%; p < 0.001). Compared to Caucasians, they were significantly more likely to have poor neurological disposition (OR 2.21, 95%CI 1.25-3.92; p=0.006) and be discharged to a facility instead of home (OR 1.39, 95%CI 1.05-1.85; p=0.023). Compared to the safety net hospital system primarily serving poorer African Americans, the university hospital serving primarily higher income commercially and Medicare insured patients had the lowest odds of death (OR 0.45, p < 0.001). Each additional $10,000 above median household income was associated with a decrease in the total number of cardiac arrests per zip code by 2.86 (95%CI -4.26- -1.46; p < 0.001); zip codes with a median income above $54,600 versus the federal poverty level had 14.62 fewer arrests (p < 0.001). GIS maps showed convergence of the greater density of poor neurologic outcome cases and greater density of poorer African American residences.\nThis large, longitudinal AI-guided analysis statistically and geographically identifies racial and socioeconomic disparities in OHCA outcomes in a way that may allow targeted medical and public health coordinated efforts to improve clinical, cost, and social equity outcomes.", "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the revolutionary paradigm to empower sixth generation (6G) edge computing based e-healthcare for everyone. Thus, this research aims to promote an AI-based cost-effective and efficient healthcare application. The cyber physical system (CPS) is a key player in the internet world where humans and their personal devices such as cell phones, laptops, wearables, etc., facilitate the healthcare environment. The data extracting, examining and monitoring strategies from sensors and actuators in the entire medical landscape are facilitated by cloud-enabled technologies for absorbing and accepting the entire emerging wave of revolution. The efficient and accurate examination of voluminous data from the sensor devices poses restrictions in terms of bandwidth, delay and energy. Due to the heterogeneous nature of the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT), the driven healthcare system must be smart, interoperable, convergent, and reliable to provide pervasive and cost-effective healthcare platforms. Unfortunately, because of higher power consumption and lesser packet delivery rate, achieving interoperable, convergent, and reliable transmission is challenging in connected healthcare. In such a scenario, this paper has fourfold major contributions. The first contribution is the development of a single chip wearable electrocardiogram (ECG) with the support of an analog front end (AFE) chip model (i.e., ADS1292R) for gathering the ECG data to examine the health status of elderly or chronic patients with the IoT-based cyber physical system (CPS). The second proposes a fuzzy-based sustainable, interoperable, and reliable algorithm (FSIRA), which is an intelligent and self-adaptive decision-making approach to prioritize emergency and critical patients in association with the selected parameters for improving healthcare quality at reasonable costs. The third is the proposal of a specific cloud-based architecture for mobile and connected healthcare. The fourth is the identification of the right balance between reliability, packet loss ratio, convergence, latency, interoperability, and throughput to support an adaptive IoMT driven connected healthcare. It is examined and observed that our proposed approaches outperform the conventional techniques by providing high reliability, high convergence, interoperability, and a better foundation to analyze and interpret the accuracy in systems from a medical health aspect. As for the IoMT, an enabled healthcare cloud is the key ingredient on which to focus, as it also faces the big hurdle of less bandwidth, more delay and energy drain. Thus, we propose the mathematical trade-offs between bandwidth, interoperability, reliability, delay, and energy dissipation for IoMT-oriented smart healthcare over a 6G platform.", "This study aimed to investigate the time lag between onset and treatment (treatment delay) for alcohol use disorders (AUD) and associations between demographic factors and treatment delay for AUD.\nThe study included 6,584 men registered in the Copenhagen Alcohol Cohort, containing information on civil status, employment status, estimated age at onset of alcohol problems, and age at first outpatient AUD treatment. Data on year of birth, intelligence, and educational level were obtained from the Danish Conscription Database. Information on first hospital AUD treatment was retrieved from Danish national psychiatric registers. Associations between the demographic factors and treatment delay were analysed in separate linear regression models adjusted for year of birth and in a mutually adjusted model including all demographic factors.\nThe mean treatment delay for AUD was 6.9\u2009years (SD = 4.1). After mutual adjustment, an SD increase in intelligence score was associated with 0.17\u2009years increase in treatment delay. Educational level was unrelated to treatment delay. Men with estimated age at onset of alcohol problems at age 20\u2009years or younger had a 5.30\u2009years longer treatment delay than men who had estimated age at onset of alcohol problems at age 51\u2009years or older. Employed men had shorter treatment delays than unemployed men, especially among the oldest birth cohorts.\nThe treatment delay of 6.9\u2009years highlights the necessity to promote access to AUD treatment, perhaps in particular among adolescents and young individuals. Cognitive factors may affect treatment delay more than non-cognitive personal factors.", "In March 2021, the Radiological Society of North America hosted a virtual panel discussion with members of the Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention Society. Both organizations share a vision to develop radiologic and medical imaging techniques through advanced quantitative imaging biomarkers and artificial intelligence. The panel addressed how radiologists and data scientists can collaborate to advance the science of AI in radiology.

This study uses the situational experiment method to explore the effects of OTA employees' emotional intelligence and emotional labor (surface behavior and deep behavior) on the effect of service recovery. The results show that the emotional intelligence of OTA employees has a positive impact on the surface behavior and deep behavior; the emotional intelligence and deep behavior of employees have a significant positive impact on service recovery satisfaction, but the positive impact of employees' surface behavior on service recovery satisfaction is not statistically significant; finally, service recovery satisfaction has a positive impact on customer loyalty. This study helps to better explain the mechanism of OTA service recovery effect and provides a theoretical reference for improving the service recovery effect of OTA.", "Neurosurgeons receive extensive and lengthy training to equip themselves with various technical skills, and neurosurgery require a great deal of pre-, intra- and postoperative clinical data collection, decision making, care and recovery. The last decade has seen a significant increase in the importance of artificial intelligence (AI) in neurosurgery. AI can provide a great promise in neurosurgery by complementing neurosurgeons' skills to provide the best possible interventional and noninterventional care for patients by enhancing diagnostic and prognostic outcomes in clinical treatment and help neurosurgeons with decision making during surgical interventions to improve patient outcomes. Furthermore, AI is playing a pivotal role in the production, processing and storage of clinical and experimental data. AI usage in neurosurgery can also reduce the costs associated with surgical care and provide high-quality healthcare to a broader population. Additionally, AI and neurosurgery can build a symbiotic relationship where AI helps to push the boundaries of neurosurgery, and neurosurgery can help AI to develop better and more robust algorithms. This review explores the role of AI in interventional and noninterventional aspects of neurosurgery during pre-, intra- and postoperative care, such as diagnosis, clinical decision making, surgical operation, prognosis, data acquisition, and research within the neurosurgical arena.", "The image of a politician primes people to judge his/her personality traits. Voters are looking for such qualities as honesty, intelligence, friendliness, sincerity, and trustworthiness. Most studies, however, concentrate on the evaluation of faces, and only some take into account the candidate's attire.\nThe research included 320 participants between 18 and 78 years. It aimed to assess whether the parliamentary candidate's attire affects voters' evaluation of his personality traits. A description of his program was also presented to determine whether it affected the candidate's evaluation. Participants observed four versions of a fictional candidate's election materials: the candidate dressed in a formal suit or dressed casually and dressed formally or casually but bearing a doctor's degree. We used a self-constructed questionnaire to evaluate selected traits of the candidate's character.\nThe findings revealed that participants believed an individual in casual wear to be more active, attractive, open to people and the world, friendly, honest, and reliable, and only more smart, and effective while dressed formally. Also, the academic degree proved to be of importance. Accordingly, the same person with a doctorate was additionally evaluated as competent, responsible when dressed casually, and responsible when wearing a suit. It confirms the assumption that the informal dress and academic degree are most influential. The program description proved to be of no significance.\nOur study shows that the way the candidate was dressed affected the evaluation of his personality characteristics. The participants attributed the casually dressed candidate the traits expected from a politician.", "The development of artificial intelligence and worldwide epidemic events has promoted the implementation of smart healthcare while bringing issues of data privacy, malicious attack, and service quality. The Medical Internet of Things (MIoT), along with the technologies of federated learning and blockchain, has become a feasible solution for these issues. In this paper, we present a blockchain-based federated learning method for smart healthcare in which the edge nodes maintain the blockchain to resist a single point of failure and MIoT devices implement the federated learning to make full of the distributed clinical data. In particular, we design an adaptive differential privacy algorithm to protect data privacy and gradient verification-based consensus protocol to detect poisoning attacks. We compare our method with two similar methods on a real-world diabetes dataset. Promising experimental results show that our method can achieve high model accuracy in acceptable running time while also showing good performance in reducing the privacy budget consumption and resisting poisoning attacks.", "It has been said that COVID-19 is a generational challenge in many ways. But, at the same time, it becomes a catalyst for collective action, innovation, and discovery. Realizing the full potential of artificial intelligence (AI) for structure determination of unknown proteins and drug discovery are some of these innovations. Potential applications of AI include predicting the structure of the infectious proteins, identifying drugs that may be effective in targeting these proteins, and proposing new chemical compounds for further testing as potential drugs. AI and machine learning (ML) allow for rapid drug development including repurposing existing drugs. Algorithms were used to search for novel or approved antiviral drugs capable of inhibiting SARS-CoV-2. This paper presents a survey of AI and ML methods being used in various biochemistry of SARS-CoV-2, from structure to drug development, in the fight against the deadly COVID-19 pandemic. It is envisioned that this study will provide AI/ML researchers and the wider community an overview of the current status of AI applications particularly in structural biology, drug repurposing, and development, and motivate researchers in harnessing AI potentials in the fight against COVID-19.", "There is a clear predominance of programmes aimed at improving aspects related to language production in pupils with developmental language disorder (DLD). However, programmes aimed at improving their receptive skills are limited.\nThe main aim was to assess the effectiveness of an intervention programme for oral language comprehension skills in preschoolers with typical development (TD) and pupils with DLD.\nParticipants were 99 five-year-old pupils, with and without DLD, divided into four groups: two control groups (TD-C = 25; DLD-C = 25) and two experimental groups (TD-T = 24; DLD-T = 25), from schools on the Spanish island of Tenerife. The study used, as pre- and post-measures, the receptive language subtests of the CELF-4-Spanish: Concepts and Following Directions, Word Classes-Receptive and Sentence Structure, as well as two tasks assessing comprehension of paragraphs and narratives. Due to the strong link between oral comprehension skills and executive functions, working memory and semantic fluency are included in this research. The Backward Digit Span subtest of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC-IV) and Semantic Fluency subtest of the Controlled Oral Word Association Test (COWAT) were used to assess working memory and semantic fluency, respectively. The intervention programme followed a multitiered system of support (MTSS) model, with 95 sessions lasting 60 min each delivered jointly by teachers and speech and language therapists, and focused on lexical-semantic, morphological, syntactic and narrative skills; inferences; verbal working memory; and semantic fluency.\nThe results showed, as expected, that pupils diagnosed with DLD initially performed worse on oral language comprehension and executive functions than pupils with TD. Further, the DLD-T and TD-T groups showed greater gains following the programme, especially in word classes-receptive, sentence structure, verbal working memory and semantic fluency. Finally, a significant positive correlation was found between the gains obtained by the participants in verbal working memory and semantic fluency, with the gains obtained in the three CELF-4-Spanish subtests.\nAn intervention programme applied at an early age fosters oral language comprehension skills and executive functions in pupils with DLD and TD. The intervention organized at different levels of support, following an MTSS model, showed clear progress of the DLD and TD groups in oral language comprehension and executive functions.\nPupils with DLD present deficits in linguistic comprehension and executive functions. There are many intervention programs focused on improving language production skills. It is also necessary to consider the skills underlying language problems in pupils with DLD. Oral language, inference, working memory and semantic fluency activities improve comprehension. A collaborative and inclusive intervention of teachers and speech language therapists. Psycholinguistic and neuropsychological skills training should become part of the academic curriculum as early as preschool age. What is already known on the subject Pupils with DLD show problems related to both comprehension and production language. However, there is a clear predominance of programs just aimed at improving aspects related to language production. Clinical implications of this study An intervention program applied at an early age fosters oral language comprehension skills and executive function in pupils with DLD. The intervention organized at different levels of support, following an adaptation of the Response Tier Intervention models, showed clear progress of the DLD in comprehension oral language and executive functions.", "On March 16, 2020, French schools suddenly closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and middle school students were asked to study from home with no direct interactions with teachers or classmates. However, school plays an important role in the development of social, intellectual, and mental competencies and can counteract the negative effects of adverse life events on learning and early school dropout. In this study, we investigated how the unusual context of school closure during the COVID-19 pandemic affected school engagement. Specifically, we focused on inter-individual differences in the motivational determinants of school engagement. We thus performed an online survey of 170 students focusing on the time spent on mathematics assignments, motivation regulation, implicit theories of intelligence, such as adopting a growth or a fixed mindset about his/her intellectual abilities, and optimism. Importantly, the students participated in the online survey during the first lockdown period, with schools closed (T1), and the second lockdown period, with schools remaining open (T2). During T1, identified motivation positively predicted the time spent on math homework assignments: the more the students thought that working on math exercises was useful for their future life, the more time they spent studying. Importantly, the link between identified motivation and school engagement was specific to T1, when schools were closed, as indicated by a significant interaction between identified motivations by type of lockdown. These results suggest that having self-determined motivation is of particular importance when students are deprived of social and intellectual interactions with classmates and teachers. This finding paves the way toward the development of wise rational interventions that target identified motivation and can be applied during challenging societal times and adverse, common life events to keep students engaged with school.", "Although there are millions of left-behind children in China, the researches on brain structure and functions in left-behind children are not sufficient at the brain imaging level. This study aimed to explore whether there is decreased prefrontal synchronization during joint attention in left-behind children. Sixty children (65.12 \u00b1 6.54 months, 29 males) with 34 left-behind children were recruited. The functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) imaging data from the prefrontal cortex during joint attention, as well as behavioral measures (associated with family income, intelligence, language, and social-emotional abilities), were collected. Results verified that brain imaging data and behavioral measures are correlative and support that left-behind children have deficits in social-emotional abilities. More importantly, left-behind children showed decreased synchronization strength and asymmetry in the right middle frontal gyrus during joint attention. The findings suggest that decreased right prefrontal synchronization strength and asymmetry during joint attention might be vulnerability factors in the development of left-behind children.", "Today Artificial Intelligence (AI) supports difficult decisions about policy, health, and our personal lives. The AI algorithms we develop and deploy to make sense of information, are informed by data, and based on models that capture and use pertinent details of the population or phenomenon being analyzed. For any application area, more importantly in precision medicine which directly impacts human lives, the data upon which algorithms are run must be procured, cleaned, and organized well to assure reliable and interpretable results, and to assure that they do not perpetrate or amplify human prejudices. This must be done without violating basic assumptions of the algorithms in use. Algorithmic results need to be clearly communicated to stakeholders and domain experts to enable sound conclusions. Our position is that AI holds great promise for supporting precision medicine, but we need to move forward with great care, with consideration for possible ethical implications. We make the case that a no-boundary or convergent approach is essential to support sound and ethical decisions. No-boundary thinking supports problem definition and solving with teams of experts possessing diverse perspectives. When dealing with AI and the data needed\u00a0to use AI, there is a spectrum of activities that needs the attention of a no-boundary team. This is necessary if we are to draw viable conclusions and develop actions and policies based on the AI, the data, and the scientific foundations of the domain in question.", "The inverse relationship between test anxiety and test performance is commonly explained by test-anxious students' tendency to worry about a test and the consequences of failing. However, other cognitive facets of test anxiety have been identified that could account for this link, including interference by test-irrelevant thoughts and lack of confidence. In this study, we compare different facets of test anxiety in predicting test performance. Seven hundred thirty university students filled out the German Test Anxiety Inventory after completing a battery of standardized tests assessing general intelligence and mathematical competencies. Multiple regressions revealed that interference and lack of confidence but not worry or arousal explained unique variance in students' test performance. No evidence was found for a curvilinear relationship between arousal and performance. The present results call for revisiting the role of worries in explaining the test anxiety-performance link and can help educators to identify students who are especially at risk of underperforming on tests.", "The development of novel technologies has increasingly complicated the issue of users' privacy. This study aimed to investigate the impact that the types of information as well as agents have on perceptions of privacy risks and concerns. The results showed that participants perceived privacy risk and were most concerned when they were asked to provide digital life information, followed by being asked for digital footprint information, and even more so when they were asked to provide this information to a human agent instead of an artificial intelligence agent. However, there were no differences in the perception of privacy risks and concerns with respect to self-expression and demographic information. The implications of these findings are also discussed.", "This paper provides an in-depth analysis and research on piano timbre teaching in the context of artificial intelligence interaction, a bold vision of piano teaching, proposes a feasible solution in terms of teaching modules in intelligent piano teaching for senior teachers, and proposes an implementation path for the integration of intelligent piano and piano teaching from the four main blocks of piano teaching. Based on the multiplicative harmonic model of monophonic signal, combined with the variability of timbre characteristics, an audio synthesis model with editable timbre is proposed, and the experimental results show that editing the timbre parameters in the model can realize timbre modification, and the synthesized timbre conforms to the piano timbre characteristics. Based on the timbre analysis and the timbre synthesis model, a piano timbre library generation system is designed. The detailed design of the software modules such as audio file reading and writing, audio information analysis, timbre parameter acquisition, timbre synthesis, and simulated performance is given. The system can generate piano timbre libraries of different qualities flexibly and meet the requirements of timbre realism. The teaching experiment designed for teaching practice from solo teaching, and the practice target is first-year undergraduate students in the university, and the practice period is six weeks, and finally, the feasibility of intelligent piano teaching application is analysed by combining the experimental results. Through the teaching objectives, teaching content, and teaching methods, teaching environment reflects intelligent piano teaching to make up for the limitations of traditional piano teaching. Analyse the development trend of intelligent piano teaching in the context of artificial intelligence interaction, and explore the value of intelligent piano teaching.", "We aimed to develop models to detect aortic stenosis (AS) from chest radiographs-one of the most basic imaging tests-with artificial intelligence.\nWe used 10\u200a433 retrospectively collected digital chest radiographs from 5638 patients to train, validate, and test three deep learning models. Chest radiographs were collected from patients who had also undergone echocardiography at a single institution between July 2016 and May 2019. These were labelled from the corresponding echocardiography assessments as AS-positive or AS-negative. The radiographs were separated on a patient basis into training [8327 images from 4512 patients, mean age 65\u2009\u00b1\u2009 (standard deviation) 15\u2009years], validation (1041 images from 563 patients, mean age 65\u2009\u00b1\u200914\u2009years), and test (1065 images from 563 patients, mean age 65\u2009\u00b1\u200914\u2009years) datasets. The soft voting-based ensemble of the three developed models had the best overall performance for predicting AS with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of 0.83 (95% confidence interval 0.77-0.88), 0.78 (0.67-0.86), 0.71 (0.68-0.73), 0.71 (0.68-0.74), 0.18 (0.14-0.23), and 0.97 (0.96-0.98), respectively, in the validation dataset and 0.83 (0.78-0.88), 0.83 (0.74-0.90), 0.69 (0.66-0.72), 0.71 (0.68-0.73), 0.23 (0.19-0.28), and 0.97 (0.96-0.98), respectively, in the test dataset.\nDeep learning models using chest radiographs have the potential to differentiate between radiographs of patients with and without AS.\nWe created artificial intelligence (AI) models using deep learning to identify aortic stenosis (AS) from chest radiographs. Three AI models were developed and evaluated with 10\u200a433 retrospectively collected radiographs and labelled from echocardiography reports. The ensemble AI model could detect AS in a test dataset with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.83 (95% confidence interval 0.78-0.88). Since chest radiography is a cost-effective and widely available imaging test, our model can provide an additive resource for the detection of AS.", "Traditionally, people with aphasia (PWA) are treated with impairment-based language therapy to improve receptive and expressive language skills. In addition to language deficits, PWA are often affected by some level of working memory (WM) impairments. Both language and working memory impairments combined have a negative impact on PWA's quality of life. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the application of intermittent theta-burst stimulation (iTBS) combined with computerized WM training will result in near-ransfer effects (i.e., trained WM) and far-transfer effects (i.e., untrained language tasks) and have a positive effect on the quality of life of PWA.\nThe participant was a 63-year-old Greek-Cypriot male who presented with mild receptive aphasia and short-term memory difficulties. Treatment was carried out using a multiple baseline (MB) design composed of a pretherapy or baseline testing phase, a therapy phase, and a posttherapy/follow-up phase. The treatment program involved iTBS application to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), an area responsible for WM, for 10 consecutive sessions. The participant received a 3-minute iTBS application followed by 30-minute computer-assisted WM training. Outcome measures included a WM screening test, a standardized aphasia test, a nonverbal intelligence test, story-telling speech samples, a procedural discourse task, and a questionnaire addressing quality of life. These measures were performed three times before the treatment, immediately upon completion of the treatment, and once during follow-up testing at 3 months posttreatment.\nWe found a beneficial effect of iTBS and WM training on naming, reading, WM, reasoning, narrative, communication efficiency, and quality of life (QoL). Implications for Rehabilitation. Noninvasive brain stimulation combined with computerized WM training may be used in aphasia rehabilitation to improve WM and generalize to language improvement.", "The number of applications for facial recognition technology is increasing due to the improvement in image quality, artificial intelligence, and computer processing power that has occurred during the last decades. Algorithms can be used to convert facial anthropometric landmarks into a computer representation, which can be used to help identify nonverbal information about an individual's health status. This article discusses the potential ways a facial recognition tool can perform a health assessment. Because facial attributes may be considered biometric data, clinicians should be informed about the clinical, ethical, and legal issues associated with its use.", "Computer tools based on artificial intelligence could aid clinicians in memory clinics in several ways, such as by supporting diagnostic decision-making, web-based cognitive testing, and the communication of diagnosis and prognosis.\nThis study aims to identify the preferences as well as the main barriers and facilitators related to using computer tools in memory clinics for all end users, that is, clinicians, patients, and care partners.\nBetween July and October 2020, we sent out invitations to a web-based survey to clinicians using the European Alzheimer's Disease Centers network and the Dutch Memory Clinic network, and 109 clinicians participated (mean age 45 years, SD 10; 53/109, 48.6% female). A second survey was created for patients and care partners. They were invited via Alzheimer Europe, Alzheimer's Society United Kingdom, Amsterdam Dementia Cohort, and Amsterdam Aging Cohort. A total of 50 patients with subjective cognitive decline, mild cognitive impairment, or dementia (mean age 73 years, SD 8; 17/34, 34% female) and 46 care partners (mean age 65 years, SD 12; 25/54, 54% female) participated in this survey.\nMost clinicians reported a willingness to use diagnostic (88/109, 80.7%) and prognostic (83/109, 76.1%) computer tools. User-friendliness (71/109, 65.1%); Likert scale mean 4.5, SD 0.7), and increasing diagnostic accuracy (76/109, 69.7%; mean 4.3, SD 0.7) were reported as the main factors stimulating the adoption of a tool. Tools should also save time and provide clear information on reliability and validity. Inadequate integration with electronic patient records (46/109, 42.2%; mean 3.8, SD 1.0) and fear of losing important clinical information (48/109, 44%; mean 3.7, SD 1.2) were most frequently indicated as barriers. Patients and care partners were equally positive about the use of computer tools by clinicians, both for diagnosis (69/96, 72%) and prognosis (73/96, 76%). In addition, most of them thought favorably regarding the possibility of using the tools themselves.\nThis study showed that computer tools in memory clinics are positively valued by most end users. For further development and implementation, it is essential to overcome the technical and practical barriers of a tool while paying utmost attention to its reliability and validity.", "This paper conducts in-depth research and analysis on the construction of the public information product APP application platform of urban big media in the context of artificial intelligence and discusses its development. Based on the improvement of the SICAS model, a model of enterprise and user information interaction characteristics in the new media environment is constructed, and social network analysis and semantic analysis methods are used to research enterprise and user information interaction characteristics in the new media environment. The point degree centrality index is used to analyze forwarding and being forwarded behavior in information interaction, the intermediate centrality index is used to analyze following and being followed behavior, the proximity centrality index is used to analyze commenting and being commented behavior, the feature vector centrality index is used to analyze the cohesiveness of information interaction behavior, and the semantic keyword word is used to analyze the semantic keyword word in the research process. The results of the study show that the constructed model can analyze the information interaction behaviors of enterprises and users in the new media environment. The research results show that the constructed model can systematically analyze the information interaction characteristics, and the information interaction between enterprises and users in the new media environment is more timely, more effective, and more satisfying to users. The current situation of the construction of the public information platform and the problems existing in the construction are proposed to achieve the standardization of the construction of the public information platform in the context of smart city, the construction of the platform supervision system, and the strengthening of information security publicity and talent training. To offer a suitable platform and provide efficient solutions for the development of a public information service platform in the city, enhance the professional quality of research papers and dissertations, as well as the solutions' operability. More public services will be provided in a highly connected way across the boundaries between government, enterprises, society, and citizens and even form a public service market that accepts autonomous choices and becomes an important part of the digital economy, thus finding a good balance between economic development and social welfare.", "Scientific research consistently demonstrates that diseases may be delayed, treated, or even prevented and, thereby, health may be maintained with health-promoting functional food ingredients (FFIs). Consumers are increasingly demanding sound information about food, nutrition, nutrients, and their associated health benefits. Consequently, a nutrition industry is being formed around natural foods and FFIs, the economic growth of which is increasingly driven by consumer decisions. Information technology, in particular artificial intelligence (AI), is primed to vastly expand the pool of characterised and annotated FFIs available to consumers, by systematically discovering and characterising natural, efficacious, and safe bioactive ingredients (bioactives) that address specific health needs. However, FFI-producing companies are lagging in adopting AI technology for their ingredient development pipelines for several reasons, resulting in a lack of efficient means for large-scale and high-throughput molecular and functional ingredient characterisation. The arrival of the AI-led technological revolution allows for the comprehensive characterisation and understanding of the universe of FFI molecules, enabling the mining of the food and natural product space in an unprecedented manner. In turn, this expansion of bioactives dramatically increases the repertoire of FFIs available to the consumer, ultimately resulting in bioactives being specifically developed to target unmet health needs.", "Integration of artificial intelligence (AI) applications within clinical workflows is an important step for leveraging developed AI algorithms. In this report, generalizable components for deploying AI systems into clinical practice are described that were implemented in a clinical pilot study using lymphoscintigraphy examinations as a prospective use case (July 1, 2019-October 31, 2020). Deployment of the AI algorithm consisted of seven software components, as follows: (a) image delivery, (b) quality control, (c) a results database, (d) results processing, (e) results presentation and delivery, (f) error correction, and (g) a dashboard for performance monitoring. A total of 14 users used the system (faculty radiologists and trainees) to assess the degree of satisfaction with the components and overall workflow. Analyses included the assessment of the number of examinations processed, error rates, and corrections. The AI system processed 1748 lymphoscintigraphy examinations. The system enabled radiologists to correct 146 AI results, generating real-time corrections to the radiology report. All AI results and corrections were successfully stored in a database for downstream use by the various integration components. A dashboard allowed monitoring of the AI system performance in real time. All 14 survey respondents \"somewhat agreed\" or \"strongly agreed\" that the AI system was well integrated into the clinical workflow. In all, a framework of processes and components for integrating AI algorithms into clinical workflows was developed. The implementation described could be helpful for assessing and monitoring AI performance in clinical practice.

A series of postoperative nursing was carried out. The surgical results showed that 42 patients with Da Vinci robot-assisted lobectomy had operation time of 62-225\u2009min and blood loss of 70-300\u2009mL. There was no intraoperative blood transfusion, the intraoperative central rate was maintained at 60-100 times/min, and the blood pressure was maintained at 90-140/60-90\u2009mmHg. No patient was transferred to thoracotomy, and 2 patients were performed robotic wedge resection first, and then, robotic lobectomy was performed after malignant tumor was confirmed by freezing results, with relatively light postoperative pain, no infection, beautiful wound, and smooth recovery and discharge. Robot-assisted lobectomy is a new technique with advantages of less trauma, less pain, faster recovery, and safer and more thorough lymph node dissection.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) is widely positioned to become a key element of intelligent technologies used in the long-term care (LTC) for older adults. The increasing relevance and adoption of AI has encouraged debate over the societal and ethical implications of introducing and scaling AI. This scoping review investigates how the design and implementation of AI technologies in LTC is addressed responsibly: so-called responsible innovation (RI).\nWe conducted a systematic literature search in 5 electronic databases using concepts related to LTC, AI, and RI. We then performed a descriptive and thematic analysis to map the key concepts, types of evidence, and gaps in the literature.\nAfter reviewing 3,339 papers, 25 papers were identified that met our inclusion criteria. From this literature, we extracted 3 overarching themes: user-oriented AI innovation; framing AI as a solution to RI issues; and context-sensitivity. Our results provide an overview of measures taken and recommendations provided to address responsible AI innovation in LTC.\nThe review underlines the importance of the context of use when addressing responsible AI innovation in LTC. However, limited empirical evidence actually details how responsible AI innovation is addressed in context. Therefore, we recommend expanding empirical studies on RI at the level of specific AI technologies and their local contexts of use. Also, we call for more specific frameworks for responsible AI innovation in LTC to flexibly guide researchers and innovators. Future frameworks should clearly distinguish between RI processes and outcomes.", "This study is informed by two research gaps. One, Artificial Intelligence's (AI's) Machine Learning (ML) techniques have the potential to help separate information and misinformation, but this capability has yet to be empirically verified in the context of COVID-19. Two, while older adults can be particularly susceptible to the virus as well as its online infodemic, their information processing behaviour amid the pandemic has not been understood. Therefore, this study explores and understands how ML techniques (Study 1), and humans, particularly older adults (Study 2), process the online infodemic regarding COVID-19 prevention and cure. Study 1 employed ML techniques to classify information and misinformation. They achieved a classification accuracy of 86.7% with the Decision Tree classifier, and 86.67% with the Convolutional Neural Network model. Study 2 then investigated older adults' information processing behaviour during the COVID-19 infodemic period using some of the posts from Study 1. Twenty older adults were interviewed. They were found to be more willing to trust traditional media rather than new media. They were often left confused about the veracity of online content related to COVID-19 prevention and cure. Overall, the paper breaks new ground by highlighting how humans' information processing differs from how algorithms operate. It offers fresh insights into how during a pandemic, older adults-a vulnerable demographic segment-interact with online information and misinformation. On the methodological front, the paper represents an intersection of two very disparate paradigms-ML techniques and interview data analyzed using thematic analysis and concepts drawn from grounded theory to enrich the scholarly understanding of human interaction with cutting-edge technologies.", "We provide explanations on the general principles of machine learning, as well as analytical steps required for successful machine learning-based predictive modeling, which is the focus of this series. In particular, we define the terms machine learning, artificial intelligence, as well as supervised and unsupervised learning, continuing by introducing optimization, thus, the minimization of an objective error function as the central dogma of machine learning. In addition, we discuss why it is important to separate predictive and explanatory modeling, and most importantly state that a prediction model should not be used to make inferences. Lastly, we broadly describe a classical workflow for training a machine learning model, starting with data pre-processing and feature engineering and selection, continuing on with a training structure consisting of a resampling method, hyperparameter tuning, and model selection, and ending with evaluation of model discrimination and calibration as well as robust internal or external validation of the fully developed model. Methodological rigor and clarity as well as understanding of the underlying reasoning of the internal workings of a machine learning approach are required, otherwise predictive applications despite being strong analytical tools are not well accepted into the clinical routine.", "Advanced parental age at offspring birth has been associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The objective of the current study was to investigate associations between parental age at birth and autism severity. The Rhode Island Consortium for Autism Research and Treatment (RI-CART) study represents a community-based sample with a range of autism severity, including participants with and without ASD. This study involved participants (n\u00a0=\u00a01178) enrolled in RI-CART with available mother and father ages at birth. Primary data points included the age of mother and father at the participant's birth and results from the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule - Second Edition (ADOS-2). Mothers were 1.7\u2009years older at the time of birth of the child with ASD, as compared to mothers of offspring without ASD. Fathers of children with ASD were 1.6\u2009years older at the time of birth than fathers of children without ASD. The age of both parents at offspring birth displayed a positive, statistically significant association with overall ASD severity and the severity of restricted/repetitive behaviors. This finding was driven by the association between parental age and the severity of compulsions or rituals. Intelligence and adaptive functioning did not moderate the relationship between parental age and ASD severity. This study extends prior research to show that advanced parental age at birth is associated with the severity as well as the presence of ASD in offspring.", "Can workflow during IVF be facilitated by artificial intelligence to limit monitoring during ovarian stimulation to a single day and enable level-loading of retrievals?\nThe dataset consisted of 1591 autologous cycles in unique patients with complete data including age, FSH, oestradiol and anti-M\u00fcllerian concentrations, follicle counts and body mass index. Observations during ovarian stimulation included oestradiol concentrations and follicle diameters. An algorithm was designed to identify the single best day for monitoring and predict trigger day options and total number of oocytes retrieved.\nThe mean error to predict the single best day for monitoring was 1.355 days. After identifying the single best day for evaluation, the algorithm identified the trigger date and range of three oocyte retrieval days specified by the earliest and the latest day on which the number of oocytes retrieved was minimally changed with a variance of 0-3 oocytes. Accuracy for prediction of total number of oocytes with baseline testing alone or in combination with data on the day of observation was 0.76 and 0.80, respectively. The sensitivities for estimating the total number and number of mature oocytes based solely on pre-IVF profiles in group I (0-10) were 0.76 and 0.78, and in group II (>10) 0.76 and 0.81, respectively.\nA first-iteration algorithm is described designed to improve workflow, minimize visits and level-load embryology work. This algorithm enables decisions at three interrelated nodal points for IVF workflow management to include monitoring on the single best day, assign trigger days to enable a range of 3 days for level-loading and estimate oocyte number.", "A software platform for AI-ECG algorithm research is designed and implemented to better serve the research of ECG artificial intelligence classification algorithm and to solve the problem of subjects data information management.

Artificial intelligence facilitates automatization of analytical modelling and contributes to prediction, diagnostics and treatment of diseases. This article presents an overview of the application of artificial intelligence in dementia research.\nMachine learning and its branch Deep Learning are widely used in research to support in diagnosis and prediction of dementia. Deep Learning models in certain tasks often result in better accuracy of detection and prediction of dementia than traditional machine learning methods, but they are more costly in terms of run times and hardware requirements. Both machine learning and Deep Learning models have their own strengths and limitations. Currently, there are few datasets with limited data available to train machine learning models. There are very few commercial applications of machine learning in medical practice to date, mostly represented by mobile applications, which include questionnaires and psychometric assessments with limited machine learning data processing.\nApplication of machine learning technologies in detection and prediction of dementia may provide an advantage to psychiatry and neurology by promoting a better understanding of the nature of the disease and more accurate evidence-based processes that are reproducible and standardized.", "Natural language processing (NLP), a domain of artificial intelligence (AI) that models human language, has been used in medicine to automate diagnostics, detect adverse events, support decision making and predict clinical outcomes. However, applications to the clinical neurosciences appear to be limited. NLP has matured with the implementation of deep transformer models (e.g., XLNet, BERT, T5, and RoBERTa) and transfer learning. The objectives of this study were to (1) systematically review NLP applications in the clinical neurosciences, and (2) explore NLP analysis to facilitate literature synthesis, providing clear examples to demonstrate the potential capabilities of these technologies for a clinical audience. Our NLP analysis consisted of keyword identification, text summarization and document classification. A total of 48 articles met inclusion criteria. NLP has been applied in the clinical neurosciences to facilitate literature synthesis, data extraction, patient identification, automated clinical reporting and outcome prediction. The number of publications applying NLP has increased rapidly over the past five\u00a0years. Document classifiers trained to differentiate included and excluded articles demonstrated moderate performance (XLNet AUC\u00a0=\u00a00.66, BERT AUC\u00a0=\u00a00.59, RoBERTa AUC\u00a0=\u00a00.62). The T5 transformer model generated acceptable abstract summaries. The application of NLP has the potential to enhance research and practice in the clinical neurosciences.", "Cognitive reserve provides evidence in the search for answers regarding the role that lifestyle has in the protection of cognition in old age. Through a structural equations model, different things were analyzed: the relative weight of education, occupational complexity, free time activities and the intelligence quotient in cognitive reserve; and its impact on three cognitive domains: memory, language and executive functions.\nA trail analysis was executed, using structural equations procedure.\n167 older participants (mean = 76.74\u2009years, standard deviation = 6.8\u2009years).\nParticipants were assessed with: Sociodemographic Questionnaire, Occupational Activity Agency Questionnaire, Social Participation Questionnaire and Neuropsychological Evaluation Battery for: memory, language and executive functions.\nThe cognitive reserve factor is well represented by the measures included, with values \u200b\u200bbetween .43 and .86, and shows a direct effect on language (\u03b2 = .52, p\u2009<\u2009.001), executive functions (\u03b2 = .77, p <.001), and memory (\u03b2 = .36, p\u2009=\u2009.003).\nIn conclusion, lifestyle factors, such as education, occupational complexity, leisure time activities and intelligence quotient have an impact on the conformation of cognitive reserve and performance in some psychological processes.", "Behavioral traits are rarely considered in task-evoked functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies, yet these traits can affect how an individual engages with the task, and thus lead to heterogeneity in task-evoked brain responses. We aimed to investigate whether interindividual variation in behavior associates with the accuracy of predicting task-evoked changes in the dynamics of functional brain connectivity measured with functional MRI. We developed a novel method called multi-timepoint pattern analysis (MTPA), in which binary logistic regression classifiers were trained to distinguish rest from each of 7 tasks (i.e., social cognition, working memory, language, relational, motor, gambling, emotion) based on functional connectivity dynamics measured in 1,000 healthy adults. We found that connectivity dynamics for multiple pairs of large-scale networks enabled individual classification between task and rest with accuracies exceeding 70%, with the most discriminatory connections relatively unique to each task. Crucially, interindividual variation in classification accuracy significantly associated with several behavioral, cognition and task performance measures. Classification between task and rest was generally more accurate for individuals with higher intelligence and task performance. Additionally, for some of the tasks, classification accuracy improved with lower perceived stress, lower aggression, higher alertness, and greater endurance. We conclude that heterogeneous dynamic adaptations of functional brain networks to changing cognitive demands can be reliably captured as linearly separable patterns by MTPA. Future studies should account for interindividual variation in behavior when investigating context-dependent dynamic functional connectivity.", "The recent advances and availability of computer hardware, software tools, and massive digital data archives have enabled the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) applications. Concerns over whether AI tools can \"communicate\" decisions to radiologists and primary care physicians is of particular importance because automated clinical decisions can substantially impact patient outcome. A challenge facing the clinical implementation of AI stems from the potential lack of trust clinicians have in these predictive models. This review will expand on the existing literature on interpretability methods for deep learning and review the state-of-the-art methods for predictive uncertainty estimation for computer-assisted segmentation tasks. Last, we discuss how uncertainty can improve predictive performance and model interpretability and can act as a tool to help foster trust. Keywords: Segmentation, Quantification, Ethics, Bayesian Network (BN) \u00a9 RSNA, 2021.", "The hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) niche is a specialized microenvironment, where a complex and dynamic network of interactions across multiple cell types regulates HSC function. During the last years, it became progressively clearer that changes in the HSC niche are responsible for specific alterations of HSC behavior. The aging of the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment has been shown to critically contribute to the decline in HSC function over time. Interestingly, while upon aging some niche structures within the BM are degenerated and negatively affect HSC functionality, other niche cells and specific signals are preserved and essential to retaining HSC function and regenerative capacity. These new findings on the role of the aging BM niche critically depend on the implementation of new technical tools, developed thanks to transdisciplinary approaches, which bring together different scientific fields. For example, the development of specific mouse models in addition to coculture systems, new 3D-imaging tools, ossicles, and ex-vivo BM mimicking systems is highlighting the importance of new technologies to unravel the complexity of the BM niche on aging. Of note, an exponential impact in the understanding of this biological system has been recently brought by single-cell sequencing techniques, spatial transcriptomics, and implementation of artificial intelligence and deep learning approaches to data analysis and integration. This review focuses on how the aging of the BM niche affects HSCs and on the new tools to investigate the specific alterations occurring in the BM upon aging. All these new advances in the understanding of the BM niche and its regulatory function on HSCs have the potential to lead to novel therapeutical approaches to preserve HSC function upon aging and disease.", "The purpose of this study is to explore the application value of artificial intelligence algorithm in multimodal MRI image diagnosis of cervical cancer. Based on the traditional convolutional neural network (CNN), an artificial intelligence 3D-CNN algorithm is designed according to the characteristics of cervical cancer. 70 patients with cervical cancer were selected as the experimental group, and 10 healthy people were selected as the reference group. The 3D-CNN algorithm was applied to the diagnosis of clinical cervical cancer multimodal MRI images. The value of the algorithm was comprehensively evaluated by the image quality and diagnostic accuracy. The results showed that compared with the traditional CNN algorithm, the convergence rate of the loss curve of the artificial intelligence 3D-CNN algorithm was accelerated, and the segmentation accuracy of whole-area tumors (WT), core tumor areas (CT), and enhanced tumor areas (ET) was significantly improved. In addition, the clarity of the multimodal MRI image and the recognition performance of the lesion were significantly improved. Under the artificial intelligence 3D-CNN algorithm, the Dice values of WT, ET, and CT regions were 0.78, 0.71, and 0.64, respectively. The sensitivity values were 0.92, 0.91, and 0.88, respectively. The specificity values were 0.93, 0.92, and 0.9\u2009l, respectively. The Hausdorff (Haus) distances were 0.93, 0.92, and 0.90, respectively. The data of various indicators were significantly better than those of the traditional CNN algorithm (P\u2009<\u20090.05). In addition, the diagnostic accuracy of the artificial intelligence 3D-CNN algorithm was 93.11\u2009\u00b1\u20094.65%, which was also significantly higher than that of the traditional CNN algorithm (82.45\u2009\u00b1\u20097.54%) (P\u2009<\u20090.05). In summary, the recognition and segmentation ability of multimodal MRI images based on artificial intelligence 3D-CNN algorithm for cervical cancer lesions were significantly improved, which can significantly enhance the clinical diagnosis rate of cervical cancer.", "The purpose of this article is to perform in-depth research and analysis on the artificial intelligence coordination and optimization mechanism of college counseling student management using big data technology. This study places the collaborative ideological and political work of colleges and universities in the context of big data, and by analyzing its basic connotation and changes in the real situation, it explores the development progression of colleges and universities making full use of big data resources to cultivate a collaborative education model, which is conducive to promoting colleges and universities to cultivate a whole staff, whole process, and all-round accurate ideological education and value-led services and to shape excellent young college students with comprehensive growth.

MRI has an established role in diagnosis of PCa through guiding biopsies. Due to multistep complex nature of the MRI-guided PCa diagnosis pathway, diagnostic performance has a big variation. Developing artificial intelligence (AI) models using machine learning, particularly deep learning, has an expanding role in radiology. Specifically, for prostate MRI, several AI approaches have been defined in the literature for prostate segmentation, lesion detection and classification with the aim of improving diagnostic performance and interobserver agreement. In this review article, we summarize the use of radiology applications of AI in prostate MRI.", "This study aims to investigate the relationship between mindset and impostor phenomenon, via the explanatory role of fear of failure and goal orientation in the work domain. Only one known study has previously connected mindset and impostor phenomenon in the scientific literature among females in a university setting. Data was collected from 201 working adults, with a roughly equal male-female ratio, from a range of sectors in the United Kingdom, Ireland, and United States. Participants completed an online survey comprising the Implicit Theories of Intelligence Scale, the Performance Failure Appraisal Inventory, Work Domain Goal Orientation Instrument, and the Clance Impostor Phenomenon Scale (CIPS). We tested a serial-parallel mediation model using structural equation modeling. The results suggest that people with a fixed mindset tend to experience more impostor phenomenon at work and this relationship is predominantly explained by their fear of failure. Further, when employees are also motivated by a performance avoid goal orientation, the relationship increases in strength. This indirect relationship suggests that staff training, and coaching interventions designed to increase people's belief that they can develop their abilities results in a reduction of their fear of failure and in their motivation to want to avoid showing their inability at work. The results also suggest cultivating environments that promote a growth mindset and learning goal orientation, alongside the safety to fail, could lessen the negative effects of having a fixed mindset, reduce fear of failure, and alleviate impostor phenomenon's negative impact on employee career development and wellbeing.", "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD).\n2018.\nThe Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring Network is an active surveillance program that estimates ASD prevalence and monitors timing of ASD identification among children aged 4 and 8 years. This report focuses on children aged 4 years in 2018, who were born in 2014 and had a parent or guardian who lived in the surveillance area in one of 11 sites (Arizona, Arkansas, California, Georgia, Maryland, Minnesota, Missouri, New Jersey, Tennessee, Utah, and Wisconsin) at any time during 2018. Children were classified as having ASD if they ever received 1) an ASD diagnostic statement (diagnosis) in an evaluation, 2) a special education classification of ASD (eligibility), or 3) an ASD International Classification of Diseases (ICD) code. Suspected ASD also was tracked among children aged 4 years. Children who did not meet the case definition for ASD were classified as having suspected ASD if their records contained a qualified professional's statement indicating a suspicion of ASD.\nFor 2018, the overall ASD prevalence was 17.0 per 1,000 (one in 59) children aged 4 years. Prevalence varied from 9.1 per 1,000 in Utah to 41.6 per 1,000 in California. At every site, prevalence was higher among boys than girls, with an overall male-to-female prevalence ratio of 3.4. Prevalence of ASD among children aged 4 years was lower among non-Hispanic White (White) children (12.9 per 1,000) than among non-Hispanic Black (Black) children (16.6 per 1,000), Hispanic children (21.1 per 1,000), and Asian/Pacific Islander (A/PI) children (22.7 per 1,000). Among children aged 4 years with ASD and information on intellectual ability, 52% met the surveillance case definition of co-occurring intellectual disability (intelligence quotient \u226470 or an examiner's statement of intellectual disability documented in an evaluation). Of children aged 4 years with ASD, 72% had a first evaluation at age \u226436 months. Stratified by census-tract-level median household income (MHI) tertile, a lower percentage of children with ASD and intellectual disability was evaluated by age 36 months in the low MHI tertile (72%) than in the high MHI tertile (84%). Cumulative incidence of ASD diagnosis or eligibility received by age 48 months was 1.5 times as high among children aged 4 years (13.6 per 1,000 children born in 2014) as among those aged 8 years (8.9 per 1,000 children born in 2010). Across MHI tertiles, higher cumulative incidence of ASD diagnosis or eligibility received by age 48 months was associated with lower MHI. Suspected ASD prevalence was 2.6 per 1,000 children aged 4 years, meaning for every six children with ASD, one child had suspected ASD. The combined prevalence of ASD and suspected ASD (19.7 per 1,000 children aged 4 years) was lower than ASD prevalence among children aged 8 years (23.0 per 1,000 children aged 8 years).\nGroups with historically lower prevalence of ASD (non-White and lower MHI) had higher prevalence and cumulative incidence of ASD among children aged 4 years in 2018, suggesting progress in identification among these groups. However, a lower percentage of children with ASD and intellectual disability in the low MHI tertile were evaluated by age 36 months than in the high MHI group, indicating disparity in timely evaluation. Children aged 4 years had a higher cumulative incidence of diagnosis or eligibility by age 48 months compared with children aged 8 years, indicating improvement in early identification of ASD. The overall prevalence for children aged 4 years was less than children aged 8 years, even when prevalence of children suspected of having ASD by age 4 years is included. This finding suggests that many children identified after age 4 years do not have suspected ASD documented by age 48 months.\nChildren born in 2014 were more likely to be identified with ASD by age 48 months than children born in 2010, indicating increased early identification. However, ASD identification among children aged 4 years varied by site, suggesting opportunities to examine developmental screening and diagnostic practices that promote earlier identification. Children aged 4 years also were more likely to have co-occurring intellectual disability than children aged 8 years, suggesting that improvement in the early identification and evaluation of developmental concerns outside of cognitive impairments is still needed. Improving early identification of ASD could lead to earlier receipt of evidence-based interventions and potentially improve developmental outcomes.", "What are the key considerations for developing an enhanced transcriptomic method for secretory endometrial tissue dating?\nMultiple gene expression signature combinations can serve as biomarkers for endometrial dating, but their predictive performance is variable and depends on the number and identity of the genes included in the prediction model, the dataset characteristics and the technology employed for measuring gene expression.\nAmong the new generation of transcriptomic endometrial dating (TED) tools developed in the last decade, there exists variation in the technology used for measuring gene expression, the gene makeup and the prediction model design. A detailed study, comparing prediction performance across signatures for understanding signature behaviour and discrepancies in gene content between them, is lacking.\nA multicentre prospective study was performed between July 2018 and October 2020 at five different centres from the same group of clinics (Spain). This study recruited 281 patients and finally included in the gene expression analysis 225 Caucasian patients who underwent IVF treatment. After preprocessing and batch effect filtering, gene expression measurements from 217 patients were combined with artificial intelligence algorithms (support vector machine, random forest and k-nearest neighbours) allowing evaluation of different prediction models. In addition, secretory-phase endometrial transcriptomes from gene expression omnibus (GEO) datasets were analysed for 137 women, to study the endometrial dating capacity of genes independently and grouped by signatures. This provided data on the consistency of prediction across different gene expression technologies and datasets.\nEndometrial biopsies were analysed using a targeted TruSeq (Illumina) custom RNA expression panel called the endometrial dating panel (ED panel). This panel included 301 genes previously considered relevant for endometrial dating as well as new genes selected for their anticipated value in detecting the secretory phase. Final samples (n = 217) were divided into a training set for signature discovery and an independent testing set for evaluation of predictive performance of the new signature. In addition, secretory-phase endometrial transcriptomes from GEO were analysed for 137 women to study endometrial dating capacity of genes independently and grouped by signatures. Predictive performance among these signatures was compared according to signature gene set size.\nTesting of the ED panel allowed development of a model based on a new signature of 73 genes, which we termed 'TED' and delivers an enhanced tool for the consistent dating of the secretory phase progression, especially during the mid-secretory endometrium (3-8 days after progesterone (P) administration (P + 3-P + 8) in a hormone replacement therapy cycle). This new model showed the best predictive capacity in an independent test set for staging the endometrial tissue in the secretory phase, especially in the expected window of implantation (average of 114.5 \u00b1 7.2 h of progesterone administered; range in our patient population of 82-172 h). Published sets of genes, in current use for endometrial dating and the new TED genes, were evaluated in parallel in whole-transcriptome datasets and in the ED panel dataset. TED signature performance was consistently excellent for all datasets assessed, frequently outperforming previously published sets of genes with a smaller number of genes for dating the endometrium in the secretory phase. Thus, this optimized set exhibited prediction consistency across datasets.\nThe data used in this study is partially available at GEO database. GEO identifiers GSE4888, GSE29981, GSE58144, GSE98386.\nAlthough dating the endometrial biopsy is crucial for investigating endometrial progression and the receptivity process, further studies are needed to confirm whether or not endometrial dating methods in general are clinically useful and to guide the specific use of TED in the clinical setting.\nMultiple gene signature combinations provide adequate endometrial dating, but their predictive performance depends on the identity of the genes included, the gene expression platform, the algorithms used and dataset characteristics. TED is a next-generation endometrial assessment tool based on gene expression for accurate endometrial progression dating especially during the mid-secretory.\nResearch funded by IVI Foundation (1810-FIVI-066-PD).

In this study, 18 patients with pregnancy complicated with brain tumor confirmed by pathology were selected as the research object. Ultrasound contrast based on artificial bee colony algorithm was performed and diagnosed by experienced clinicians. Ultrasonic image will be reconstructed by artificial bee colony algorithm to improve its image display ability. The pathological diagnosis will be handed over to the physiological pathology laboratory of the hospital for diagnosis. The doctor's ultrasonic diagnosis results were compared with the pathological diagnosis stage results of patients, and the results were analyzed by statistical analysis to evaluate its diagnostic value. The comparison results showed that the number and classification of benign tumors were the same, while in malignant tumors, the number diagnosis was the same, but there was one patient with diagnostic error in classification. One case of mixed glial neuron tumor was diagnosed as glial neuron tumor, and the diagnostic accuracy was 94.44% and the K value was 0.988. The diagnostic results of the two were in excellent agreement. The results show that, in the ultrasonic image diagnosis of patients with brain tumors during pregnancy based on artificial intelligence algorithm, most of them are benign and have obvious symptoms. Ultrasound has a good diagnostic accuracy and can be popularized in clinical diagnosis. The results can provide experimental data for the clinical application of ultrasonic image feature analysis based on artificial intelligence as the diagnosis of pregnancy complicated with brain tumors.", "Decision curve analysis is an increasingly popular method to assess the impact of a prediction model on medical decision making.

The corresponding R code is provided.", "Scientists rely more and more upon computerized data mining and artificial intelligence to analyze data sets and identify association rules, which serve as the basis of evolving theories. This tendency is likely to expand, and computerized intelligence is likely to take a leading role in scientific theorizing. While the ever-advancing technology could be of great benefit, scientists with expertise in many research fields do not necessarily understand thoroughly enough the various assumptions, which underlie different data mining methods and which pose significant limitations on the association rules that could be identified in the first place. There seems to be a need for a comprehensive framework, which should present the various possible technological aids in the context of our neurocognitive process of theorizing and identifying association rules. Such a framework can be hopefully used to understand, identify, and overcome the limitations of the currently fragmented processes of technology-based theorizing and the formation of association rules in any research field. In order to meet this end, we divide theorizing into underlying neurocognitive components, describe their current technological expansions and limitations, and offer a possible comprehensive computational framework for each such component and their combination.", "The democratization of machine learning (ML) through availability of open-source learning libraries, the availability of datasets in the \"big data\" era, increasing computing power even on mobile devices, and online training resources have both led to an explosion in applications and publications of ML in the clinical neurosciences, but has also enabled a dangerous amount of flawed analyses and cardinal methodological errors committed by benevolent authors. While powerful ML methods are nowadays available to almost anyone and can be applied after just few minutes of familiarizing oneself with these methods, that does not imply that one has mastered these techniques. This textbook for clinicians aims to demystify ML by illustrating its methodological foundations, as well as some specific applications throughout clinical neuroscience, and its limitations. While our mind can recognize, abstract, and deal with the many uncertainties in clinical practice, algorithms cannot. Algorithms must remain tools of our own mind, tools that we should be able to master, control, and apply to our advantage in an adjunctive manner. Our hope is that this book inspires and instructs physician-scientists to continue to develop the seeds that have been planted for machine intelligence in clinical neuroscience, not forgetting their inherent limitations.", "Background: While normal ranges for 99mTc thyroid percentage uptake vary, the seemingly intuitive evaluation of thyroid function does not reflect the complexity of thyroid pathology and biochemical status. The emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) in nuclear medicine has driven problem solving associated with logic and reasoning that warrant re-examination of established benchmarks in thyroid functional assessment. Methods: There were 123 patients retrospectively analysed in the study sample comparing scintigraphic findings to grounded truth established through biochemistry status. Conventional statistical approaches were used in conjunction with an artificial neural network (ANN) to determine predictors of thyroid function from data features. A convolutional neural network (CNN) was also used to extract features from the input tensor (images). Results: Analysis was confounded by sub-clinical hyperthyroidism, primary hypothyroidism, sub-clinical hypothyroidism and T3 toxicosis. Binary accuracy for identifying hyperthyroidism was highest for thyroid uptake classification using a threshold of 4.5% (82.6%), followed by pooled physician 6interpretation with the aid of uptake values (82.3%). Visual evaluation without quantitative values reduced accuracy to 61.0% for pooled physician determinations and 61.4% classifying on the basis of thyroid gland intensity relative to salivary glands. The machine learning (ML) algorithm produced 84.6% accuracy, however, this included biochemistry features not available to the semantic analysis. The deep learning (DL) algorithm had an accuracy of 80.5% based on image inputs alone. Conclusion: Thyroid scintigraphy is useful in identifying hyperthyroid patients suitable for radioiodine therapy when using an appropriately validated cut-off for the patient population (4.5% in this population). ML ANN algorithms can be developed to improve accuracy as second readers systems when biochemistry results are available. DL CNN algorithms can be developed to improve accuracy in the absence of biochemistry results. ML and DL do not displace the role of the physician in thyroid scintigraphy but could be used as second reader systems to minimize errors and increase confidence.", "Forensic Science South Australia (FSSA) has been using STRmix\u2122 software to deconvolute all reported DNA mixtures since 2012. Almost a decade of deconvolutions had led to a substantial repository of analysed profile data that can be interrogated to observe trends in case type, location or occurrence. In addition, deconvolutions can be compared in order to identify common DNA donors and reveal new intelligence information in cases where DNA profiling has previously provided no investigative information. As a proof of concept all samples deconvoluted as part of criminal casework (suspect or no-suspect) were interrogated and compared to each other using the mixture-to-mixture comparison feature in STRmix\u2122. Within the Adelaide region there were 32 groups of cases that had evidence samples linked by a common DNA donor with LR >\u00a01 million which was in addition to direct links and mixture searching links identified previously. These groups of cases can then be interrogated to reveal additional information to inform Police intelligence gathering. Our paper reports on the findings of this proof-of-concept study.", "The advancement of computing and technology has invaded all the dimensions of science. Artificial intelligence (AI) is one core branch of Computer Science, which has percolated to all the arenas of science and technology, from core engineering to medicines. Thus, AI has found its way for application in the field of medicinal chemistry and heath care. The conventional methods of drug design have been replaced by computer-aided designs of drugs in recent times. AI is being used extensively to improve the design techniques and required time of the drugs. Additionally, the target proteins can be conveniently identified using AI, which enhances the success rate of the designed drug. The AI technology is used in each step of the drug designing procedure, which decreases the health hazards related to preclinical trials and also reduces the cost substantially. The AI is an effective tool for data mining based on the huge pharmacological data and machine learning process. Hence, AI has been used in de novo drug design, activity scoring, virtual screening and in silico evaluation in the properties (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity) of a drug molecule. Various pharmaceutical companies have teamed up with AI companies for faster progress in the field of drug development, along with the healthcare system. The review covers various aspects of AI (Machine learning, Deep learning, Artificial neural networks) in drug design. It also provides a brief overview of the recent progress by the pharmaceutical companies in drug discovery by associating with different AI companies.", "Judging in competitive sports is prone to errors arising from the inherent limitations to humans' cognitive and sensorial capabilities and from various potential sources of bias that influence judges. Artistic gymnastics offers a case in point: given the complexity of scoring and the ever-increasing speed of athletes' performance, systems powered by artificial intelligence (AI) seem to promise benefits for the judging process and its outcomes. To characterize today's human judging process for artistic gymnastics and examine contrasts against an AI-powered system currently being introduced in this context, an in-depth case study analyzed interview data from various stakeholder groups (judges, gymnasts, coaches, federations, technology providers, and fans). This exploratory study unearthed several paradoxical tensions accompanying AI-based evaluations in this setting. The paper identifies and illustrates tensions of this nature related to AI-powered systems' accuracy, objectivity, explainability, relationship with artistry, interaction with humans, and consistency.", "When new technology is introduced into healthcare, novel ethical dilemmas arise in the human-machine interface. As artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML) and big data can exhaust human oversight and memory capacity, this will give rise to many of these new dilemmas.Technology has little if any ethical status but is inevitably interwoven with human activity and thus may serve to allow qualitative and quantitative disruption of human performance and interaction. We argue that personal integrity, justice of resource allocation and accountability of moral agency comprise three themes that characterize ethical dilemmas that arise with development and application of AI. These themes are important to address in parallel to further evolution of AI in health care for ethical practice of healthcare.", "Exponential development in artificial intelligence or deep learning technology has resulted in more trials to systematically determine the pathological diagnoses using whole slide images (WSIs) in clinical and nonclinical studies. In this study, we applied Mask Regions with Convolution Neural Network (Mask R-CNN), a deep learning model that uses instance segmentation, to detect hepatic fibrosis induced by N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) in Sprague-Dawley rats. From 51 WSIs, we collected 2011 cropped images with hepatic fibrosis annotations. Training and detection of hepatic fibrosis via artificial intelligence methods was performed using Tensorflow 2.1.0, powered by an NVIDIA 2080 Ti GPU. From the test process using tile images, 95% of model accuracy was verified. In addition, we validated the model to determine whether the predictions by the trained model can reflect the scoring system by the pathologists at the WSI level. The validation was conducted by comparing the model predictions in 18 WSIs at 20\u00d7 and 10\u00d7 magnifications with ground truth annotations and board-certified pathologists. Predictions at 20\u00d7 showed a high correlation with ground truth (R2 = 0.9660) and a good correlation with the average fibrosis rank by pathologists (R2 = 0.8887). Therefore, the Mask R-CNN algorithm is a useful tool for detecting and quantifying pathological findings in nonclinical studies.", "To prospectively investigate the association between personal activity intelligence (PAI) - a novel metabolic metric which translates heart rate during physical activity into a simple weekly score - and mortality in relatively healthy participants in China whose levels and patterns of physical activity in addition to other lifestyle factors are different from those in high-income countries.\nFrom the population-based China Kadoorie Biobank study, 443,792 healthy adults were recruited between June 2004 and July 2008. Participant's weekly PAI score was estimated and divided into four groups (PAI scores of 0, \u226450, 51-99, or \u2265100). Using Cox proportional hazard analyses, we calculated adjusted hazard ratios (AHRs) for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and all-cause mortality related to PAI scores.\nDuring a median follow-up of 8.2 (interquartile range, 7.3 to 9.1) years, there were 21,901 deaths, including 9466 CVD deaths. Compared with the inactive group (0 PAI score), a baseline weekly PAI score greater than or equal to 100 was associated with a lower risk of CVD mortality, an AHR of 0.87 (95% CI, 0.81 to 0.94) in men, and an AHR of 0.84 (95% CI, 0.78 to 0.92) in women, after adjusting for multiple confounders. Participants with a weekly PAI score greater than or equal to 100 also had a lower risk of all-cause mortality (AHR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.89 to 0.97 in men, and AHR, 0.93; 95%, 0.88 to 0.98 in women). Moreover, this subgroup gained 2.7 (95% CI, 2.4 to 3.0) years of life, compared with the inactive cohort.\nAmong relatively healthy Chinese adults, the PAI metric was inversely associated with CVD and all-cause mortality, highlighting the generalizability of the score in different races, ethnicities, and socioeconomic strata.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning (DL) remains a hot topic in medicine. DL is a subcategory of machine learning that takes advantage of multiple layers of interconnected neurons capable of analyzing immense amounts of data and \"learning\" patterns and offering predictions. It appears to be poised to fundamentally transform and help advance the field of diagnostic radiology, as heralded by numerous published use cases and number of FDA-cleared products. On the other hand, while multiple publications have touched upon many great hypothetical use cases of AI in interventional radiology (IR), the actual implementation of AI in IR clinical practice has been slow compared with the diagnostic world. In this article, we set out to examine a few challenges contributing to this scarcity of AI applications in IR, including inherent specialty challenges, regulatory hurdles, intellectual property, raising capital, and ethics. Owing to the complexities involved in implementing AI in IR, it is likely that IR will be one of the late beneficiaries of AI. In the meantime, it would be worthwhile to continuously engage in defining clinically relevant use cases and focus our limited resources on those that would benefit our patients the most.", "Molecular modeling in pharmacology is a promising emerging tool for exploring drug interactions with cellular components. Recent advances in molecular simulations, big data analysis, and artificial intelligence (AI) have opened new opportunities for rationalizing drug interactions with their pharmacological targets. Despite the obvious utility and increasing impact of computational approaches, their development is not progressing at the same speed in different fields of pharmacology. Here, we review current in silico techniques used in cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), cardiological drug discovery, and assessment of cardiotoxicity. In silico techniques are paving the way to a new era in cardiovascular medicine, but their use somewhat lags behind that in other fields.", "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) continues to present major challenges to modern healthcare. Recent advances in whole-genome sequencing (WGS) have made the rapid molecular characterization of AMR a realistic possibility for diagnostic laboratories; yet major barriers to clinical implementation exist.\nWe describe and compare short- and long-read sequencing platforms, typical components of bioinformatics pipelines, tools for AMR gene detection and the relative merits of read- or assembly-based approaches. The challenges of characterizing mobile genetic elements from genomic data are outlined, as well as the complexities inherent to the prediction of phenotypic resistance from WGS. Practical obstacles to implementation in diagnostic laboratories, the critical role of quality control and external quality assurance, as well as standardized reporting standards are also discussed. Future directions, such as the application of machine-learning and artificial intelligence algorithms, linked to clinically meaningful outcomes, may offer a new paradigm for the clinical application of AMR prediction.\nAMR prediction from WGS data presents an exciting opportunity to advance our capacity to comprehensively characterize infectious pathogens in a rapid manner, ultimately aiming to improve patient outcomes. Collaborative efforts between clinicians, scientists, regulatory bodies and healthcare administrators will be critical to achieve the full promise of this approach.", "In December 2019, we ran Pacific Eclipse, a pandemic tabletop exercise using smallpox originating in Fiji as a case study. Pacific Eclipse brought together international stakeholders from health, defence, law enforcement, emergency management and a range of other organisations.\nTo review potential gaps in preparedness and identify modifiable factors which could prevent a pandemic or mitigate the impact of a pandemic.\nPacific Eclipse was held on December 9-10 in Washington DC, Phoenix and Honolulu simultaneously. The scenario began in Fiji and becomes a pandemic. Mathematical modelling of smallpox transmission was used to simulate the epidemic under different conditions and to test the effect of interventions. Live polling, using Poll Everywhere software\u00a0that participants downloaded onto their smart phones, was used to gather participant decisions as the scenario unfolded. Stakeholders from state and federal government and non-government organisations from The United States, The United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, as well as industry and non-government organisations attended.\nThe scenario progressed in three phases and participants were able to make decisions during each phase using live polling. The polling showed very diverse and sometimes conflicting decision making. Factors influential to pandemic severity were identified and categorised as modifiable or unmodifiable. A series of recommendations were made on the modifiable determinants of pandemic severity and how these can be incorporated into pandemic planning. These included preventing an attack through intelligence, law enforcement and legislation, improved speed of diagnosis, speed and completeness of case finding and case isolation, speed and security of vaccination response (including stockpiling), speed and completeness of contact tracing, protecting critical infrastructure and business continuity, non-pharmaceutical interventions (social distancing, PPE, border control) and protecting first responders.\nPacific Eclipse illustrated the impact of a pandemic of smallpox under different response scenarios, which were validated to some extent by the COVID-19 pandemic. The framework developed from the scenario draws out modifiable determinants of pandemic severity which can inform pandemic planning for the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and for future pandemics.", "To assess whether an electrocardiography-based artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm developed to detect severe ventricular dysfunction (left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF] of 35% or below) independently predicts long-term mortality after cardiac surgery among patients without severe ventricular dysfunction (LVEF>35%).\nPatients who underwent valve or coronary bypass surgery at Mayo Clinic (1993-2019) and had documented LVEF above 35% on baseline electrocardiography were included. We compared patients with an abnormal vs a normal AI-enhanced electrocardiogram (AI-ECG) screen for LVEF of 35% or below on preoperative electrocardiography. The primary end point was all-cause mortality.\nA total of 20,627 patients were included, of whom 17,125 (83.0%) had a normal AI-ECG screen and 3502 (17.0%) had an abnormal AI-ECG screen. Patients with an abnormal AI-ECG screen were older and had more comorbidities. Probability of survival at 5 and 10 years was 86.2% and 68.2% in patients with a normal AI-ECG screen vs 71.4% and 45.1% in those with an abnormal screen (log-rank, P<.01). In the multivariate Cox survival analysis, the abnormal AI-ECG screen was independently associated with a higher all-cause mortality overall (hazard ratio [HR], 1.31; 95% CI, 1.24 to 1.37) and in subgroups of isolated valve surgery (HR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.18 to 1.42), isolated coronary artery bypass grafting (HR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.20 to 1.39), and combined coronary artery bypass grafting and valve surgery (HR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.08 to 1.32). In a subgroup analysis, the association between abnormal AI-ECG screen and mortality was consistent in patients with LVEF of 35% to 55% and among those with LVEF above 55%.\nA novel electrocardiography-based AI algorithm that predicts severe ventricular dysfunction can predict long-term mortality among patients with LVEF above 35% undergoing valve and/or coronary bypass surgery.", "The work presents the analysis and synthesis of patent families about leprosy worldwide in the last 20 years. Three technological aspects were defined for the study of both portfolios, thus defined: diagnostic, drug/treatment and vaccine. Three thousand and three hundred twenty-three (3323) patent families were identified (790 for diagnostic, 1515 for drug and 1018 for vaccine). Fifty-eight (58) patent holders were identified and analyzed, with the most expressive portfolio of patent families, distributed in 13 countries. For the recovery of patent families, the ORBIT Intelligence\u00ae system from QUESTEL\u00ae was used. Using quantitative and qualitative analysis and synthesis, the patterns of five strategic indicators on the global patent scenario about leprosy were observed, namely: holders of patent families; the years of filing for unionist priority for patent families; countries of unionist priority for patent families; the legal status of filed patent families; and the legal status of patent families by country of protection. It is suggested that new public policies be created to encourage synergy between patent families and the social determinants of neglected populations, in order to induce a safe path to technological independence and better performance in the fight against leprosy in the Brazil.", "In order to improve the level of education development in remote areas of China, help minority schools to better play the advantages of multimedia network teaching resources provided by the state, and further improve the level of multimedia network management, a multimedia network teaching management system is studied and developed. The teaching information and business process of the school is analyzed, the division of the structure of the film and television multimedia information management system is completed, and the overall structure, functional structure, and database of the system are designed; Tornado technology, NoSQL database technology, jQuery technology, and Ajax technology are used to complete the development of the system. The results show that the real system can provide a highly automated platform for the school multimedia network-teaching management. The system makes the teaching staff work more efficiently and accurately. The results show that the system studied has a significant effect on the multimedia teaching of minority films and television. Using the characteristics of the combination of pictures, text, sound, image, and shadow, the knowledge can be shown to students intuitively, which is helpful to relaxed and happy learning of students and stimulate their desire to learn. Multimedia teaching has become an important teaching assistant tool. This exploration can provide theoretical support for the design of the network teaching information management system based on artificial intelligence, decentralize the complex network environment, and carry out decentralized management.", "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the result of infection by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has caused a global pandemic. To respond to this outbreak rapidly and properly, clinical pharmacists in Shanghai Children's Hospital carried out innovative measures based on previous artificial intelligence experiences, such as using service robots for contactless drug delivery between Fever Clinic and Pharmacy Storage, providing telemedicine counseling on specific platforms and offering multimedia health education. With good control of the pandemic in Shanghai, these contactless services have been retained and expanded at the patients' request. The aim of this article is to share our strategies and efforts with peers who are fighting against COVID-19 in other countries and regions.", "Since the COVID-19 situation keeps going on started from 2019. Many solutions are to against the spreading of coronavirus disease. The nurses have died, and other medical workers are in critical condition from operating in the hospital. It is a deadly virus that kills many humans; Thailand's solutions have urged the public to be confident about the Government's handling of the 2019-novel Coronavirus. At the same time, everyone has to embrace the new normal lifestyle and social distancing while patiently waiting for scientists and doctors to discover vaccines and treatments to defeat COVID-19. This work proposes an innovation of wireless body temperature that instead of the used manual by medical workers in the hospital of \"the contactless body temperature monitoring (CBTM) of the in-patient department (IPD).\" The proposed CBTM implementation applied artificial intelligence and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies. The specified infrared body temperature on the MLX90614 DCI used for the medical field was selected to embed the IoT-CBTM for IPD using the IoT platform. The MLX90614 is an accurate sensor that matches to use for medical promotion. The detected information data from IPD will be sent to the host computer and stored in the cloud internet service at a microwave band frequency of 2.5/5.0\u00a0GHz. This paper presents the accuracy test of the IoT-CBTM prototype calibrated with the manual body temperature verifying device under Thai Industrial Institute to close with the accuracy standard requirement. The experiments were repeated many times until raise up over 70% to get more reliability accuracy. The findings indicated that the proposed prototype achieved a reliability calibration of 74.7%. The actual use of IoT-CBTM is convenient to the nurse, doctor, and medical workers to collect body temperature data into the host computer, and they can monitor this information at all times in the working room, which is far away from the COVID-19 patients. Therefore, this novel innovation was achieved because it took to try out at a local health-promoting hospital in Songkhla Province, Thailand, which the IoT-CBTM system was satisfied by the medical staff because it can safe their time, and genuinely reaching the new norm on medical distancing real-time monitoring.", "Simulation training provides a safe, non-judgmental environment where members of the multi-professional team can practice both their technical and non-technical skills. Poor teamwork and communication are recurring contributing factors to adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes. Simulation can improve outcomes and is now a compulsory part of the national training matrix. Components of successful training include involving the multi-professional team, high fidelity models, keeping training on-site, and focussing on human factors training; a key factor in adverse patient outcomes. The future of simulation training is an exciting field, with the advent of augmented reality devices and the use of artificial intelligence.", "BACKGROUND\u2002: The European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) has developed a core curriculum for high quality optical diagnosis training for practice across Europe. The development of easy-to-measure competence standards for optical diagnosis can optimize clinical decision-making in endoscopy. This manuscript represents an official Position Statement of the ESGE aiming to define simple, safe, and easy-to-measure competence standards for endoscopists and artificial intelligence systems performing optical diagnosis of diminutive colorectal polyps (1\u200a-\u200a5\u200amm). METHODS\u2002: A panel of European experts in optical diagnosis participated in a modified Delphi process to reach consensus on Simple Optical Diagnosis Accuracy (SODA) competence standards for implementation of the optical diagnosis strategy for diminutive colorectal polyps. In order to assess the clinical benefits and harms of implementing optical diagnosis with different competence standards, a systematic literature search was performed. This was complemented with the results from a recently performed simulation study that provides guidance for setting alternative competence standards for optical diagnosis. Proposed competence standards were based on literature search and simulation study results. Competence standards were accepted if at least 80\u200a% agreement was reached after a maximum of three voting rounds. RECOMMENDATION 1: \u2002In order to implement the leave-in-situ strategy for diminutive colorectal lesions (1-5\u200amm), it is clinically acceptable if, during real-time colonoscopy, at least 90\u200a% sensitivity and 80\u200a% specificity is achieved for high confidence endoscopic characterization of colorectal neoplasia of 1-5\u200amm in the rectosigmoid. Histopathology is used as the gold standard.Level of agreement 95\u200a%. RECOMMENDATION 2: \u2002In order to implement the resect-and-discard strategy for diminutive colorectal lesions (1-5\u200amm), it is clinically acceptable if, during real-time colonoscopy, at least 80\u200a% sensitivity and 80\u200a% specificity is achieved for high confidence endoscopic characterization of colorectal neoplasia of 1-5\u200amm. Histopathology is used as the gold standard.Level of agreement 100\u200a%. CONCLUSION\u2002: The developed SODA competence standards define diagnostic performance thresholds in relation to clinical consequences, for training and for use when auditing the optical diagnosis of diminutive colorectal polyps.", "Deep neural networks unlocked a vast range of new applications by solving tasks of which many were previously deemed as reserved to higher human intelligence. One of the developments enabling this success was a boost in computing power provided by special purpose hardware, such as graphic or tensor processing units. However, these do not leverage fundamental features of neural networks like parallelism and analog state variables. Instead, they emulate neural networks relying on binary computing, which results in unsustainable energy consumption and comparatively low speed. Fully parallel and analogue hardware promises to overcome these challenges, yet the impact of analogue neuron noise and its propagation, i.e. accumulation, threatens rendering such approaches inept. Here, we determine for the first time the propagation of noise in deep neural networks comprising noisy nonlinear neurons in trained fully connected layers. We study additive and multiplicative as well as correlated and uncorrelated noise, and develop analytical methods that predict the noise level in any layer of symmetric deep neural networks or deep neural networks trained with back propagation. We find that noise accumulation is generally bound, and adding additional network layers does not worsen the signal to noise ratio beyond a limit. Most importantly, noise accumulation can be suppressed entirely when neuron activation functions have a slope smaller than unity. We therefore developed the framework for noise in fully connected deep neural networks implemented in analog systems, and identify criteria allowing engineers to design noise-resilient novel neural network hardware.", "Behavioral impairment occurs in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and ALS-fronto-temporal dementia (ALS-FTD). It has been proposed that ALS patients without FTD retain an awareness of their behavioral impairment while ALS-FTD patients lose this awareness (referred to as retention vs. loss of \"insight\"). Loss of insight has not yet been studied across the entire ALS-FTD spectrum; our study addresses this gap by including patients with all the ALS cognitive-behavioral profiles.\nEighty-three ALS patients (and their informants) took part in this bicentric study involving two German recruitment sites. Patients and informants completed the Frontal Systems Behavior Scale covering the domains of apathy, disinhibition, and executive dysfunctioning. Patients were classified into five groups according to the Strong and Rascovsky criteria: cognitively unimpaired (ALSni), cognitively impaired without dementia (ALSci), behaviorally impaired (ALSbi), a combination of behaviorally and cognitively impaired (ALScbi), and ALS-FTD. We applied Bayesian two-way ANOVA to test whether there were subgroup differences regarding insight into their behavioral decline.\nAll patient subgroups experienced behavioral decline (Bayes factor\u00a0>\u00a03). Only ALS-FTD patients lost insight into disinhibition and executive dysfunctioning. ALSbi patients exhibited worse insight than ALSni and ALSci patients (Bayes factor\u00a0>\u00a010). Evidence regarding the ALScbi patients was inconclusive. Higher IQ was associated with worse insight (Bayes factor\u00a0>\u00a03).\nOur findings provide solid support for the notion that ALS patients without dementia experience behavioral decline regardless of their cognitive-behavioral profile and retain different levels of insight into this decline. The inverse association of premorbid verbal intelligence with insight was unexpected, leaving room for further investigation.", "In recent years, the learning efficacy of online to offline (O2O) teaching methods seems to outperform traditional teaching methods in the field of education. Students can use a small private online course (SPOC) teaching platform to preview class-related materials, learn basic knowledge, and enhance the practical experience of system development in offline courses. The research team applied an artificial intelligence (AI) precision education strategy to design a teaching experiment that evaluated whether this approach may lead to better learning outcomes. In addition to questionnaire surveys to ascertain students' attitudes toward and their satisfaction with learning, this study employed in-depth interviews to understand a potential influence on changes in teachers' curriculum design and teaching approaches when SPOCs was integrated into the traditional university classroom, as well as the impact of the AI precision education model. The results showed that the AI precision education model may facilitate students' learning experience and enhance student achievement.", "Diabetes mellitus has been an increasing concern owing to its high morbidity, and the average age of individual affected by of individual affected by this disease has now decreased to mid-twenties. Given the high prevalence, it is necessary to address with this problem effectively. Many researchers and doctors have now developed detection techniques based on artificial intelligence to better approach problems that are missed due to human errors. Data mining techniques with algorithms such as - density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise and ordering points to identify the cluster structure, the use of machine vision systems to learn data on facial images, gain better features for model training, and diagnosis via presentation of iridocyclitis for detection of the disease through iris patterns have been deployed by various practitioners. Machine learning classifiers such as support vector machines, logistic regression, and decision trees, have been comparative discussed various authors. Deep learning models such as artificial neural networks and recurrent neural networks have been considered, with primary focus on long short-term memory and convolutional neural network architectures in comparison with other machine learning models. Various parameters such as the root-mean-square error, mean absolute errors, area under curves, and graphs with varying criteria are commonly used. In this study, challenges pertaining to data inadequacy and model deployment are discussed. The future scope of such methods has also been discussed, and new methods are expected to enhance the performance of existing models, allowing them to attain greater insight into the conditions on which the prevalence of the disease depends.", "The applications of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) in modern medicine are growing exponentially, and new developments are fast-paced. However, the lack of trust and appropriate legislation hinder its clinical implementation. Recently, there is a clear increase of directives and considerations on Ethical AI. However, most literature broadly deals with ethical tensions on a meta-level without offering hands-on advice in practice. In this article, we non-exhaustively cover basic practical guidelines regarding AI-specific ethical aspects, including transparency and explicability, equity and mitigation of biases, and lastly, liability.", "Artificial Intelligence is gaining traction in medicine for its ease of use and advancements in technology. This study evaluates the current literature on the use of artificial intelligence in adult spinal deformity.", "Given the prolongation of the newly emerging COVID-19 pandemic and the significance of caring for the patients by nursing staff, investigating and planning for the different psychological dimensions of this group is of paramount importance. Hence, this study investigated the role of spiritual intelligence in predicting nurses' empathizing with COVID-19 patients.\nThis descriptive-correlation study was conducted in 2021 on nurses caring for COVID-19 patients in three public hospitals. The researchers used two standard questionnaires, including the Jefferson Scale of Empathy (JSE) and Spiritual Intelligence (SI), for data collection. The collected data were analyzed in SPSS16 using descriptive statistics and the following: The Mann-Whitney U test, Kruskal-Wallis test, Regression, chi-square test, and Pearson and Spearman correlations.\nThe statistical population consisted of 338 nurses with an average age of 34 and ten years of work experience. There was a significant positive relationship between the empathy scores and spiritual intelligence scores of the nurses caring for COVID-19 patients (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). It was also concluded from the regression analysis that, spiritual intelligence affect empathy. Mean score of empathy was higher in hospitals where more nursing staff had MSc degrees. There was a significant difference between the empathy scores of the three hospitals (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05).\nThe results indicated that there is a positive relationship between empathy and spiritual intelligence. Therefor improving spiritual intelligence is the appropriate strategy to ameliorate empathy during the COVID19 pandemic. At the same time, study indicated attention to the issue of nurses' mental health. Hence, it was suggested to incorporate these issues in the training programs and national/international decisions.", "Classical executive tasks, such as Wisconsin card-sorting and verbal fluency, are widely used as tests of frontal lobe control functions. Since the pioneering work of Shallice and Burgess (1991), it has been known that complex, naturalistic tasks can capture deficits that are missed in these classical tests. Matching this finding, deficits in several classical tasks are predicted by loss of fluid intelligence, linked to damage in a specific cortical \"multiple-demand\" (MD) network, while deficits in a more naturalistic task are not. To expand on these previous results, we examined the effect of focal brain lesions on three new tests-a modification of the previously-used Hotel task, a new test of task switching after extended delays, and a test of decision-making in imagined real-life scenarios. As potential predictors of impairment we measured volume of damage to a priori MD and default mode (DMN) networks, as well as cortical damage outside these networks. Deficits in the three new tasks were substantial, but were not explained by loss of fluid intelligence, or by volume of damage to either MD or DMN networks. Instead, deficits were associated with diverse lesions, and not strongly correlated with one another. The results confirm that naturalistic tasks capture cognitive deficits beyond those measured by fluid intelligence. We suggest, however, that these deficits may not arise from specific control operations required by complex behaviour. Instead, like everyday activities, complex tasks combine a rich variety of interacting cognitive components, bringing many opportunities for processing to be disturbed.", "The clinical deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) applications in medical imaging is perhaps the greatest challenge facing radiology in the next decade. One of the main obstacles to the incorporation of automated AI-based decision-making tools in medicine is the failure of models to generalize when deployed across institutions with heterogeneous populations and imaging protocols. The most well-understood pitfall in developing these AI models is overfitting, which has, in part, been overcome by optimizing training protocols. However, overfitting is not the only obstacle to the success and generalizability of AI. Underspecification is also a serious impediment that requires conceptual understanding and correction. It is well known that a single AI pipeline, with prescribed training and testing sets, can produce several models with various levels of generalizability. Underspecification defines the inability of the pipeline to identify whether these models have embedded the structure of the underlying system by using a test set independent of, but distributed identically, to the training set. An underspecified pipeline is unable to assess the degree to which the models will be generalizable. Stress testing is a known tool in AI that can limit underspecification and, importantly, assure broad generalizability of AI models. However, the application of stress tests is new in radiologic applications. This report describes the concept of underspecification from a radiologist perspective, discusses stress testing as a specific strategy to overcome underspecification, and explains how stress tests could be designed in radiology-by modifying medical images or stratifying testing datasets. In the upcoming years, stress tests should become in radiology the standard that crash tests have become in the automotive industry.

Innovative services have also been created through digital transformation, including an acceleration and deepening of artificial intelligence technology. Things that were once technically impossible are now possible. These innovative technologies will spread across various fields, and disaster response will not be an exception. The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare is promoting the use of personal health records in a way that effectively supports the management of treatments by using data from wearable devices and specific applications. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the trade-off between protecting personal information and enabling social benefits, such as in the use of digital tracking, and infodemics, including misinformation, have become new social challenges. Reviewing past disaster preparedness and the services and value provided by digital transformation indicates what new disaster preparedness should be. Digital transformation does not require literacy (ability to collect, analyze, and use information) but competence (beneficial behavioral traits derived from experience). Understanding behavior through data and enabling rational behavior are crucial. By increasing human productivity, we can save time and improve self- and mutual-help in times of disaster. Medical information and digital services must be properly used in normal times. A society that uses such services will be more disaster resilient.", "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD).\n2018.\nThe Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring (ADDM) Network conducts active surveillance of ASD. This report focuses on the prevalence and characteristics of ASD among children aged 8 years in 2018 whose parents or guardians lived in 11 ADDM Network sites in the United States (Arizona, Arkansas, California, Georgia, Maryland, Minnesota, Missouri, New Jersey, Tennessee, Utah, and Wisconsin). To ascertain ASD among children aged 8 years, ADDM Network staff review and abstract developmental evaluations and records from community medical and educational service providers. In 2018, children met the case definition if their records documented 1) an ASD diagnostic statement in an evaluation (diagnosis), 2) a special education classification of ASD (eligibility), or 3) an ASD International Classification of Diseases (ICD) code.\nFor 2018, across all 11 ADDM sites, ASD prevalence per 1,000 children aged 8 years ranged from 16.5 in Missouri to 38.9 in California. The overall ASD prevalence was 23.0 per 1,000 (one in 44) children aged 8 years, and ASD was 4.2 times as prevalent among boys as among girls. Overall ASD prevalence was similar across racial and ethnic groups, except American Indian/Alaska Native children had higher ASD prevalence than non-Hispanic White (White) children (29.0 versus 21.2 per 1,000 children aged 8 years). At multiple sites, Hispanic children had lower ASD prevalence than White children (Arizona, Arkansas, Georgia, and Utah), and non-Hispanic Black (Black) children (Georgia and Minnesota). The associations between ASD prevalence and neighborhood-level median household income varied by site. Among the 5,058 children who met the ASD case definition, 75.8% had a diagnostic statement of ASD in an evaluation, 18.8% had an ASD special education classification or eligibility and no ASD diagnostic statement, and 5.4% had an ASD ICD code only. ASD prevalence per 1,000 children aged 8 years that was based exclusively on documented ASD diagnostic statements was 17.4 overall (range: 11.2 in Maryland to 29.9 in California). The median age of earliest known ASD diagnosis ranged from 36 months in California to 63 months in Minnesota. Among the 3,007 children with ASD and data on cognitive ability, 35.2% were classified as having an intelligence quotient (IQ) score \u226470. The percentages of children with ASD with IQ scores \u226470 were 49.8%, 33.1%, and 29.7% among Black, Hispanic, and White children, respectively. Overall, children with ASD and IQ scores \u226470 had earlier median ages of ASD diagnosis than children with ASD and IQ scores >70 (44 versus 53 months).\nIn 2018, one in 44 children aged 8 years was estimated to have ASD, and prevalence and median age of identification varied widely across sites. Whereas overall ASD prevalence was similar by race and ethnicity, at certain sites Hispanic children were less likely to be identified as having ASD than White or Black children. The higher proportion of Black children compared with White and Hispanic children classified as having intellectual disability was consistent with previous findings.\nThe variability in ASD prevalence and community ASD identification practices among children with different racial, ethnic, and geographical characteristics highlights the importance of research into the causes of that variability and strategies to provide equitable access to developmental evaluations and services. These findings also underscore the need for enhanced infrastructure for diagnostic, treatment, and support services to meet the needs of all children.", "High-level quantum mechanical (QM) calculations are indispensable for accurate explanation of natural phenomena on the atomistic level. Their staggering computational cost, however, poses great limitations, which luckily can be lifted to a great extent by exploiting advances in artificial intelligence (AI). Here we introduce the general-purpose, highly transferable artificial intelligence-quantum mechanical method 1 (AIQM1). It approaches the accuracy of the gold-standard coupled cluster QM method with high computational speed of the approximate low-level semiempirical QM methods for the neutral,\u00a0closed-shell species in the ground state. AIQM1 can provide accurate ground-state energies for diverse organic compounds as well as geometries for even challenging systems such as large conjugated compounds (fullerene C60) close to experiment. This opens an opportunity to investigate chemical compounds with previously unattainable speed and accuracy as we demonstrate by determining geometries of polyyne molecules-the task difficult for both experiment and theory. Noteworthy, our method's accuracy is also good for ions and excited-state properties, although the neural network part of AIQM1 was never fitted to these properties.", "This study aims to design a set of the visual artificial intelligence system based on medical information mining for hospital emergency care management. A visual artificial intelligence emergency first aid nursing management system is designed by analyzing the needs of the emergency first aid nursing management system. The results show that system personnel allocation, comparative management, record management, query management analysis, basic setup analysis, nursing management basis, and nonfunctional requirements all need to be optimized for the emergency first aid management system. In this study, the comparative management module, log management module, and the query management module are designed, and the emergency first aid management system of different APP terminal functions in different modules is described in detail. The nursing document query business is tested, and the corresponding time of query of nursing assessment sheet, nurse shift record, nurse record, and physical sign observation sheet is 375.50\u2009ms, 351.48\u2009ms, 336.36\u2009ms, and 245.57\u2009ms, respectively. It shows that the visual artificial intelligence emergency nursing management system based on medical information mining can provide convenience for clinical work to a large extent and has potential application value in hospital emergency nursing work.", "This study aimed to develop an artificial intelligence model that can detect mesiodens on panoramic radiographs of various dentition groups. Panoramic radiographs of 612 patients were used for training. A convolutional neural network (CNN) model based on YOLOv3 for detecting mesiodens was developed. The model performance according to three dentition groups (primary, mixed, and permanent dentition) was evaluated, both internally (130 images) and externally (118 images), using a multi-center dataset. To investigate the effect of image preprocessing, contrast-limited histogram equalization (CLAHE) was applied to the original images. The accuracy of the internal test dataset was 96.2% and that of the external test dataset was 89.8% in the original images. For the primary, mixed, and permanent dentition, the accuracy of the internal test dataset was 96.7%, 97.5%, and 93.3%, respectively, and the accuracy of the external test dataset was 86.7%, 95.3%, and 86.7%, respectively. The CLAHE images yielded less accurate results than the original images in both test datasets. The proposed model showed good performance in the internal and external test datasets and had the potential for clinical use to detect mesiodens on panoramic radiographs of all dentition types. The CLAHE preprocessing had a negligible effect on model performance.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) is an iterative process by which information is captured, transformed into knowledge and processed to produce adaptive changes in the environment. AI is a broad concept, involving virtual (computing) and physical (robotics) elements. In this narrative literature review, we focus on the aspects of AI that present major opportunities for developing health care. Within a few years, AI will be part of our daily clinical practice. Although significant advances are being made, the application of AI in musculoskeletal medicine is still in its early stages compared with its implementation in other areas of medicine. AI is increasingly being employed in fields such as musculoskeletal radiology, skeletal trauma, orthopedic surgery, physical and rehabilitation medicine and sports medicine, as well as for \"big data\" and AI in gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy related injuries. Among the limitations of IA are that it analyzes information based on the data it is supplied, which must therefore be well-labeled and that some algorithms such as DL uses more time, data, and computational power than other techniques. Moreover, AI currently does not solve the problem of causality that exists in medicine with observational data; information that physicians interpret within a broad clinical context. AI should therefore be integrated in a prudent and reasonable manner into the workflows of health professionals.", "The practice of mathematics involves discovering patterns and using these to formulate and prove conjectures, resulting in theorems. Since the 1960s, mathematicians have used computers to assist in the discovery of patterns and formulation of conjectures1, most famously in the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture2, a Millennium Prize Problem3. Here we provide examples of new fundamental results in pure mathematics that have been discovered with the assistance of machine learning-demonstrating a method by which machine learning can aid mathematicians in discovering new conjectures and theorems. We propose a process of using machine learning to discover potential patterns and relations between mathematical objects, understanding them with attribution techniques and using these observations to guide intuition and propose conjectures. We outline this machine-learning-guided framework and demonstrate its successful application to current research questions in distinct areas of pure mathematics, in each case showing how it led to meaningful mathematical contributions on important open problems: a new connection between the algebraic and geometric structure of knots, and a candidate algorithm predicted by the combinatorial invariance conjecture for symmetric groups4. Our work may serve as a model for collaboration between the fields of mathematics and artificial intelligence (AI) that can achieve surprising results by leveraging the respective strengths of mathematicians and machine learning.", "Mobile apps for mental health are available on the market. Although they seem to be promising for improving the accessibility of mental health care, little is known about their acceptance, design methodology, evaluation, and integration into psychotherapy protocols. This makes it difficult for health care professionals to judge whether these apps may help them and their patients.\nOur aim is to describe and evaluate a protocol for the participatory design of mobile apps for mental health. In this study, participants and psychotherapists are engaged in the early phases of the design and development of the app empowered by conversational artificial intelligence (AI). The app supports interventions for stress management training based on cognitive behavioral theory.\nA total of 21 participants aged 33-61 years with mild to moderate levels of stress, anxiety, and depression (assessed by administering the Italian versions of the Symptom Checklist-90-Revised, Occupational Stress Indicator, and Perceived Stress Scale) were assigned randomly to 2 groups, A and B. Both groups received stress management training sessions along with cognitive behavioral treatment, but only participants assigned to group A received support through a mobile personal health care agent, designed for mental care and empowered by AI techniques. Psychopathological outcomes were assessed at baseline (T1), after 8 weeks of treatment (T2), and 3 months after treatment (T3). Focus groups with psychotherapists who administered the therapy were held after treatment to collect their impressions and suggestions.\nAlthough the intergroup statistical analysis showed that group B participants could rely on better coping strategies, group A participants reported significant improvements in obsessivity and compulsivity and positive distress symptom assessment. The psychotherapists' acceptance of the protocol was good. In particular, they were in favor of integrating an AI-based mental health app into their practice because they could appreciate the increased engagement of patients in pursuing their therapy goals.\nThe integration into practice of an AI-based mobile app for mental health was shown to be acceptable to both mental health professionals and users. Although it was not possible in this experiment to show that the integration of AI-based conversational technologies into traditional remote psychotherapy significantly decreased the participants' levels of stress and anxiety, the experimental results showed significant trends of reduction of symptoms in group A and their persistence over time. The mental health professionals involved in the experiment reported interest in, and acceptance of, the proposed technology as a promising tool to be included in a blended model of psychotherapy.", "With the global outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) all over the world, artificial intelligence (AI) technology is widely used in COVID-19 and has become a hot topic. In recent 2\u00a0years, the application of AI technology in COVID-19 has developed rapidly, and more than 100 relevant papers are published every month. In this paper, we combined with the bibliometric and visual knowledge map analysis, used the WOS database as the sample data source, and applied VOSviewer and CiteSpace analysis tools to carry out multi-dimensional statistical analysis and visual analysis about 1903 pieces of literature of recent 2\u00a0years (by the end of July this year). The data is analyzed by several terms with the main annual article and citation count, major publication sources, institutions and countries, their contribution and collaboration, etc. Since last year, the research on the COVID-19 has sharply increased; especially the corresponding research fields combined with the AI technology are expanding, such as medicine, management, economics, and informatics. The China and USA are the most prolific countries in AI applied in COVID-19, which have made a significant contribution to AI applied in COVID-19, as the high-level international collaboration of countries and institutions is increasing and more impactful. Moreover, we widely studied the issues: detection, surveillance, risk prediction, therapeutic research, virus modeling, and analysis of COVID-19. Finally, we put forward perspective challenges and limits to the application of AI in the COVID-19 for researchers and practitioners to facilitate future research on AI applied in COVID-19.", "To develop an application (TopEye) in the iOS platform for mobile devices to allow the capture and interpretation of color maps generated by corneal topographers using artificial intelligence.\nIn the execution, follow-up, and assessment of the project, we used the Scrum methodology and interactive and incremental development process for the project management and agile software development. The ge nerated diagnostic pattern bank consists of 1,172 examples of corneal topography, divided into 275 spherical, 302 symmetrical, 295 asymmetrical, and 300 irregular patterns (keratoconus). For the development of the artificial intelligence of the application, network training was established with 240 images of each pattern type, with a total of 960 patterns (81.91%). The remaining 212 images (18.09%) were used to test the application and will be used for the results. The process is semi-automatic, so the topographic image is captured with a smartphone, the examiner performs the contour of the corneal relief manually, and then the neural network performs the diagnosis.\nThe application diagnosed 201 cases (94.81%) correctly. In 212 images, the algorithm missed the classification of 11 cases (5.19%). The major error that occurred was in distinguishing between symmetrical and asymmetrical classes. In keratoconus screening, the application reached 95.00% sensitivity and 98.68% specificity.\nThe work resulted in obtaining an efficient application to capture topographic images using a smartphone camera and their interpretations through applied artificial intelligence.", "The use of artificial intelligence (AI) is accelerating in all aspects of medicine and has the potential to transform clinical care and dermatology workflows. However, to develop image-based algorithms for dermatology applications, comprehensive criteria establishing development and performance evaluation standards are required to ensure product fairness, reliability, and safety.\nTo consolidate limited existing literature with expert opinion to guide developers and reviewers of dermatology AI.\nIn this consensus statement, the 19 members of the International Skin Imaging Collaboration AI working group volunteered to provide a consensus statement. A systematic PubMed search was performed of English-language articles published between December 1, 2008, and August 24, 2021, for \"artificial intelligence\" and \"reporting guidelines,\" as well as other pertinent studies identified by the expert panel. Factors that were viewed as critical to AI development and performance evaluation were included and underwent 2 rounds of electronic discussion to achieve consensus.\nA checklist of items was developed that outlines best practices of image-based AI development and assessment in dermatology.\nClinically effective AI needs to be fair, reliable, and safe; this checklist of best practices will help both developers and reviewers achieve this goal.", "In order to study the application of image processing technology in remote monitoring and intelligent medical systems, the principle and implementation method of a remote intelligent image monitoring system based on virtual local area network is proposed; this method analyzes the key technologies to be considered in the remote realization of image monitoring, adopts advanced digital image compression coding and decoding technology and digital image transmission technology, and applies intelligent image processing and recognition technology to display, adjust, and track images; it overcomes the defects that the general monitoring system requires excessive intervention by monitoring personnel and low intelligence. After verification, the experimental results show that the proposed model can accurately and efficiently segment nonoverlapping cervical cell images, and compared with other existing models, this model has both higher segmentation accuracy and faster calculation speed. The application of multicast is still only in the laboratory or small local area network; with the further development of network technology, its application prospects will be very broad.", "Profound advances in computational methods, including artificial intelligence (AI), present the opportunity to use the exponentially growing volume and complexity of available cancer measurements toward data-driven personalized care. While exciting, this opportunity has highlighted the disconnect between the promise of compute and the supply of high-quality data. The current paradigm of ad-hoc aggregation and curation of data needs to be replaced with a \"metadata supply chain\" that provides robust data in context with known provenance, that is, lineage and comprehensive data governance that will allow the promise of AI technology to be realized to its full potential in clinical practice.", "Breast cancer analysis implies that radiologists inspect mammograms to detect suspicious breast lesions and identify mass tumors. Artificial intelligence techniques offer automatic systems for breast mass segmentation to assist radiologists in their diagnosis. With the rapid development of deep learning and its application to medical imaging challenges, UNet and its variations is one of the state-of-the-art models for medical image segmentation that showed promising performance on mammography. In this paper, we propose an architecture, called Connected-UNets, which connects two UNets using additional modified skip connections. We integrate Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) in the two standard UNets to emphasize the contextual information within the encoder-decoder network architecture. We also apply the proposed architecture on the Attention UNet (AUNet) and the Residual UNet (ResUNet). We evaluated the proposed architectures on two publically available datasets, the Curated Breast Imaging Subset of Digital Database for Screening Mammography (CBIS-DDSM) and INbreast, and additionally on a private dataset. Experiments were also conducted using additional synthetic data using the cycle-consistent Generative Adversarial Network (CycleGAN) model between two unpaired datasets to augment and enhance the images. Qualitative and quantitative results show that the proposed architecture can achieve better automatic mass segmentation with a high Dice score of 89.52%, 95.28%, and 95.88% and Intersection over Union (IoU) score of 80.02%, 91.03%, and 92.27%, respectively, on CBIS-DDSM, INbreast, and the private dataset.", "Physiatry is a medical specialty focused on improving functional outcomes in patients with a variety of medical conditions that affect the brain, spinal cord, peripheral nerves, muscles, bones, joints, ligaments, and tendons. Social determinants of health (SDH) play a key role in determining therapeutic process and patient functional outcomes. Big data and precision medicine have been used in other fields and to some extent in physiatry to predict patient outcomes, however many challenges remain. The interplay between SDH and physiatry outcomes is highly variable depending on different phases of care, and more favorable patient profiles in acute care may be less favorable in the outpatient setting. Furthermore, SDH influence which treatments or interventional procedures are accessible to the patient and thus determine outcomes. This opinion paper describes utility of existing datasets in combination with novel data such as movement, gait patterning and patient perceived outcomes could be analyzed with artificial intelligence methods to determine the best treatment plan for individual patients in order to achieve maximal functional capacity.", "The present study evaluated the importance of auxiliary traits of a principal trait based on phenotypic information and previously known genetic structure using computational intelligence and machine learning to develop predictive tools for plant breeding. Data of an F2 population represented by 500 individuals, obtained from a cross between contrasting homozygous parents, were simulated. Phenotypic traits were simulated based on previously established means and heritability estimates (30%, 50%, and 80%); traits were distributed in a genome with 10 linkage groups, considering two alleles per marker. Four different scenarios were considered. For the principal trait, heritability was 50%, and 40 control loci were distributed in five linkage groups. Another phenotypic control trait with the same complexity as the principal trait but without any genetic relationship with it and without pleiotropy or a factorial link between the control loci for both traits was simulated. These traits shared a large number of control loci with the principal trait, but could be distinguished by the differential action of the environment on them, as reflected in heritability estimates (30%, 50%, and 80%). The coefficient of determination were considered to evaluate the proposed methodologies. Multiple regression, computational intelligence, and machine learning were used to predict the importance of the tested traits. Computational intelligence and machine learning were superior in extracting nonlinear information from model inputs and quantifying the relative contributions of phenotypic traits. The R2 values ranged from 44.0% - 83.0% and 79.0% - 94.0%, for computational intelligence and machine learning, respectively. In conclusion, the relative contributions of auxiliary traits in different scenarios in plant breeding programs can be efficiently predicted using computational intelligence and machine learning.", "Functional foods are natural products of plants that have health benefits beyond necessary nutrition. Functional foods are abundant in fruits, vegetables, spices, beverages and some are found in cereals, millets, pulses and oilseeds. Efforts to identify functional foods in our diet and their beneficial aspects are limited to few crops. Advances in sequencing and availability of different omics technologies have given opportunity to utilize these tools to enhance the functional components of the foods, thus ensuring the nutritional security. Integrated omics approaches including genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics coupled with artificial intelligence and machine learning approaches can be used to improve the crops. This review provides insights into omics studies that are carried out to find the active components and crop improvement by enhancing the functional compounds in different plants including cereals, millets, pulses, oilseeds, fruits, vegetables, spices, beverages and medicinal plants. There is a need to characterize functional foods that are being used in traditional medicines, as well as utilization of this knowledge to improve the staple foods in order to tackle malnutrition and hunger more effectively.", "Intramedullary lesions can be challenging to diagnose, given the wide range of possible pathologies. Each lesion has unique clinical and imaging features, which are best evaluated using magnetic resonance imaging. Radiological imaging is unique with rich, descriptive patterns and classic signs-which are often metaphorical. In this review, we present a collection of classic MRI signs, ranging from neoplastic to non-neoplastic lesions, within the spinal cord. The Differential Diagnosis (DD) of intramedullary lesions can be narrowed down by careful analysis of the classic signs and patterns of involvement in the spinal cord. Furthermore, the signs are illustrated memorably with emphasis on the pathophysiology, mimics, and pitfalls. Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms, particularly deep learning, have made remarkable progress in image recognition tasks. The classic signs and related illustrations can enhance a pattern recognition approach in diagnostic radiology. Deep learning can potentially be designed to distinguish neoplastic from non-neoplastic processes by pattern recognition of the classic MRI signs.", "Global policy makers increasingly adopt subjective wellbeing as a framework within which to measure and address human development challenges, including policies to mitigate consequential societal problems. In this review, we take a systems-level perspective to assemble evidence from studies of wellbeing, of collective intelligence, and of metacognition and argue for a virtuous cycle for health promotion in which the increased collective intelligence of groups: (1) enhances the ability of such groups to address consequential societal problems; (2) promotes the wellbeing of societies and the individual wellbeing of people within groups; and, finally, (3) enables prosocial actions that further promote collective problem-solving and global wellbeing. Notably, evidence demonstrates that effective collaboration and teamwork largely depend on social skills for metacognitive awareness-the capacity to evaluate and control our own mental processes in the service of social problem-solving. Yet, despite their importance, metacognitive skills may not be well-captured by measures of general intelligence. These skills have instead been the focus of decades of research in the psychology of human judgment and decision-making. This literature provides well-validated tests of metacognitive awareness and demonstrates that the capacity to use analysis and deliberation to evaluate intuitive responses is an important source of individual differences in decision-making. Research in network neuroscience further elucidates the topology and dynamics of brain networks that enable metacognitive awareness, providing key targets for intervention. As such, we further discuss emerging scientific interventions to enhance metacognitive skills (e.g., based on mindfulness meditation, and physical activity and aerobic fitness), and how such interventions may catalyze the virtuous cycle to improve collective intelligence, societal problem-solving, and global wellbeing.", "The concept of cognitive reserve -CR- postulates two forms that prevent cognitive impairment: neural reserve and neural compensation. Both have been primarily linked to the protective role played by genetic factors, educational level, occupation or socioeconomic status. Though it is true that it has been related to executive functions, so far very little attention has been paid to its predictive capacity with other variables more related to social cognition and psychosocial adaptation. Considering socially vulnerable contexts with reduced cultural capital and educational levels, the neural reserve function would be the most relevant and best predictor of aspects related to social cognition and executive functions. We suggest that variables such as fluid and crystallized intelligence influence social cognition and executive functions. This study included a sample of 27 participants over 60 years old from varied contexts of social vulnerability. The procedure included data collection using various cognitive measures. Results show that elderly people with high intelligence-mainly fluid intelligence-have better executive functions, emotional recognition and theory of mind. These results focus on cognitive reserve and its importance because they show that elderly people in vulnerable contexts who strengthen these aspects protect themselves against the deterioration of cognitive skills. This study is the first preliminary research to present a relationship between cognitive reserve and social cognition factors in elderly subjects. Fluid intelligence functions as a highly related factor to protect the performance of executive functions, along with other social-cognitive factors relevant to facilitating the conditions of social adaptation.", "To address the disproportionate burden of preterm birth (PTB) in low- and middle-income countries, this study aimed to (1) verify the performance of the United States-validated spontaneous PTB (sPTB) predictor, comprised of the IBP4/SHBG protein ratio, in subjects from Bangladesh, Pakistan and Tanzania enrolled in the Alliance for Maternal and Newborn Health Improvement (AMANHI) biorepository study, and (2) discover biomarkers that improve performance of IBP4/SHBG in the AMANHI cohort.\nThe performance of the IBP4/SHBG biomarker was first evaluated in a nested case control validation study, then utilized in a follow-on discovery study performed on the same samples. Levels of serum proteins were measured by targeted mass spectrometry. Differences between the AMANHI and U.S. cohorts were adjusted using body mass index (BMI) and gestational age (GA) at blood draw as covariates. Prediction of sPTB < 37\u2009weeks and < 34\u2009weeks was assessed by area under the receiver operator curve (AUC). In the discovery phase, an artificial intelligence method selected additional protein biomarkers complementary to IBP4/SHBG in the AMANHI cohort.\nThe IBP4/SHBG biomarker significantly predicted sPTB < 37\u2009weeks (n\u2009=\u200988 vs. 171 terms \u2265 37\u2009weeks) after adjusting for BMI and GA at blood draw (AUC= 0.64, 95% CI: 0.57-0.71, p\u2009<\u2009.001). Performance was similar for sPTB < 34\u2009weeks (n\u2009=\u200917 vs. 184\u2009\u2265\u200934\u2009weeks): AUC = 0.66, 95% CI: 0.51-0.82, p\u2009=\u2009.012. The discovery phase of the study showed that the addition of endoglin, prolactin, and tetranectin to the above model resulted in the prediction of sPTB < 37 with an AUC= 0.72 (95% CI: 0.66-0.79, p-value\u2009<\u2009.001) and prediction of sPTB < 34 with an AUC of 0.78 (95% CI: 0.67-0.90, p\u2009<\u2009.001).\nA protein biomarker pair developed in the U.S. may have broader application in diverse non-U.S. populations.", "Background: Atherosclerosis is the primary cause of the cardiovascular disease (CVD). Several risk factors lead to atherosclerosis, and altered nutrition is one among those. Nutrition has been ignored quite often in the process of CVD risk assessment. Altered nutrition along with carotid ultrasound imaging-driven atherosclerotic plaque features can help in understanding and banishing the problems associated with the late diagnosis of CVD. Artificial intelligence (AI) is another promisingly adopted technology for CVD risk assessment and management. Therefore, we hypothesize that the risk of atherosclerotic CVD can be accurately monitored using carotid ultrasound imaging, predicted using AI-based algorithms, and reduced with the help of proper nutrition. Layout: The review presents a pathophysiological link between nutrition and atherosclerosis by gaining a deep insight into the processes involved at each stage of plaque development. After targeting the causes and finding out results by low-cost, user-friendly, ultrasound-based arterial imaging, it is important to (i) stratify the risks and (ii) monitor them by measuring plaque burden and computing risk score as part of the preventive framework. Artificial intelligence (AI)-based strategies are used to provide efficient CVD risk assessments. Finally, the review presents the role of AI for CVD risk assessment during COVID-19. Conclusions: By studying the mechanism of low-density lipoprotein formation, saturated and trans fat, and other dietary components that lead to plaque formation, we demonstrate the use of CVD risk assessment due to nutrition and atherosclerosis disease formation during normal and COVID times. Further, nutrition if included, as a part of the associated risk factors can benefit from atherosclerotic disease progression and its management using AI-based CVD risk assessment.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) holds the promise of supporting nurses' clinical decision-making in complex care situations or conducting tasks that are remote from direct patient interaction, such as documentation processes. There has been an increase in the research and development of AI applications for nursing care, but there is a persistent lack of an extensive overview covering the evidence base for promising application scenarios.\nThis study synthesizes literature on application scenarios for AI in nursing care settings as well as highlights adjacent aspects in the ethical, legal, and social discourse surrounding the application of AI in nursing care.\nFollowing a rapid review design, PubMed, CINAHL, Association for Computing Machinery Digital Library, Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Xplore, Digital Bibliography & Library Project, and Association for Information Systems Library, as well as the libraries of leading AI conferences, were searched in June 2020. Publications of original quantitative and qualitative research, systematic reviews, discussion papers, and essays on the ethical, legal, and social implications published in English were included. Eligible studies were analyzed on the basis of predetermined selection criteria.\nThe titles and abstracts of 7016 publications and 704 full texts were screened, and 292 publications were included. Hospitals were the most prominent study setting, followed by independent living at home; fewer application scenarios were identified for nursing homes or home care. Most studies used machine learning algorithms, whereas expert or hybrid systems were entailed in less than every 10th publication. The application context of focusing on image and signal processing with tracking, monitoring, or the classification of activity and health followed by care coordination and communication, as well as fall detection, was the main purpose of AI applications. Few studies have reported the effects of AI applications on clinical or organizational outcomes, lacking particularly in data gathered outside laboratory conditions. In addition to technological requirements, the reporting and inclusion of certain requirements capture more overarching topics, such as data privacy, safety, and technology acceptance. Ethical, legal, and social implications reflect the discourse on technology use in health care but have mostly not been discussed in meaningful and potentially encompassing detail.\nThe results highlight the potential for the application of AI systems in different nursing care settings. Considering the lack of findings on the effectiveness and application of AI systems in real-world scenarios, future research should reflect on a more nursing care-specific perspective toward objectives, outcomes, and benefits. We identify that, crucially, an advancement in technological-societal discourse that surrounds the ethical and legal implications of AI applications in nursing care is a necessary next step. Further, we outline the need for greater participation among all of the stakeholders involved.", "Clinical databases, particularly those composed of big data, face growing security challenges. Blockchain, the open, decentralized, distributed public ledger technology powering cryptocurrency, records transactions securely without the need for third-party verification. In the health care setting, decentralized blockchain networks offer a secure interoperable gateway for clinical research and practice data. Here, we discuss recent advances and potential future directions for the application of blockchain and its integration with artificial intelligence (AI) in cardiovascular medicine. We first review the basic underlying concepts of this technology and contextualise it within the spectrum of current, well known applications. We then consider specific applications for cardiovascular medicine and research in areas such as high-throughput gene sequencing, wearable technologies, and clinical trials. We then evaluate current challenges to effective implementation and future directions. We also summarise the health care applications that can be realised by combining decentralized blockchain computing platforms (for data security) and AI computing (for data analytics). By leveraging high-performance computing and AI capable of securely managing large and rapidly expanding medical databases, blockchain incorporation can provide clinically meaningful predictions, help advance research methodology (eg, via robust AI-blockchain decentralized clinical trials), and provide virtual tools in clinical practice (eg, telehealth, sensory-based technologies, wearable medical devices). Integrating AI and blockchain approaches synergistically amplifies the strengths of both technologies to create novel solutions to serve the objective of providing precision cardiovascular medicine.", "There is a gap in the nursing literature about the significant contributions of executive military nurse leaders to the advancement of nursing as a profession and into interprofessional leadership roles. Many executive military nurse leaders have demonstrated the value of nursing leadership in non-traditional roles and paved the way to expand the leadership opportunities for nurses who would follow. The purpose of this study is to explore the personal stories, experiences, leadership strategies, and lessons learned through the eyes of the first nurse to achieve the rank of Major General in the U.S. Air Force.\nThe oral history method guided the exploration of participant memories and experiences. In compliance with the Oral History Association guidelines, the investigator obtained Institution Review Board permission, informed consent, and audiotaped interviews. An expert panel provided feedback on the appropriate language use in semi-structured interview questions with Air Force nurse executives. The oral history method provided a framework for the semi-structured interview and analysis. Active listening techniques such as exploration, clarifying, and paraphrasing helped foster deep listening. A graduate research assistant transcribed the 4-hour interview verbatim. The primary investigator emailed a copy of the transcript to the participant to verify accuracy and clarify content. Analysis involved examination and interpretation of the professional, military, nursing, and participant's personal perspective to enhance historical understanding. Three independent coders extracted prevalent themes and subthemes during analysis.\nRepetitive major themes of courage, figuring it out, and winning others over emerged during data analysis. The major theme of courage has corresponding subthemes of tenacity, risk-taking, and re-writing the narrative. The major theme of figuring it out has subthemes of optimism, creativity, connectedness, learning, and managing change. Lastly, the winning others over theme has subthemes of emotional intelligence, teamwork, role-model/mentor, and moving from outsider to insider. The leadership strategies of taking calculated risks while remaining calm, being open to opportunities that she had never considered, and spending time learning new skills contributed to repeated advancement into higher leadership positions not previously held by a nurse within the U.S. Air Force.\nThe interview is packed full of leadership lessons that are just as relative today as 20\u2009years ago. This presentation will conclude with a discussion of the most effective leadership strategies, the lasting impact of the leadership accomplishments, and current implications for nurse leaders today.", "The Varian Ethos system allows for online adaptive treatments through the utilization of artificial intelligence (AI) and deformable image registration which automates large parts of the anatomical contouring and plan optimization process. In this study, treatments of intact prostate and prostate bed, with and without nodes, were simulated for 182 online adaptive fractions, and then a further 184 clinical fractions were delivered on the Ethos system. Frequency and magnitude of contour edits were recorded, as well as a range of plan quality metrics. From the fractions analyzed, 11% of AI generated contours, known as influencer contours, required no change, and 81% required minor edits in any given fraction. The frequency of target and noninfluencer organs at risk (OAR) contour editing varied substantially between different targets and noninfluencer OARs, although across all targets 72% of cases required no edits. The adaptive plan was the preference in 95% of fractions. The adaptive plan met more goals than the scheduled plan in 78% of fractions, while in 15% of fractions the number of goals met was the same. The online adaptive recontouring and replanning process was carried out in 19 min on average. Significant improvements in dosimetry are possible with the Ethos online adaptive system in prostate radiotherapy.", "Many areas of psychology assume that performance on tasks of interest is stable through time. Here, using time-sensitive modeling of working memory task performance, we show not only was this assumption incorrect, but that certain components of the performance trajectory (e.g., final task performance; rate of change) were independently predictive of fluid intelligence. This fact has clear implications for theoretical frameworks linking working memory and fluid intelligence, and beyond.", "Dry eye disease (DED) has a prevalence of between 5 and 50%, depending on the diagnostic criteria used and population under study. However, it remains one of the most underdiagnosed and undertreated conditions in ophthalmology. Many tests used in the diagnosis of DED rely on an experienced observer for image interpretation, which may be considered subjective and result in variation in diagnosis. Since artificial intelligence (AI) systems are capable of advanced problem solving, use of such techniques could lead to more objective diagnosis. Although the term 'AI' is commonly used, recent success in its applications to medicine is mainly due to advancements in the sub-field of machine learning, which has been used to automatically classify images and predict medical outcomes. Powerful machine learning techniques have been harnessed to understand nuances in patient data and medical images, aiming for consistent diagnosis and stratification of disease severity. This is the first literature review on the use of AI in DED. We provide a brief introduction to AI, report its current use in DED research and its potential for application in the clinic. Our review found that AI has been employed in a wide range of DED clinical tests and research applications, primarily for interpretation of interferometry, slit-lamp and meibography images. While initial results are promising, much work is still needed on model development, clinical testing and standardisation.", "Computer-aided composition is an attempt to use a formalized process to minimize human (or composer) involvement in the creation of music using a computer. Exploring the problem of computer-aided composition can enable us to understand and simulate the thinking mode of composers in the special process of music creation, which is an important application of artificial intelligence in the field of art. Feature extraction on the MIDI files has been introduced in this paper. Based on the genetic algorithm in this paper, a platform of the sampling coding method to optimize the character representation has solved the traditional algorithmic music composition study. Music directly from the pitch and duration can be derived from the characteristics, respectively, in the form of a one-hot encoding independently said. Failure to the rhythm of the characterization of the pitch and duration are problems that lead to the inability of compositional networks to learn musical styles better. Rhythm is the combination of pitch and time values according to certain rules. The rhythm of music affects the overall style of music. By associating the pitch and time value coding, the rhythm style of music can be preserved better so that the composition network can learn the style characteristics of music more easily.", "Airways segmentation is important for research about pulmonary disease but require a large amount of time by trained specialists. We used an openly available software to improve airways segmentations obtained from an artificial intelligence (AI) tool and retrained the tool to get a better performance. Fifteen initial airway segmentations from low-dose chest computed tomography scans were obtained with a 3D-Unet AI tool previously trained on Danish Lung Cancer Screening Trial and Erasmus-MC Sophia datasets. Segmentations were manually corrected in 3D Slicer. The corrected airway segmentations were used to retrain the 3D-Unet. Airway measurements were automatically obtained and included count, airway length and luminal diameter per generation from the segmentations. Correcting segmentations required 2-4\u2009h per scan. Manually corrected segmentations had more branches (p <\u20090.001), longer airways (p <\u20090.001) and smaller luminal diameters (p = 0.004) than initial segmentations. Segmentations from retrained 3D-Unets trended towards more branches and longer airways compared to the initial segmentations. The largest changes were seen in airways from 6th generation onwards. Manual correction results in significantly improved segmentations and is potentially a useful and time-efficient method to improve the AI tool performance on a specific hospital or research dataset.", "We review recent studies comparing intraocular lens (IOL) formulas with an emphasis on selection of the highest performing formulas based on patient axial length, age, and history of previous corneal refractive surgery.\nThe Barrett Universal II formula based on a theoretical model has consistently demonstrated high accuracy. The Olsen four-factor formula using ray tracing optics and the Hill-RBF calculator using artificial intelligence have also demonstrated good prediction results after being updated. Notably, the Kane formula, incorporating artificial intelligence, has overall shown the best performance for all axial lengths. Although newly developed and updated IOL formulas have improved refractive prediction in patients with short or long axial length eyes or prior history of corneal refractive surgery, these challenging cases still require special consideration. The Barrett True-K formula has shown accurate results regardless of preoperative data in eyes with previous myopic refractive surgery.\nAdvancements in optical biometry and IOL calculation formulas continue to improve refractive outcomes. The clinician can optimize refractive outcomes in the majority of patients with the use of formulas that have shown consistent results and accuracy in several large studies.", "The estimation of chronological age from biological fluids has been an important quest for forensic scientists worldwide, with recent approaches exploiting the variability of DNA methylation patterns with age in order to develop the next generation of forensic 'DNA intelligence' tools for this application. Drawing from the conclusions of previous work utilising massively parallel sequencing (MPS) for this analysis, this work introduces a DNA methylation-based age estimation method for blood that exhibits the best combination of prediction accuracy and sensitivity reported to date. Statistical evaluation of markers from 51 studies using microarray data from over 4000 individuals, followed by validation using in-house generated MPS data, revealed a final set of 11 markers with the greatest potential for accurate age estimation from minimal DNA material. Utilising an algorithm based on support vector machines, the proposed model achieved an average error (MAE) of 3.3 years, with this level of accuracy retained down to 5\u00a0ng of starting DNA input (~ 1\u00a0ng PCR input). The accuracy of the model was retained (MAE = 3.8 years) in a separate test set of 88 samples of Spanish origin, while predictions for donors of greater forensic interest (< 55 years of age) displayed even higher accuracy (MAE = 2.6 years). Finally, no sex-related bias was observed for this model, while there were also no signs of variation observed between control and disease-associated populations for schizophrenia, rheumatoid arthritis, frontal temporal dementia and progressive supranuclear palsy in microarray data relating to the 11 markers.", "Heart disease is the leading cause of death from chronic diseases in the developing countries. The difficulty of making an accurate and timely diagnosis is exacerbated by a lack of resources and professionals in some areas, which contributes to this reality. Medical professionals may benefit from technological advancements that aid in the accurate diagnosis of patients. In light of these findings, a hybrid diagnostic tool has been developed that combines several computational intelligence (machine learning) techniques capable of analyzing clinical histories and images of electrocardiogram signals and indicating whether or not the patient has ischemic heart disease with up to 97.01% accuracy. Working with medical experts and a database containing clinical data on approximately 1020 patients and their diagnoses was required for this project. Both were put to use. A picture database containing 92 images of electrocardiogram signals was also used in this project for the analysis of the Artificial Neural Network. After extensive research and testing by the medical community, which supported the project and provided positive feedback, a successful tool was developed. This demonstrated the tool's effectiveness.", "Managing navigational safety is a key responsibility of coastal states. Predicting and measuring these risks has a high complexity due to their infrequent occurrence, multitude of causes, and large study areas. As a result, maritime risk models are generally limited in scale to small regions, generalized across diverse environments, or rely on the use of expert judgement. Therefore, such an approach has limited scalability and may incorrectly characterize the risk. Within this article a novel method for undertaking spatial modeling of maritime risk is proposed through machine learning. This enables navigational safety to be characterized while leveraging the significant volumes of relevant data available. The method comprises two key components: aggregation of historical accident data, vessel traffic, and other exploratory features into a spatial grid; and the implementation of several classification algorithms that predicts annual accident occurrence for various vessel types. This approach is applied to characterize the risk of collisions and groundings in the United Kingdom. The results vary between hazard types and vessel types but show remarkable capability at characterizing maritime risk, with accuracies and area under curve scores in excess of 90% in most implementations. Furthermore, the ensemble tree-based algorithms of XGBoost and Random Forest consistently outperformed other machine learning algorithms that were tested. The resultant potential risk maps provide decisionmakers with actionable intelligence in order to target risk mitigation measures in regions with the greatest requirement.", "A barrier to practicing evidence-based medicine is the rapidly increasing body of biomedical literature. Use of method terms to limit the search can help reduce the burden of screening articles for clinical relevance; however, such terms are limited by their partial dependence on indexing terms and usually produce low precision, especially when high sensitivity is required. Machine learning has been applied to the identification of high-quality literature with the potential to achieve high precision without sacrificing sensitivity. The use of artificial intelligence has shown promise to improve the efficiency of identifying sound evidence.\nThe primary objective of this research is to derive and validate deep learning machine models using iterations of Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) to retrieve high-quality, high-relevance evidence for clinical consideration from the biomedical literature.\nUsing the HuggingFace Transformers library, we will experiment with variations of BERT models, including BERT, BioBERT, BlueBERT, and PubMedBERT, to determine which have the best performance in article identification based on quality criteria. Our experiments will utilize a large data set of over 150,000 PubMed citations from 2012 to 2020 that have been manually labeled based on their methodological rigor for clinical use. We will evaluate and report on the performance of the classifiers in categorizing articles based on their likelihood of meeting quality criteria. We will report fine-tuning hyperparameters for each model, as well as their performance metrics, including recall (sensitivity), specificity, precision, accuracy, F-score, the number of articles that need to be read before finding one that is positive (meets criteria), and classification probability scores.\nInitial model development is underway, with further development planned for early 2022. Performance testing is expected to star in February 2022. Results will be published in 2022.\nThe experiments will aim to improve the precision of retrieving high-quality articles by applying a machine learning classifier to PubMed searching.\nDERR1-10.2196/29398.", "There is increasing popularity in the use of artificial intelligence and machine-learning techniques to provide diagnostic and prognostic models for various aspects of Trauma & Orthopaedic surgery. However, correct interpretation of these models is difficult for those without specific knowledge of computing or health data science methodology. Lack of current reporting standards leads to the potential for significant heterogeneity in the design and quality of published studies. We provide an overview of machine-learning techniques for the lay individual, including key terminology and best practice reporting guidelines.

In this context, some decision-support systems, mostly based on deep learning techniques, have already been approved for clinical purposes. Despite all the efforts in introducing artificial intelligence methods in the workflow of clinicians, its lack of interpretability - understand how the methods make decisions - still inhibits their dissemination in clinical practice. The aim of this article is to present an easy guide for oncologists explaining how these methods make decisions and illustrating the strategies to explain them. Theoretical concepts were illustrated based on oncological examples and a literature review of research works was performed from PubMed between January 2014 to September 2020, using \"deep learning techniques,\" \"interpretability\" and \"oncology\" as keywords. Overall, more than 60% are related to breast, skin or brain cancers and the majority focused on explaining the importance of tumor characteristics (e.g. dimension, shape) in the predictions. The most used computational methods are multilayer perceptrons and convolutional neural networks. Nevertheless, despite being successfully applied in different cancers scenarios, endowing deep learning techniques with interpretability, while maintaining their performance, continues to be one of the greatest challenges of artificial intelligence.", "Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease nowadays, including different biological subtypes with a variety of possible treatments, which aim to achieve the best outcome in terms of response to therapy and overall survival. In recent years breast imaging has evolved considerably, and the ultimate goal is to predict these strong phenotypic differences noninvasively. Indeed, breast cancer multiparametric studies can highlight not only qualitative imaging parameters, as the presence/absence of a likely malignant finding, but also quantitative parameters, suggesting clinical-pathological features through the evaluation of imaging biomarkers. A further step has been the introduction of artificial intelligence and in particular radiogenomics, that investigates the relationship between breast cancer imaging characteristics and tumor molecular, genomic and proliferation features. In this review, we discuss the main techniques currently in use for breast imaging, their respective fields of use and their technological and diagnostic innovations.", "While COVID-19 is still ongoing and associated with more than 5 million deaths, the scope and speed of advances over the past year in terms of scientific discovery, data dissemination, and technology have been staggering. It is not a matter of \"if\" but \"when\" we will face the next pandemic, and how we leverage technology and data management effectively to create flexible ecosystems that facilitate collaboration, equitable care, and innovation will determine its severity and scale. The aim of this review is to address emerging challenges that came to light during the pandemic in health care and innovations that enabled us to adapt and continue to care for patients. The pandemic highlighted the need for seismic shifts in care paradigms and technology with considerations related to the digital divide and health literacy for digital health interventions to reach full potential and improve health outcomes. We discuss advances in telemedicine, remote patient monitoring, and emerging wearable technologies. Despite the promise of digital health, we emphasise the importance of addressing its limitations, including interpretation challenges, accuracy of findings, and artificial intelligence-driven algorithms. We summarise the most recent recommendation of the Virtual Care Task Force to scaling virtual medical services in Canada. Finally, we propose a model for optimal implementation of health digital innovations with 5 tenets including data management, data security, digital biomarkers, useful artificial intelligence, and clinical integration.\nAlors que la pand\u00e9mie, toujours en cours, a caus\u00e9 plus de cinq millions de d\u00e9c\u00e8s, la port\u00e9e et la rapidit\u00e9 des avanc\u00e9es r\u00e9alis\u00e9es au cours de la derni\u00e8re ann\u00e9e en mati\u00e8re de d\u00e9couverte scientifique, de communication des donn\u00e9es et sur le plan technologique ont \u00e9t\u00e9 stup\u00e9fiantes.

At the same time, current screening guidelines for venous thromboembolism risk have low sensitivity for CADVT in hospitalized children. This study utilized a multimodal deep learning model to predict CADVT before it occurs.\nChildren who were admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) between December 2015 and December 2018 and with CVC placement at least 3\u00a0days were included. The variables analyzed included demographic characteristics, clinical conditions, laboratory test results, vital signs and medications. A multimodal deep learning (MMDL) model that can handle temporal data using long short-term memory (LSTM) and gated recurrent units (GRUs) was proposed for this prediction task. Four benchmark machine learning models, logistic regression (LR), random forest (RF), gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) and a published cutting edge MMDL, were used to compare and evaluate the models with a fivefold cross-validation approach. Accuracy, recall, area under the ROC curve (AUC), and average precision (AP) were used to evaluate the discrimination of each model at three time points (24\u00a0h, 48\u00a0h and 72\u00a0h) before CADVT occurred. Brier score and Spiegelhalter's z test were used measure the calibration of these prediction models.\nA total of 1830 patients were included in this study, and approximately 15% developed CADVT. In the CADVT prediction task, the model proposed in this paper significantly outperforms both traditional machine learning models and existing multimodal deep learning models at all 3 time points. It achieved 77% accuracy and 90% recall at 24\u00a0h before CADVT was discovered. It can be used to accurately predict the occurrence of CADVT 72\u00a0h in advance with an accuracy of greater than 75%, a recall of more than 87%, and an AUC value of 0.82.\nIn this study, a machine learning method was successfully established to predict CADVT in advance. These findings demonstrate that artificial intelligence (AI) could provide measures for thromboprophylaxis in a pediatric intensive care setting.", "It is believed that artificial intelligence (AI) will be an integral part of health care services in the near future and will be incorporated into several aspects of clinical care such as prognosis, diagnostics, and care planning. Thus, many technology companies have invested in producing AI clinical applications. Patients are one of the most important beneficiaries who potentially interact with these technologies and applications; thus, patients' perceptions may affect the widespread use of clinical AI. Patients should be ensured that AI clinical applications will not harm them, and that they will instead benefit from using AI technology for health care purposes. Although human-AI interaction can enhance health care outcomes, possible dimensions of concerns and risks should be addressed before its integration with routine clinical care.\nThe main objective of this study was to examine how potential users (patients) perceive the benefits, risks, and use of AI clinical applications for their health care purposes and how their perceptions may be different if faced with three health care service encounter scenarios.\nWe designed a 2\u00d73 experiment that crossed a type of health condition (ie, acute or chronic) with three different types of clinical encounters between patients and physicians (ie, AI clinical applications as substituting technology, AI clinical applications as augmenting technology, and no AI as a traditional in-person visit). We used an online survey to collect data from 634 individuals in the United States.\nThe interactions between the types of health care service encounters and health conditions significantly influenced individuals' perceptions of privacy concerns, trust issues, communication barriers, concerns about transparency in regulatory standards, liability risks, benefits, and intention to use across the six scenarios. We found no significant differences among scenarios regarding perceptions of performance risk and social biases.\nThe results imply that incompatibility with instrumental, technical, ethical, or regulatory values can be a reason for rejecting AI applications in health care. Thus, there are still various risks associated with implementing AI applications in diagnostics and treatment recommendations for patients with both acute and chronic illnesses. The concerns are also evident if the AI applications are used as a recommendation system under physician experience, wisdom, and control. Prior to the widespread rollout of AI, more studies are needed to identify the challenges that may raise concerns for implementing and using AI applications. This study could provide researchers and managers with critical insights into the determinants of individuals' intention to use AI clinical applications. Regulatory agencies should establish normative standards and evaluation guidelines for implementing AI in health care in cooperation with health care institutions. Regular audits and ongoing monitoring and reporting systems can be used to continuously evaluate the safety, quality, transparency, and ethical factors of AI clinical applications.", "Research with adults suggests that executive function (EF) might play a role in the development of divergent thinking, a key component of creativity, by helping children override canonical knowledge.\nWe examined this possibility in two experiments, by manipulating the familiarity of objects used in the Alternate Uses test of divergent thinking both between-participants (Experiment 1: N\u00a0=\u00a053 4-year-olds and 50 6-year-olds) and within-participants (Experiment 2: N\u00a0=\u00a074 5-year-olds).\nWe found evidence that younger children generated more and/or more original ideas for novel than familiar objects. However, this effect disappeared with age and did not depend on child EF. Further, EF was inversely associated with divergent thinking, controlling for age, intelligence, and income.\nThese results call into question a simple executive account of children's divergent thinking and suggest that, among predominantly White, socioeconomically advantaged 4-6-year-olds, divergent idea-generation might be a primarily bottom-up process that can be hindered by top-down thinking.", "This long-term retrospective follow-up study aimed to address the knowledge gap between prenatal diagnosis of complete isolated Agenesis of Corpus Callosum (cACC) at fetal MRI and postnatal neurodevelopmental outcome to improve prenatal counseling for parents.\nData on fetuses with isolated cACC from a single-center MRI database built up in two decades were considered. Detailed postnatal clinical, neuropsychological evaluations were performed and descriptions of available neuroradiological and genetic data were provided.\nFollowing a detailed neuropsychological evaluation and a long-term follow-up, the subsequent results emerged: 38 school-aged children (older than 6\u2009years) of 50 (aged 2.5-15\u2009years) showed normal intellectual functions (50%), intellectual disability (21%), and borderline intelligence quotient (29%). Deficits in motor functions (58%), executive functions (37%), language (61%), memory abilities (58%), and academic performances (53%) were found. Twenty-one percent of participants showed behavioral difficulties. Almost half of the participants underwent rehabilitation. Additional findings (21%) were detected at postnatal brain MRI, and a significant association between additional findings at postnatal imaging and abnormal neurodevelopmental outcome was observed.\nThis study supports the view that children with prenatal diagnosis of isolated cACC may present with several degrees of neurologic and neuropsychological impairment which become more evident only in their second decade of life. Postnatal MRI and detailed genetic analysis may add crucial information to prenatal data and substantially influence final judgment on the outcome and orient clinical management and counseling.", "Imaging-based characterization of polymeric drug-eluting implants can be challenging due to the microstructural complexity and scale of dispersed drug domains and polymer matrix. The typical evaluation via real-time (and accelerated in vitro experiments not only can be very labor intensive since implants are designed to last for 3\u00a0months or longer, but also fails to elucidate the impact of the internal microstructure on the implant release rate. A novel characterization technique, combining multi-scale high resolution three-dimensional imaging, was developed for a mechanistic understanding of the impact of formulation and manufacturing process on the implant microstructure. Artificial intelligence-based image segmentation and imaging analytics convert \"visualized\" structural properties into numerical models, which can be used to calculate key parameters governing drug transport in the polymer matrix, such as effective permeability. Simulations of drug transport in structures constructed on the basis of image analytics can be used to predict the release rates for the drug-eluting implant without running lengthy experiments. Multi-scale imaging approach and image-based characterization generate a large amount of quantitative structural information that are difficult to obtain experimentally. The direct-imaging based analytics and simulation is a powerful tool and has potential to advance fundamental understanding of drug release mechanism and the development of robust drug-eluting implants.", "The treatment of wastewater is an essential factor in preventing pollutants and promoting the quality of the water. The inherent complexity, influential impact and the solid waste infrastructure all lead to confusion and variance in the primary clarifier for wastewater. These inconsistencies lead to variations in the purity and capacity constraints of wastewater and the existential impact of water receipt. Water treatment is a complicated task that has chemical, technical and biochemical aspects. A credible artificial neural network (ANN) method is necessary for another wastewater treatment plant to prevent the breakdown of the processes. Virtual reality seems to have become a strong solution for preventing waste management uncertainties and problems. This is not only due to extreme changes but also to significant external disturbances that water systems are subjected to when controlling challenges. Climate is among the most significant of such disturbances. Various environmental conditions actually include different influx frequencies and levels of substances. Water contamination has become one of the extremely serious growing concerns; sewage treatment plant identification is a key major issue here and the agencies enforce tighter requirements when operating wastewater software systems. This article plans to create models of achievement and prospects when possible future guidance of recent research borders for the use of artificial intelligence in wastewater treatment plants that concurrently deal with pollutants. This study has shown us that the composite ANN provides a greater level of competence in plant prediction and systemization.", "As the prevalence of diabetes increases, millions of people need to be screened for diabetic retinopathy (DR). Remarkable advances in technology have made it possible to use artificial intelligence to screen DR from retinal images with high accuracy and reliability, resulting in reducing human labor by processing large amounts of data in a shorter time. We developed a fully automated classification algorithm to diagnose DR and identify referable status using optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) images with convolutional neural network (CNN) model and verified its feasibility by comparing its performance with that of conventional machine learning model. Ground truths for classifications were made based on ultra-widefield fluorescein angiography to increase the accuracy of data annotation. The proposed CNN classifier achieved an accuracy of 91-98%, a sensitivity of 86-97%, a specificity of 94-99%, and an area under the curve of 0.919-0.976. In the external validation, overall similar performances were also achieved. The results were similar regardless of the size and depth of the OCTA images, indicating that DR could be satisfactorily classified even with images comprising narrow area of the macular region and a single image slab of retina. The CNN-based classification using OCTA is expected to create a novel diagnostic workflow for DR detection and referral.", "According to international transgender care guidelines, an important prerequisite for puberty suppression (PS) is transgender adolescents' competence to give informed consent (IC). In society, there is doubt whether transgender adolescents are capable of this, which in some countries has even led to limited access to this intervention. Therefore, this study examined transgender adolescents' medical decision-making competence (MDC) to give IC for starting PS in a structured, replicable way. Additionally, potential associated variables on MDC, such as age, intelligence, sex, psychological functioning, were investigated.\nA cross-sectional semistructured interview study with 74 transgender adolescents (aged 10-18 years; 16 birth-assigned boys, 58 birth-assigned girls) within two Dutch specialized gender-identity clinics was performed. To assess MDC, judgements based on the reference standard (clinical assessment) and the MacArthur Competence Assessment Tool for Treatment (MacCAT-T), a validated semistructured interview, were used.\nOf the transgender adolescents, 93.2% (reference standard judgements; 69 of 74) and 89.2% (MacCAT-T judgements; 66 of 74) were assessed competent to consent. Intermethod agreement was 87.8% (65 of 74). Interrater agreements of the reference standard and MacCAT-T-based judgements were 89.2% (198 of 222) and 86.5% (192 of 222), respectively. IQ and sex were both significantly related to MacCAT-T total score, whereas age, level of emotional and behavioral challenges, and diagnostic trajectories duration were not.\nBy using the MacCAT-T and clinicians' assessments, 93.2% and 89.2%, respectively, of the transgender adolescents in this study were assessed competent to consent for starting PS.", "The Covid-19 pandemic accelerated research and development not only in infectious diseases but also in digital technologies to improve monitoring, forecasting, and intervening on planetary and ecological risks. In the European Commission, the Destination Earth (DestinE) is a current major initiative to develop a digital model of the Earth (a \"digital twin\") with high precision. Moreover, omics systems science is undergoing digital transformation impacting nearly all dimensions of the field, including real-time phenotype capture to data analytics using machine learning and artificial intelligence, to name but a few emerging frontiers. We discuss the ways in which the current ongoing digital transformation in omics offers synergies with digital twins/DestinE. Importantly, we note here the rise of a new field of scholarship, planetary health genomics. We conclude that digital transformation in public and private sectors, digital twins/DestinE, and their convergence with omics systems science are poised to build robust capacities for pandemic preparedness and resilient societies in the 21st century.", "U. S. Supreme Court justices and other federal judges are, effectively, appointed for life, with no built-in check on their cognitive functioning as they approach old age. There is about a century of research on aging and intelligence that shows the vulnerability of processing speed, fluid reasoning, visual-spatial processing, and working memory to normal aging for men and women at all levels of education; even the maintained ability of crystallized knowledge declines in old age. The vulnerable abilities impact a person's decision-making and problem solving; crystallized knowledge, by contrast, measures a person's general knowledge. The aging-IQ data provide a rationale for assessing the key cognitive abilities of anyone who is appointed to the federal judiciary. Theories of multiple cognitive abilities and processes, most notably the Cattell-Horn-Carroll (CHC) model, provide a well-researched blueprint for interpreting the plethora of findings from studies of IQ and aging. Sophisticated technical advances in test construction, especially in item-response theory and computerized-adaptive testing, allow for the development of reliable and valid theory-based tests of cognitive functioning. Such assessments promise to be a potentially useful tool for evaluating federal judges to assess the impact of aging on their ability to perform at a level their positions deserve, perhaps to measure their competency to serve the public intelligently. It is proposed that public funding be made available to appoint a panel of experts to develop and validate an array of computerized cognitive tests to identify those justices who are at risk of cognitive impairment.", "In the last decades, modern medicine has evolved into a data-centered discipline, generating massive amounts of granular high-dimensional data exceeding human comprehension. With improved computational methods, machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) as tools for data processing and analysis are becoming more and more important. At the forefront of neuro-oncology and AI-research, the field of radiomics has emerged. Non-invasive assessments of quantitative radiological biomarkers mined from complex imaging characteristics across various applications are used to predict survival, discriminate between primary and secondary tumors, as well as between progression and pseudo-progression. In particular, the application of molecular phenotyping, envisioned in the field of radiogenomics, has gained popularity for both primary and secondary brain tumors. Although promising results have been obtained thus far, the lack of workflow standardization and availability of multicenter data remains challenging. The objective of this review is to provide an overview of novel applications of machine learning- and deep learning-based radiomics in primary and secondary brain tumors and their implications for future research in the field.", "Introduction: The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in medical imaging and radiotherapy has been met with both scepticism and excitement. However, clinical integration of AI is already well-underway. Many authors have recently reported on the AI knowledge and perceptions of radiologists/medical staff and students however there is a paucity of information regarding radiographers. Published literature agrees that AI is likely to have significant impact on radiology practice. As radiographers are at the forefront of radiology service delivery, an awareness of the current level of their perceived knowledge, skills, and confidence in AI is essential to identify any educational needs necessary for successful adoption into practice. Aim: The aim of this survey was to determine the perceived knowledge, skills, and confidence in AI amongst UK radiographers and highlight priorities for educational provisions to support a digital healthcare ecosystem. Methods: A survey was created on Qualtrics\u00ae and promoted via social media (Twitter\u00ae/LinkedIn\u00ae). This survey was open to all UK radiographers, including students and retired radiographers. Participants were recruited by convenience, snowball sampling. Demographic information was gathered as well as data on the perceived, self-reported, knowledge, skills, and confidence in AI of respondents. Insight into what the participants understand by the term \"AI\" was gained by means of a free text response. Quantitative analysis was performed using SPSS\u00ae and qualitative thematic analysis was performed on NVivo\u00ae. Results: Four hundred and eleven responses were collected (80% from diagnostic radiography and 20% from a radiotherapy background), broadly representative of the workforce distribution in the UK. Although many respondents stated that they understood the concept of AI in general (78.7% for diagnostic and 52.1% for therapeutic radiography respondents, respectively) there was a notable lack of sufficient knowledge of AI principles, understanding of AI terminology, skills, and confidence in the use of AI technology. Many participants, 57% of diagnostic and 49% radiotherapy respondents, do not feel adequately trained to implement AI in the clinical setting. Furthermore 52% and 64%, respectively, said they have not developed any skill in AI whilst 62% and 55%, respectively, stated that there is not enough AI training for radiographers. The majority of the respondents indicate that there is an urgent need for further education (77.4% of diagnostic and 73.9% of therapeutic radiographers feeling they have not had adequate training in AI), with many respondents stating that they had to educate themselves to gain some basic AI skills. Notable correlations between confidence in working with AI and gender, age, and highest qualification were reported. Conclusion: Knowledge of AI terminology, principles, and applications by healthcare practitioners is necessary for adoption and integration of AI applications. The results of this survey highlight the perceived lack of knowledge, skills, and confidence for radiographers in applying AI solutions but also underline the need for formalised education on AI to prepare the current and prospective workforce for the upcoming clinical integration of AI in healthcare, to safely and efficiently navigate a digital future. Focus should be given on different needs of learners depending on age, gender, and highest qualification to ensure optimal integration.", "Deep learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence that allows the computer to adopt and learn some new rules. Deep learning algorithms can identify images, objects, observations, texts, and other structures. In recent years, scene text recognition has inspired many researchers from the computer vision community, and still, it needs improvement because of the poor performance of existing scene recognition algorithms. This research paper proposed a novel approach for scene text recognition that integrates bidirectional LSTM and deep convolution neural networks. In the proposed method, first, the contour of the image is identified and then it is fed into the CNN. CNN is used to generate the ordered sequence of the features from the contoured image. The sequence of features is now coded using the Bi-LSTM. Bi-LSTM is a handy tool for extracting the features from the sequence of words. Hence, this paper combines the two powerful mechanisms for extracting the features from the image, and contour-based input image makes the recognition process faster, which makes this technique better compared to existing methods. The results of the proposed methodology are evaluated on MSRATD 50 dataset, SVHN dataset, vehicle number plate dataset, SVT dataset, and random datasets, and the accuracy is 95.22%, 92.25%, 96.69%, 94.58%, and 98.12%, respectively. According to quantitative and qualitative analysis, this approach is more promising in terms of accuracy and precision rate.", "Chatbot is a timely topic applied in various fields, including medicine and health care, for human-like knowledge transfer and communication. Machine learning, a subset of artificial intelligence, has been proven particularly applicable in health care, with the ability for complex dialog management and conversational flexibility.\nThis review article aims to report on the recent advances and current trends in chatbot technology in medicine. A brief historical overview, along with the developmental progress and design characteristics, is first introduced. The focus will be on cancer therapy, with in-depth discussions and examples of diagnosis, treatment, monitoring, patient support, workflow efficiency, and health promotion. In addition, this paper will explore the limitations and areas of concern, highlighting ethical, moral, security, technical, and regulatory standards and evaluation issues to explain the hesitancy in implementation.\nA search of the literature published in the past 20 years was conducted using the IEEE Xplore, PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and OVID databases. The screening of chatbots was guided by the open-access Botlist directory for health care components and further divided according to the following criteria: diagnosis, treatment, monitoring, support, workflow, and health promotion.\nEven after addressing these issues and establishing the safety or efficacy of chatbots, human elements in health care will not be replaceable. Therefore, chatbots have the potential to be integrated into clinical practice by working alongside health practitioners to reduce costs, refine workflow efficiencies, and improve patient outcomes. Other applications in pandemic support, global health, and education are yet to be fully explored.\nFurther research and interdisciplinary collaboration could advance this technology to dramatically improve the quality of care for patients, rebalance the workload for clinicians, and revolutionize the practice of medicine.", "This experimental study was designed using pretest, posttest, follow-up, and control group models to explore the effect of a structured education program on adolescents' psychological resilience and emotional intelligence level.\nThis study was conducted on 70 students at a high school in Turkey. A total of 36 students were assigned to the intervention group and 34 students to the control group. Data were collected using the Adolescent Information Form, Resilience Scale (RS), and Emotional Intelligence Evaluation Scale (EIES). The scales were administered in the intervention group before initializing the education program, who later received a 7-week education program. One month after the administration of the education program, the scales were again administered during follow-up.\nIt was found that the education program improved and increased adolescents' psychological resilience and total emotional intelligence level despite not being significant (p\u00a0>\u00a00.05). During the follow-up, adolescents in the intervention group demonstrated an important difference in follow-up scores in the optimism and communication subdimensions of the RS compared to that in the posttest scores, and the intervention group had a higher average total score in the EIES compared to that in students in the control group (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05).\nOur results suggest that the training program has positive effects on improving adolescents' psychological resilience and emotional intelligence levels, especially in the long run, which needs to be developed and applied in different samples.", "Industry 4.0 has been a hot topic in recent years. The process of integrating Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Internet of Things (IoT) technology, will become the trend in future construction of smart factories. In the past, smart factories were developed around the concept of the Flexible Manufacturing System (FMS). Most parts of the quality management process still needed to be implemented by Automated Optical Inspection (AOI) methods which required human resources and time to perform second stage testing. Screening standards also resulted in the elimination of about 30% of the products. In this study, we sort and analyze several Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (R-CNN) and YOLO models that are currently more advanced and widely used, analyze the methods and development problems of the various models, and propose a suitable real-time image recognition model and architecture suitable for Integrated Circuit Board (ICB) in manufacturing process. The goal of the first stage of this study is to collect and use different types of ICBs as model training data sets, and establish a preliminary image recognition model that can classify and predict different types of ICBs based on different feature points. The second stage explores image augmentation fusion and optimization methods. The data augmentation method used in this study can reach an average accuracy of 96.53%. In the final stage, there is discussion of the applicability of the model to detect and recognize the ICB directionality in <1 s with a 98% accuracy rate to meet the real-time requirements of smart manufacturing. Accurate and instant object image recognition in the smart manufacturing process can save manpower required for testing, improve equipment effectiveness, and increase both the production capacity and the yield rate of the production line. The proposed model improves the overall manufacturing process.", "As poor diet quality is a significant risk factor for multiple noncommunicable diseases prevalent in the United States, it is important that methods be developed to accurately capture eating behavior data. There is growing interest in the use of ecological momentary assessments to collect data on health behaviors and their predictors on a micro timescale (at different points within or across days); however, documenting eating behaviors remains a challenge.\nThis pilot study (N=48) aims to examine the feasibility-usability and acceptability-of using smartphone-captured and crowdsource-labeled images to document eating behaviors in real time.\nParticipants completed the Block Fat/Sugar/Fruit/Vegetable Screener to provide a measure of their typical eating behavior, then took pictures of their meals and snacks and answered brief survey questions for 7 consecutive days using a commercially available smartphone app. Participant acceptability was determined through a questionnaire regarding their experiences administered at the end of the study. The images of meals and snacks were uploaded to Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk), a crowdsourcing distributed human intelligence platform, where 2 Workers assigned a count of food categories to the images (fruits, vegetables, salty snacks, and sweet snacks). The agreement among MTurk Workers was assessed, and weekly food counts were calculated and compared with the Screener responses.\nParticipants reported little difficulty in uploading photographs and remembered to take photographs most of the time. Crowdsource-labeled images (n=1014) showed moderate agreement between the MTurk Worker responses for vegetables (688/1014, 67.85%) and high agreement for all other food categories (871/1014, 85.89% for fruits; 847/1014, 83.53% for salty snacks, and 833/1014, 81.15% for sweet snacks). There were no significant differences in weekly food consumption between the food images and the Block Screener, suggesting that this approach may measure typical eating behaviors as accurately as traditional methods, with lesser burden on participants.\nOur approach offers a potentially time-efficient and cost-effective strategy for capturing eating events in real time.", "Primary malignancies in adult brains are globally fatal. Computer vision, especially recent developments in artificial intelligence (AI), have created opportunities to automatically characterize and diagnose tumor lesions in the brain. AI approaches have provided scores of unprecedented accuracy in different image analysis tasks, including differentiating tumor-containing brains from healthy brains. AI models, however, perform as a black box, concealing the rational interpretations that are an essential step towards translating AI imaging tools into clinical routine. An explainable AI approach aims to visualize the high-level features of trained models or integrate into the training process. This study aims to evaluate the performance of selected deep-learning algorithms on localizing tumor lesions and distinguishing the lesion from healthy regions in magnetic resonance imaging contrasts. Despite a significant correlation between classification and lesion localization accuracy (R = 0.46, p = 0.005), the known AI algorithms, examined in this study, classify some tumor brains based on other non-relevant features. The results suggest that explainable AI approaches can develop an intuition for model interpretability and may play an important role in the performance evaluation of deep learning models. Developing explainable AI approaches will be an essential tool to improve human-machine interactions and assist in the selection of optimal training methods.", "In the context of economic globalization and digitization, the current financial field is in an unprecedented complex situation. The methods and means to deal with this complexity are developing towards image intelligence. This paper takes financial prediction as the starting point, selects the artificial neural network in the intelligent algorithm and optimizes the algorithm, forecasts through the improved multilayer neural network, and compares it with the traditional neural network. Through comparison, it is found that the prediction success rate of the improved genetic multilayer neural network increases with the increase of the dimension of the input image data. This shows that, by adding more technical indicators as the input of the combined network, the prediction efficiency of the improved genetic multilayer neural network can be further improved and the advantage of computing speed can be maintained.", "Bone is the most common site of distant metastasis from malignant tumors, with the highest prevalence observed in breast and prostate cancers. Such bone metastases (BM) cause many painful skeletal-related events, such as severe bone pain, pathological fractures, spinal cord compression, and hypercalcemia, with adverse effects on life quality. Many bone-targeting agents developed based on the current understanding of BM onset's molecular mechanisms dull these adverse effects. However, only a few studies investigated potential predictors of high risk for developing BM, despite such knowledge being critical for early interventions to prevent or delay BM. This work proposes a computational network-based pipeline that incorporates a ML/DL component to predict BM development. Based on the proposed pipeline we constructed several machine learning models. The deep neural network (DNN) model exhibited the highest prediction accuracy (AUC of 92.11%) using the top 34 featured genes ranked by betweenness centrality scores. We further used an entirely separate, \"external\" TCGA dataset to evaluate the robustness of this DNN model and achieved sensitivity of 85%, specificity of 80%, positive predictive value of 78.10%, negative predictive value of 80%, and AUC of 85.78%. The result shows the models' way of learning allowed it to zoom in on the featured genes that provide the added benefit of the model displaying generic capabilities, that is, to predict BM for samples from different primary sites. Furthermore, existing experimental evidence provides confidence that about 50% of the 34 hub genes have BM-related functionality, which suggests that these common genetic markers provide vital insight about BM drivers. These findings may prompt the transformation of such a method into an artificial intelligence (AI) diagnostic tool and direct us towards mechanisms that underlie metastasis to bone events.", "Much has been invested in big data and artificial intelligence-based solutions for healthcare. However, few applications have been implemented in clinical practice. Early economic evaluations can help to improve decision-making by developers of analytics underlying these solutions aiming to increase the likelihood of successful implementation, but recommendations about their use are lacking. The aim of this study was to develop and apply a framework that positions best practice methods for economic evaluations alongside development of analytics, thereby enabling developers to identify barriers to success and to select analytics worth further investments.\nThe framework was developed using literature, recommendations for economic evaluations and by applying the framework to use cases (chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), intensive care, diabetes). First, the feasibility of developing clinically relevant analytics was assessed and critical barriers to successful development and implementation identified. Economic evaluations were then used to determine critical thresholds and guide investment decisions.\nWhen using the framework to assist decision-making of developers of analytics, continuing development was not always feasible or worthwhile. Developing analytics for progressive CLL and diabetes was clinically relevant but not feasible with the data available. Alternatively, developing analytics for newly diagnosed CLL patients was feasible but continuing development was not considered worthwhile because the high drug costs made it economically unattractive for potential users. Alternatively, in the intensive care unit, analytics reduced mortality and per-patient costs when used to identify infections (-\u20090.5%,\u2009-\u2009\u20ac886) and to improve patient-ventilator interaction (-\u20093%,\u2009-\u2009\u20ac264). Both analytics have the potential to save money but the potential benefits of analytics that identify infections strongly depend on infection rate; a higher rate implies greater cost-savings.\nWe present a framework that stimulates efficiency of development of analytics for big data and artificial intelligence-based solutions by selecting those applications of analytics for which development is feasible and worthwhile. For these applications, results from early economic evaluations can be used to guide investment decisions and identify critical requirements.", "Karyotype analysis has a great impact on the diagnosis, treatment and prognosis in hematologic neoplasms. The identification and characterization of chromosomes is a challenging process and needs experienced personal. Artificial intelligence provides novel support tools. However, their safe and reliable application in diagnostics needs to be evaluated. Here, we present a novel laboratory approach to identify chromosomes in cancer cells using a convolutional neural network (CNN). The CNN identified the correct chromosome class for 98.8% of chromosomes, which led to a time saving of 42% for the karyotyping workflow. These results demonstrate that the CNN has potential application value in chromosome classification of hematologic neoplasms. This study contributes to the development of an automatic karyotyping platform.", "Asian American and Pacific Islanders (AAPI) are the fastest growing racial minority in the United States. With more than 40 subgroups in the diaspora, 1 in 10 American youths will be of Asian origin by 2060. Racism-defined as prejudice, discrimination or antagonism on the basis of membership in a particular racial or ethnic group-is increasingly recognized as a public health crisis.1 Anti-AAPI racism, such as unequal resource distribution in housing, education, employment, and health care, exclusionary naturalization policies and violence1,2 (eg, Pacific coast riots, Japanese Americans' internment during World War II, recent Atlanta shootings) is well documented. Anti-AAPI microaggressions-that is, the subtle, sometimes unintentional forms of racism such as characterizations as perpetual foreigners, ascriptions of intelligence, oversexualization of women, invalidated interethnic differences, and model minority myth-are common. The model minority stereotype dismisses real struggles1 and pits AAPIs against other racial minorities. Despite the proud tradition of AAPI activism , discrimination is often endured in silence, probably stemming from cultural values of stoicism and harmony, and tacit societal acceptance of racism.3.", "For unknown reasons, females outperform males on tests of psychomotor processing speed (PS), such as the Coding and Symbol Search subtests of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale.\nIn the present study, the effects of intelligence, memory, personality, fine motor speed, gross motor dexterity, height, weight, age, sex, and education on psychomotor processing speed were studied in an outpatient sample (n\u2009=\u2009130).\nModerate (r\u2009>\u2009.40) correlations were found between PS and verbal reasoning, nonverbal reasoning, verbal memory, and fine motor speed. Weak (r\u2009>\u2009.20) correlations were found between PS and gross motor dexterity, extraversion, education, weight, and sex. Females outperformed males in PS and in fine motor speed. Stepwise linear regression analysis indicated nonverbal reasoning, fine motor speed, and sex as independent predictors of PS.\nOne interpretation of the results is that the factors underlying sex differences in processing speed are not psychological but neurological or physiological in nature and therefore a wider variety of measures from these disciplines are needed for further studies. For clinical assessment purposes, psychological tests should preferably provide different norms for male and female PS scores.", "Nowadays, there are different kinds of public knowledge bases for cyber security vulnerability and threat intelligence which can be used for IoT security threat analysis. However, the heterogeneity of these knowledge bases and the complexity of the IoT environments make network security situation awareness and threat assessment difficult. In this paper, we integrate vulnerabilities, weaknesses, affected platforms, tactics, attack techniques, and attack patterns into a coherent set of links. In addition, we propose an IoT security ontology model, namely, the IoT Security Threat Ontology (IoTSTO), to describe the elements of IoT security threats and design inference rules for threat analysis. This IoTSTO expands the current knowledge domain of cyber security ontology modeling. In the IoTSTO model, the proposed multi-source knowledge reasoning method can perform the following tasks: assess the threats of the IoT environment, automatically infer mitigations, and separate IoT nodes that are subject to specific threats. The method above provides support to security managers in their deployment of security solutions. This paper completes the association of current public knowledge bases for IoT security and solves the semantic heterogeneity of multi-source knowledge. In this paper, we reveal the scope of public knowledge bases and their interrelationships through the multi-source knowledge reasoning method for IoT security. In conclusion, the paper provides a unified, extensible, and reusable method for IoT security analysis and decision making.", "Resistive random access memories (RRAMs) based on the electrochemical metallization mechanism (ECM) have potential applications in high-density data storage and efficient neuromorphic computing. However, the high variability of ECM devices still hinders their application in artificial intelligence owing to the random formation of conductive filaments (CFs). Here, we demonstrate 2D covalent organic framework (COF) RRAM with electroforming-free resistive switching behavior, low spatial/temporal variations, and excellent retention capability up to 105 s. The one-dimensional channels of the oriented COF-5 film can not only confine the shape of filaments but also modulate the transition direction of Ag ions. Moreover, alcohol vapors could activate the device to achieve gas-mediated multilevel resistive switching since COF materials can absorb small molecules through host guest interactions to vary the conductivity. An alcohol gas recognition system constructed by integrating the COF RRAM as a sensor and filter part with the k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm as a classifier was demonstrated with a recognition accuracy of 87.2%. Furthermore, the effect of alcohol inhibition stimulation in the human nervous system is successfully emulated by the COF RRAM.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) comprises computational models that mimic the human brain to perform various diagnostic tasks in clinical practice. The aim of this scoping review was to systematically analyze the AI algorithms and models used in endodontics and identify the source quality and type of evidence.\nA literature search was conducted in October 2020 to identify the relevant literature in English language in the 4 major health sciences databases, ie, MEDLINE, Dentistry & Oral Science, CINAHL Plus, and Cochrane Library. Our review questions were the following: what are the different AI algorithms and models used in endodontics?, what are the datasets being used?, what type of performance metrics were reported?, and what diagnostic performance measures were used?. The quality of the included studies was evaluated by a modified Quality Assessment of Studies of Diagnostic Accuracy risk (QUADAS) tool.\nOut of 300 studies, 12 articles met our inclusion criteria and were subjected to final analysis. Among the included studies, 6 studies focused on periapical pathology, and 3 studies investigated vertical root fractures. Most studies (n\u00a0=\u00a010) used neural networks, among which convolutional neural networks were commonly used. The datasets that were mostly studied were radiographs. Out of 12 studies, only 3 studies achieved a high score according to the modified QUADAS tool.\nAI models had acceptable performance, ie, accuracy >90% in executing various diagnostic tasks. The scientific reporting of AI-related research is irregular. The endodontic community needs to implement recommended guidelines to improve the weaknesses in the current planning and reporting of AI-related research to improve its scientific vigor.", "Cells survive and proliferate through complex interactions among diverse molecules across multiomics layers. Conventional experimental approaches for identifying these interactions have built a firm foundation for molecular biology, but their scalability is gradually becoming inadequate compared to the rapid accumulation of multiomics data measured by high-throughput technologies. Therefore, the need for data-driven computational modeling of interactions within cells has been highlighted in recent years. The complexity of multiomics interactions is primarily due to their nonlinearity. That is, their accurate modeling requires intricate conditional dependencies, synergies, or antagonisms between considered genes or proteins, which retard experimental validations. Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, including deep learning models, are optimal choices for handling complex nonlinear relationships between features that are scalable and produce large amounts of data. Thus, they have great potential for modeling multiomics interactions. Although there exist many AI-driven models for computational biology applications, relatively few explicitly incorporate the prior knowledge within model architectures or training procedures. Such guidance of models by domain knowledge will greatly reduce the amount of data needed to train models and constrain their vast expressive powers to focus on the biologically relevant space. Therefore, it can enhance a model's interpretability, reduce spurious interactions, and prove its validity and utility. Thus, to facilitate further development of knowledge-guided AI technologies for the modeling of multiomics interactions, here we review representative bioinformatics applications of deep learning models for multiomics interactions developed to date by categorizing them by guidance mode.", "In view of the demand of location awareness in a special complex environment, for an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) airborne multi base-station semi-passive positioning system, the hybrid positioning solutions and optimized site layout in the positioning system can effectively improve the positioning accuracy for a specific region. In this paper, the geometric dilution of precision (GDOP) formula of a time difference of arrival (TDOA) and angles of arrival (AOA) hybrid location algorithm is deduced. Mayfly optimization algorithm (MOA) which is a new swarm intelligence optimization algorithm is introduced, and a method to find the optimal station of the UAV airborne multiple base station's semi-passive positioning system using MOA is proposed. The simulation and analysis of the optimization of the different number of base stations, compared with other station layout methods, such as particle swarm optimization (PSO), genetic algorithm (GA), and artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm. MOA is less likely to fall into local optimum, and the error of regional target positioning is reduced. By simulating the deployment of four base stations and five base stations in various situations, MOA can achieve a better deployment effect. The dynamic station configuration capability of the multi-station semi-passive positioning system has been improved with the UAV.", "Machine learning obtains good accuracy in determining the number of contributors (NOC) in short tandem repeat (STR) mixture DNA profiles. However, the models used so far are not understandable to users as they only output a prediction without any reasoning for that conclusion. Therefore, we leverage techniques from the field of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to help users understand why specific predictions are made. Where previous attempts at explainability for NOC estimation have relied upon using simpler, more understandable models that achieve lower accuracy, we use techniques that can be applied to any machine learning model. Our explanations incorporate SHAP values and counterfactual examples for each prediction into a single visualization. Existing methods for generating counterfactuals focus on uncorrelated features. This makes them inappropriate for the highly correlated features derived from STR data for NOC estimation, as these techniques simulate combinations of features that could not have resulted from an STR profile. For this reason, we have constructed a new counterfactual method, Realistic Counterfactuals (ReCo), which generates realistic counterfactual explanations for correlated data. We show that ReCo outperforms state-of-the-art methods on traditional metrics, as well as on a novel realism score. A user evaluation of the visualization shows positive opinions of end-users, which is ultimately the most appropriate metric in assessing explanations for real-world settings.", "To provide a narrative review of original articles on imaging of osteoarthritis (OA) published between January 1, 2020 and March 31, 2021, with a special focus on imaging of inflammation, imaging of bone, cartilage and bone-cartilage interactions, imaging of peri-articular tissues, imaging scoring methods for OA, and artificial intelligence (AI) applied to OA imaging.\nThe Embase, Pubmed, Medline, Cochrane databases were searched for original research articles in the English language on human, in vivo, imaging of OA published between January 1, 2020 and March 31, 2021. Search terms related to osteoarthritis combined with all imaging modalities and artificial intelligence were applied. A selection of articles reporting on one of the focus topics was discussed further.\nThe search resulted in 651 articles, of which 214 were deemed relevant to human OA imaging. Among the articles included, the knee joint (69%) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (52%) were the predominant anatomical area and imaging modality studied. There were also a substantial number of papers (n\u00a0=\u00a046) reporting on AI applications in the field of OA imaging.\nImaging continues to play an important role in the assessment of OA. Recent advances in OA imaging include quantitative, non-contrast, and hybrid imaging techniques for improved characterization of multiple tissue processes in OA. In addition, an increasing effort in AI techniques is undertaken to enhance OA imaging acquisition and analysis.", "Adverse drug events (ADEs) represent one of the most prevalent types of health-care-related harm, and there is substantial room for improvement in the way that they are currently predicted and detected. We conducted a scoping review to identify key use cases in which artificial intelligence (AI) could be leveraged to reduce the frequency of ADEs. We focused on modern machine learning techniques and natural language processing. 78 articles were included in the scoping review. Studies were heterogeneous and applied various AI techniques covering a wide range of medications and ADEs. We identified several key use cases in which AI could contribute to reducing the frequency and consequences of ADEs, through prediction to prevent ADEs and early detection to mitigate the effects. Most studies (73 [94%] of 78) assessed technical algorithm performance, and few studies evaluated the use of AI in clinical settings. Most articles (58 [74%] of 78) were published within the past 5 years, highlighting an emerging area of study. Availability of new types of data, such as genetic information, and access to unstructured clinical notes might further advance the field.", "In recent studies, test-score increases have been shown in rule-based intelligence test tasks, such as number series, after watching a corresponding video tutorial. An open question remains regarding the mechanisms involved. Specifically, taking notes to describe the relations between numbers might be linked to test scores, and is hypothesized to mediate the effect of a number series video tutorial on number series test scores. Therefore, an experimental group (EG) watching a number series video tutorial (n = 58) was compared with a control group (CG) watching an irrelevant tutorial (n = 52) before working on number series items. Results revealed higher number series scores in the EG than the CG (d = .48), more items with provided notes in the EG than in the CG (d = .41), and substantial correlations between the number of items with notes and the number series sum scores in both groups (EG: r = .66; CG: r = .75). The effect of the video tutorial on the number series sum score was mediated by the number of items with notes (indirect effect = 3.41, SE = 1.74). Theoretical and practical implications as well as future research directions are discussed.", "SARS-CoV2 pandemic exposed the limitations of artificial intelligence based medical imaging systems. Earlier in the pandemic, the absence of sufficient training data prevented effective deep learning (DL) solutions for the diagnosis of COVID-19 based on X-Ray data. Here, addressing the lacunae in existing literature and algorithms with the paucity of initial training data; we describe CovBaseAI, an explainable tool using an ensemble of three DL models and an expert decision system (EDS) for COVID-Pneumonia diagnosis, trained entirely on pre-COVID-19 datasets. The performance and explainability of CovBaseAI was primarily validated on two independent datasets. Firstly, 1401 randomly selected CxR from an Indian quarantine center to assess effectiveness in excluding radiological COVID-Pneumonia requiring higher care. Second, curated dataset; 434 RT-PCR positive cases and 471 non-COVID/Normal historical scans, to assess performance in advanced medical settings. CovBaseAI had an accuracy of 87% with a negative predictive value of 98% in the quarantine-center data. However, sensitivity was 0.66-0.90 taking RT-PCR/radiologist opinion as ground truth. This work provides new insights on the usage of EDS with DL methods and the ability of algorithms to confidently predict COVID-Pneumonia while reinforcing the established learning; that benchmarking based on RT-PCR may not serve as reliable ground truth in radiological diagnosis. Such tools can pave the path for multi-modal high throughput detection of COVID-Pneumonia in screening and referral.", "Recent studies have revealed great functional and structural heterogeneity in the ribbon-type synapses at the basolateral pole of the isopotential inner hair cell (IHC). This feature is believed to be critical for audition over a wide dynamic range, but whether the spatial gradient of ribbon morphology is fine-tuned in each IHC and how the mitochondrial network is organized to meet local energy demands of synaptic transmission remain unclear. By means of three-dimensional electron microscopy and artificial intelligence-based algorithms, we demonstrated the cell-wide structural quantification of ribbons and mitochondria in mature mid-cochlear IHCs of mice. We found that adjacent IHCs in staggered pairs differ substantially in cell body shape and ribbon morphology gradient as well as mitochondrial organization. Moreover, our analysis argues for a location-specific arrangement of correlated ribbon and mitochondrial function at the basolateral IHC pole.", "An accurate and rapid diagnosis is crucial for the appropriate treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis (TB). This study aims to develop an artificial intelligence (AI)-based fully automated CT image analysis system for detection, diagnosis, and burden quantification of pulmonary TB.\nFrom December 2007 to September 2020, 892 chest CT scans from pathogen-confirmed TB patients were retrospectively included. A deep learning-based cascading framework was connected to create a processing pipeline. For training and validation of the model, 1921 lesions were manually labeled, classified according to six categories of critical imaging features, and visually scored regarding lesion involvement as the ground truth. A \"TB score\" was calculated based on a network-activation map to quantitively assess the disease burden. Independent testing datasets from two additional hospitals (dataset 2, n = 99; dataset 3, n = 86) and the NIH TB Portals (n = 171) were used to externally validate the performance of the AI model.\nCT scans of 526 participants (mean age, 48.5 \u00b1 16.5 years; 206 women) were analyzed. The lung lesion detection subsystem yielded a mean average precision of the validation cohort of 0.68. The overall classification accuracy of six pulmonary critical imaging findings indicative of TB of the independent datasets was 81.08-91.05%. A moderate to strong correlation was demonstrated between the AI model-quantified TB score and the radiologist-estimated CT score.\nThe proposed end-to-end AI system based on chest CT can achieve human-level diagnostic performance for early detection and optimal clinical management of patients with pulmonary TB.\n\u2022 Deep learning allows automatic detection, diagnosis, and evaluation of pulmonary tuberculosis. \u2022 Artificial intelligence helps clinicians to assess patients with tuberculosis. \u2022 Pulmonary tuberculosis disease activity and treatment management can be improved.", "Research related to blockchain is rapidly gaining importance in the higher education. This opportunity collaborates with a proposal for a review of papers on the main blockchain topic. The bibliometric analysis included 61 peer-reviewed articles published in the Scopus database during the period of 2016 to 2021. This paper offers the identification of gaps in the literature enabling studies on the subject in higher education. The article identifies the main applications of blockchain technology in higher education around the world, as well as suggests future investigations. For further scientific investigation, we propose the operationalization of each of the researched approaches, especially combining the blockchain relationship, artificial intelligence, digital innovation, digital maturity, and customer experience in higher education.", "Despite health care advances, artificial intelligence and government interventions aiming to improve the health and wellbeing of citizens, huge disparities and failures in care provision exist. This is demonstrated by the rising number of medical errors, increase in readmission rates and mortality rates, and the failure of many health systems to successfully cope with events, such as pandemics and natural disasters. This shortfall is in part because of the complexity of the health care system, the interconnectedness of various parts of service, funding models, the complexity of patients' conditions, patient and carer needs, and the clinical processes needed for patients via multiple providers.\nThe objective of this paper is to describe the use of system thinking methodologies to address complex problems such as those in the public health and health services domains.\nA description of the system thinking methodology and its associated methods including causal loop diagrams, social network analysis and soft system methodology are described with examples in the health care setting.\nThere are various models of knowledge translation that have been employed including the Joanna Briggs Institute model of implementation of evidence into practice, the triple C, and the Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services. However, many of these models are neither scalable nor sustainable, and are most effective for localized projects implemented by trained clinicians and champions in relevant settings.System thinking is essentially a modelling process, which aims to create opportunities for change via an appreciation of perspective, and recognition that complex problems are a result of interconnected factors. The article argues that systems thinking applications need to move beyond that of addressing complex health issues pertaining to a population, and rather consider complex problems surrounding the delivery of high-quality health care.\nIt is important that methods to implement systems thinking methodologies in health care settings are developed and tested.", "To train artificial intelligence (AI) systems on radiology images, an image labeling step is necessary. Labeling for radiology images usually involves a human radiologist manually drawing a (polygonal) shape onto the image and attaching a word to it. As datasets are typically large, this task is repetitive, time-consuming, error-prone, and expensive. The AI methodology of active learning (AL) can assist human labelers by continuously sorting the unlabeled images in order of information gain and thus getting the labeler always to label the most informative image next. We find that after about 10%, depending on the dataset, of the images in a realistic dataset are labeled, virtually all the information content has been learnt and the remaining images can be automatically labeled. These images can then be checked by the radiologist, which is far easier and faster to do. In this way, the entire dataset is labeled with much less human effort. We introduce AL in detail and expose the effectiveness using three real-life datasets. We contribute five distinct elements to the standard AL workflow creating an advanced methodology.", "Highly accurate detection of intracranial hemorrhages (ICH) on head computed tomography (HCT) scans can prove challenging at high-volume centers. This study aimed to determine the number of additional ICHs detected by an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm and to evaluate reasons for erroneous results at a level I trauma center with teleradiology services.\nIn a retrospective multi-center cohort study, consecutive emergency non-contrast HCT scans were analyzed by a commercially available ICH detection software (AIDOC, Tel Aviv, Israel). Discrepancies between AI analysis and initial radiology report (RR) were reviewed by a blinded neuroradiologist to determine the number of additional ICHs detected and evaluate reasons leading to errors.\n4946 HCT (05/2020-09/2020) from 18 hospitals were included in the analysis. 205 reports (4.1%) were classified as hemorrhages by both radiology report and AI. Out of a total of 162 (3.3%) discrepant reports, 62 were confirmed as hemorrhages by the reference neuroradiologist. 33 ICHs were identified exclusively via RRs. The AI algorithm detected an additional 29 instances of ICH, missed 12.4% of ICH and overcalled 1.9%; RRs missed 10.9% of ICHs and overcalled 0.2%. Many of the ICHs missed by the AI algorithm were located in the subarachnoid space (42.4%) and under the calvaria (48.5%). 85% of ICHs missed by RRs occurred outside of regular working-hours. Calcifications (39.3%), beam-hardening artifacts (18%), tumors (15.7%), and blood vessels (7.9%) were the most common reasons for AI overcalls. ICH size, image quality, and primary examiner experience were not found to be significantly associated with likelihood of incorrect AI results.\nComplementing human expertise with AI resulted in a 12.2% increase in ICH detection. The AI algorithm overcalled 1.9% HCT.\nGerman Clinical Trials Register (DRKS-ID: DRKS00023593).", "COVID-19 has caused a worldwide pandemic, making the early detection of the virus crucial. We present an approach for the determination of COVID-19 infection based on breath analysis.\nA high sensitivity mass spectrometer was combined with artificial intelligence and used to develop a method for the identification of COVID-19 in human breath within seconds. A set of 1137 positive and negative subjects from different age groups, collected in two periods from two hospitals in the USA, from 26 August, 2020 until 15 September, 2020 and from 11 September, 2020 until 11 November, 2020, was used for the method development. The subjects exhaled in a Tedlar bag, and the exhaled breath samples were subsequently analyzed using a Proton Transfer Reaction Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometer (PTR-ToF-MS). The produced mass spectra were introduced to a series of machine learning models. 70% of the data was used for these sub-models' training and 30% was used for testing.\nA set of 340 samples, 95 positives and 245 negatives, was used for the testing. The combined models successfully predicted 77 out of the 95 samples as positives and 199 out of the 245 samples as negatives. The overall accuracy of the model was 81.2%. Since over 50% of the total positive samples belonged to the age group of over 55 years old, the performance of the model in this category was also separately evaluated on 339 subjects (170 negative and 169 positive). The model correctly identified 166 out of the 170 negatives and 164 out of the 169 positives. The model accuracy in this case was 97.3%.\nThe results showed that this method for the identification of COVID-19 infection is a promising tool, which can give fast and accurate results.", "The advent of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology, which allows to transform one cell type into another, holds the promise to produce therapeutic cells and organs on demand. Realization of this objective is contingent on the ability to demonstrate quality and safety of the cellular product for its intended use. Bottlenecks and backlogs to the clinical use of iPSCs have been fully outlined and a need has emerged for safer and standardized protocols to trigger cell reprogramming and functional differentiation. Amidst great challenges, in particular associated with lengthy culture time and laborious cell characterization, a demand for faster and more accurate methods for the validation of cell identity and function at different stages of the iPSC manufacturing process has risen. Artificial intelligence-based methods are proving helpful for these complex tasks and might revolutionize the way iPSCs are managed to create surrogate cells and organs. Here, we briefly review recent progress in artificial intelligence approaches for evaluation of iPSCs and their derivatives in experimental studies.", "COVID-19 is mainly considered an \"adult pandemic,\" but it also has strong implications for children and consequently for pediatric anesthesia. Despite the lethality of SARS-CoV-2 infection being directly correlated with age, children have equally experienced the negative impacts of this pandemic. In fact, the spectrum of COVID-19\u00a0symptoms among children ranges from very mild to those resembling adults, but may also present as a multisystemic inflammatory syndrome. Moreover, the vast majority of children might be affected by asymptomatic or pauci-symptomatic infection making them the \"perfect\" carriers for spreading the disease in the community. Beyond the clinical manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the COVID-19 pandemic may ultimately have catastrophic health and socioeconomic consequences for children and adolescents, which are yet to be defined. The aim of this narrative review is to highlight how COVID-19 pandemic has affected and changed the pediatric anesthesia practice and which lessons are to be learned in case of a future \"pandemic.\" In particular, the rapid evolution and dissemination of research and clinical findings have forced the scientific community to adapt and alter clinical practice on an unseen and pragmatic manner. Equally, implementation of new platforms, techniques, and devices together with artificial intelligence and large-scale collaborative efforts may present a giant step for mankind. The valuable lessons of this pandemic will ultimately translate into new treatments modalities for various diseases but will also have the potential for safety improvement and better quality of care. However, this pandemic has revealed the vulnerability and deficiencies of our health-care system. If not addressed properly, we may end up with a tsunami of burnout and compassionate fatigue among health-care professionals. Pediatric anesthesia and critical care staff are no exceptions.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) technology is widely applied in different medical fields, including the diagnosis of various diseases on the basis of facial phenotypes, but there is no evaluation or quantitative synthesis regarding the performance of artificial intelligence. Here, for the first time, we summarized and quantitatively analyzed studies on the diagnosis of heterogeneous diseases on the basis on facial features. In pooled data from 20 systematically identified studies involving 7 single diseases and 12,557 subjects, quantitative random-effects models revealed a pooled sensitivity of 89% (95% CI 82% to 93%) and a pooled specificity of 92% (95% CI 87% to 95%). A new index, the facial recognition intensity (FRI), was established to describe the complexity of the association of diseases with facial phenotypes. Meta-regression revealed the important contribution of FRI to heterogeneous diagnostic accuracy (p = 0.021), and a similar result was found in subgroup analyses (p = 0.003). An appropriate increase in the training size and the use of deep learning models helped to improve the diagnostic accuracy for diseases with low FRI, although no statistically significant association was found between accuracy and photographic resolution, training size, AI architecture, and number of diseases. In addition, a novel hypothesis is proposed for universal rules in AI performance, providing a new idea that could be explored in other AI applications.", "The management of retinal diseases relies heavily on digital imaging data, including optical coherence tomography (OCT) and fluorescein angiography (FA). Targeted feature extraction and the objective quantification of features provide important opportunities in biomarker discovery, disease burden assessment, and predicting treatment response. Additional important advantages include increased objectivity in interpretation, longitudinal tracking, and ability to incorporate computational models to create automated diagnostic and clinical decision support systems. Advances in computational technology, including deep learning and radiomics, open new doors for developing an imaging phenotype that may provide in-depth personalized disease characterization and enhance opportunities in precision medicine. In this review, we summarize current quantitative and radiomic imaging biomarkers described in the literature for age-related macular degeneration and diabetic eye disease using imaging modalities such as OCT, FA, and OCT angiography (OCTA). Various approaches used to identify and extract these biomarkers that utilize artificial intelligence and deep learning are also summarized in this review. These quantifiable biomarkers and automated approaches have unleashed new frontiers of personalized medicine where treatments are tailored, based on patient-specific longitudinally trackable biomarkers, and response monitoring can be achieved with a high degree of accuracy.", "Hyperforin, a major bioactive constituent of Hypericum concentration, is impacted by various phenological phases and soil characteristics. We aimed to design a model predicting hyperforin content in Hypericum perforatum based on different ecological and phenological conditions. We employed artificial intelligence modeling techniques including multilayer perceptron (MLP), radial basis function (RBF), and support vector machine (SVM) to examine the factors critical in predicting hyperforin content. We found that the MLP model (R 2\u00a0=\u2009.9) is the most suitable and precise model compared with RBF (R 2\u00a0=\u2009.81) and SVM (R 2\u00a0=\u2009.74) in predicting hyperforin in H.\u00a0perforatum based on ecological conditions, plant growth, and soil features. Moreover, phenological stages, organic carbon, altitude, and total N are detected in sensitivity analysis as the main factors that have a considerable impact on hyperforin content. We also report that the developed graphical user interface would be adaptable for key stakeholders including producers, manufacturers, analytical laboratory managers, and pharmacognosists.", "First, let me say that I am honored to take on the role of Editor in Chief at the Journal of Intelligence [...].", "Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) with computerized imaging analysis is attracting the attention of clinicians, in particular for its potential applications in improving cancer diagnosis. This review aims to investigate the contribution of radiomics and AI on the radiological preoperative assessment of patients with uterine sarcomas (USs).\nOur literature review involved a systematic search conducted in the last ten years about diagnosis, staging and treatments with radiomics and AI in USs. The protocol was drafted according to the systematic review and meta-analysis preferred reporting project (PRISMA-P) and was registered in the PROSPERO database (CRD42021253535).\nThe initial search identified 754 articles; of these, six papers responded to the characteristics required for the revision and were included in the final analysis. The predominant technique tested was magnetic resonance imaging. The analyzed studies revealed that even though sometimes complex models included AI-related algorithms, they are still too complex for translation into clinical practice. Furthermore, since these results are extracted by retrospective series and do not include external validations, currently it is hard to predict the chances of their application in different study groups.\nTo date, insufficient evidence supports the benefit of radiomics in USs. Nevertheless, this field is promising but the quality of studies should be a priority in these new technologies.", "Pain description is fundamental to health care. The McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ) has been validated as a tool for the multidimensional measurement of pain; however, its use relies heavily on language proficiency. Although the MPQ has remained unchanged since its inception, the English language has evolved significantly since then. The advent of the internet and social media has allowed for the generation of a staggering amount of publicly available data, allowing linguistic analysis at a scale never seen before.\nThe aim of this study is to use social media data to examine the relevance of pain descriptors from the existing MPQ, identify novel contemporary English descriptors for pain among users of social media, and suggest a modification for a new MPQ for future validation and testing.\nAll posts from social media platforms from January 1, 2019, to December 31, 2019, were extracted. Artificial intelligence and emotion analytics algorithms (Crystalace and CrystalFeel) were used to measure the emotional properties of the text, including sarcasm, anger, fear, sadness, joy, and valence. Word2Vec was used to identify new pain descriptors associated with the original descriptors from the MPQ. Analysis of count and pain intensity formed the basis for proposing new pain descriptors and determining the order of pain descriptors within each subclass.\nA total of 118 new associated words were found via Word2Vec. Of these 118 words, 49 (41.5%) words had a count of at least 110, which corresponded to the count of the bottom 10% (8/78) of the original MPQ pain descriptors. The count and intensity of pain descriptors were used to formulate the inclusion criteria for a new pain questionnaire. For the suggested new pain questionnaire, 11 existing pain descriptors were removed, 13 new descriptors were added to existing subclasses, and a new Psychological subclass comprising 9 descriptors was added.\nThis study presents a novel methodology using social media data to identify new pain descriptors and can be repeated at regular intervals to ensure the relevance of pain questionnaires. The original MPQ contains several potentially outdated pain descriptors and is inadequate for reporting the psychological aspects of pain. Further research is needed to examine the reliability and validity of the revised MPQ.", "Pediatric oncology survivors are at risk for executive function (EF) and working memory (WM) deficits, which can be measured via performance-based measures or rating scales. Previous studies have shown these measurement methods to be weakly correlated. This study aimed to describe parent-rated EF and performance-based WM (PBWM) in pediatric brain tumor (BT) survivors, examine change in EF and PBWM across time, and investigate the relationship between parent-rated WM and PBWM.\nThe sample included 56 patients diagnosed with a BT in childhood (Mage\u00a0 =\u00a06.94\u00a0years; SD\u00a0=\u00a04.05) seen twice for clinical neuropsychological evaluation. PBWM was examined via the auditory WM scale from a Wechsler intelligence measure or Differential Ability Scales-II. Parents completed the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF)/BRIEF-P/BRIEF-2 as a measure of global EF (Global Executive Composite [GEC]), metacognitive skills (Metacognitive Index/Cognitive Regulation Index [MI/CRI]), behavioral regulation (Behavior Regulation Index [BRI]), and emotional regulation (Emotion Regulation Index [ERI]).\nGEC, MI/CRI, and ERI at Time 1 were significantly above the mean (p\u00a0<\u00a0.01); BRI and PBWM did not differ from the normative mean. All measures were significantly higher than the normative mean at Time 2 (p\u00a0<\u00a0.05). PBWM was both clinically and statistically elevated (p\u00a0<\u00a0.001). There was a significant change across time in PBWM (p\u00a0<\u00a0.05), but not GEC, MI/CRI, ERI, or BRI. PBWM was weakly correlated with the BRIEF WM subscale at Time 1 and Time 2 (all p\u00a0>\u00a0.05).\nMultiple measures of EF should be considered when providing diagnoses and recommendations for pediatric BT survivors. Furthermore, given declines across time, findings document need for continued monitoring and reassessment of survivors as they get further out from treatment.", "Deep learning is an active bioinformatics artificial intelligence field that is useful in solving many biological problems, including predicting altered epigenetics such as DNA methylation regions. Deep learning (DL) can learn an informative representation that addresses the need for defining relevant features. However, deep learning models are computationally expensive, and they require large training datasets to achieve good classification performance.\nOne approach to addressing these challenges is to use a less complex deep learning network for feature selection and Machine Learning (ML) for classification. In the current study, we introduce a hybrid DL-ML approach that uses a deep neural network for extracting molecular features and a non-DL classifier to predict environmentally responsive transgenerational differential DNA methylated regions (DMRs), termed epimutations, based on the extracted DL-based features. Various environmental toxicant induced epigenetic transgenerational inheritance sperm epimutations were used to train the model on the rat genome DNA sequence and use the model to predict transgenerational DMRs (epimutations) across the entire genome.\nThe approach was also used to predict potential DMRs in the human genome. Experimental results show that the hybrid DL-ML approach outperforms deep learning and traditional machine learning methods.", "Wearable technologies have added completely new and fast emerging tools to the popular field of personal gadgets. Aside from being fashionable and equipped with advanced hardware technologies such as communication modules and networking, wearable devices have the potential to fuel artificial intelligence (AI) methods with a wide range of valuable data.\nVarious AI techniques such as supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised and reinforcement learning (RL) have already been used to carry out various tasks. This paper reviews the recent applications of wearables that have leveraged AI to achieve their objectives.\nParticular example applications of supervised and unsupervised learning for medical diagnosis are reviewed. Moreover, examples combining the internet of things, wearables, and RL are reviewed. Application examples of wearables will be also presented for specific domains such as medical, industrial, and sport. Medical applications include fitness, movement disorder, mental health, etc. Industrial applications include employee performance improvement with the aid of wearables. Sport applications are all about providing better user experience during workout sessions or professional gameplays.\nThe most important challenges regarding design and development of wearable devices and the computation burden of using AI methods are presented. Finally, future challenges and opportunities for wearable devices are presented.", "This paper aims to overview multidimensional mining algorithms in relation to Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) radiogenomics for computer aided detection and diagnosis of breast tumours. The work also aims to address a new problem in radiogenomics mining: how to combine structural radiomics information with non-structural genomics information for improving the accuracy and efficacy of Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy (NAC).\nThis requires the automated extraction of parameters from non-structural breast radiomics data, and finding feature vectors with diagnostic value, which then are combined with genomics data. In order to address the problem of weakly labelled tumour images, a Generative Adiversarial Networks (GAN) based deep learning strategy is proposed for the classification of tumour types; this has significant potential for providing accurate real-time identification of tumorous regions from MRI scans. In order to efficiently integrate in a deep learning framework different features from radiogenomics datasets at multiple spatio-temporal resolutions, pyramid structured and multi-scale densely connected U-Nets are proposed. A bidirectional gated recurrent unit (BiGRU) combined with an attention based deep learning approach is also proposed.\nThe aim is to accurately predict NAC responses by combining imaging and genomic datasets. The approaches discussed incorporate some of the latest developments in of current signal processing and artificial intelligence and have significant potential in advancing and provide a development platform for future cutting-edge biomedical radiogenomics analysis.\nThe association of genotypic and phenotypic features is at the core of the emergent field of Precision Medicine. It makes use of advances in biomedical big data analysis, which enables the correlation between disease-associated phenotypic characteristics, genetics polymorphism and gene activation to be revealed.", "Artificial intelligence provides a promising solution for streamlining COVID-19 diagnoses; however, concerns surrounding security and trustworthiness impede the collection of large-scale representative medical data, posing a considerable challenge for training a well-generalized model in clinical practices. To address this, we launch the Unified CT-COVID AI Diagnostic Initiative (UCADI), where the artificial intelligence (AI) model can be distributedly trained and independently executed at each host institution under a federated learning framework without data sharing. Here we show that our federated learning framework model considerably outperformed all of the local models (with a test sensitivity/specificity of 0.973/0.951 in China and 0.730/0.942 in the United Kingdom), achieving comparable performance with a panel of professional radiologists. We further evaluated the model on the hold-out (collected from another two hospitals without the federated learning framework) and heterogeneous (acquired with contrast materials) data, provided visual explanations for decisions made by the model, and analysed the trade-offs between the model performance and the communication costs in the federated training process. Our study is based on 9,573 chest computed tomography scans from 3,336 patients collected from 23 hospitals located in China and the United Kingdom. Collectively, our work advanced the prospects of utilizing federated learning for privacy-preserving AI in digital health.", "COVID-19 crisis has placed medical systems over the world under unprecedented and growing pressure. Medical imaging processing can help in the diagnosis, treatment, and early detection of diseases. It has been considered as one of the modern technologies applied to fight against the COVID-19 crisis. Although several artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning techniques have been deployed in medical image processing in the context of COVID-19 disease, there is a lack of research considering systematic literature review and categorization of published studies in this field. A systematic review locates, assesses, and interprets research outcomes to address a predetermined research goal to present evidence-based practical and theoretical insights. The main goal of this study is to present a literature review of the deployed methods of medical image processing in the context of the COVID-19 crisis. With this in mind, the studies available in reliable databases were retrieved, studied, evaluated, and synthesized. Based on the in-depth review of literature, this study structured a conceptual map that outlined three multi-layered folds: data gathering and description, main steps of image processing, and evaluation metrics. The main research themes were elaborated in each fold, allowing the authors to recommend upcoming research paths for scholars. The outcomes of this review highlighted that several methods have been adopted to classify the images related to the diagnosis and detection of COVID-19. The adopted methods have presented promising outcomes in terms of accuracy, cost, and detection speed.", "Ultra-processed foods (UPFs) are negatively perceived by part of the scientific community, the public, and policymakers alike, to the extent they are sometimes referred to as not \"real food\". Many observational surveys have linked consumption of UPFs to adverse health outcomes. This narrative synthesis and scientific reappraisal of available evidence aims to: (i) critically evaluate UPF-related scientific literature on diet and disease and identify possible research gaps or biases in the interpretation of data; (ii) emphasize the innovative potential of various processing technologies that can lead to modifications of the food matrix with beneficial health effects; (iii) highlight the possible links between processing, sustainability and circular economy through the valorisation of by-products; and (iv) delineate the conceptual parameters of new paradigms in food evaluation and classification systems. Although greater consumption of UPFs has been associated with obesity, unfavorable cardiometabolic risk factor profiles, and increased risk for non-communicable diseases, whether specific food processing techniques leading to ultra-processed formulations are responsible for the observed links between UPFs and various health outcomes remains elusive and far from being understood. Evolving technologies can be used in the context of sustainable valorisation of food processing by-products to create novel, low-cost UPFs with improved nutritional value and health potential. New paradigms of food evaluation and assessment should be funded and developed on several novel pillars-enginomics, signalling, and precision nutrition-taking advantage of available digital technologies and artificial intelligence. Research is needed to generate required scientific knowledge to either expand the current or create new food evaluation and classification systems, incorporating processing aspects that may have a significant impact on health and wellness, together with factors related to the personalization of foods and diets, while not neglecting recycling and sustainability aspects. The complexity and the predicted immense size of these tasks calls for open innovation mentality and a new mindset promoting multidisciplinary collaborations and partnerships between academia and industry.", "Interest in real-world data (RWD) and real-world evidence (RWE) to expedite and enrich the development of new biopharmaceutical products has proliferated in recent years, spurred by the 21st Century Cures Act in the United States and similar policy efforts in other countries, willingness by regulators to consider RWE in their decisions, demands from third-party payers, and growing concerns about the limitations of traditional clinical trials. Although much of the recent literature on RWE has focused on potential regulatory uses (e.g., product approvals in oncology or rare diseases based on single-arm trials with external control arms), this article reviews how biopharmaceutical companies can leverage RWE to inform internal decisions made throughout the product development process. Specifically, this article will review use of RWD to guide pipeline and portfolio strategy; use of novel sources of RWD to inform product development, use of RWD to inform clinical development, use of advanced analytics to harness \"big\" RWD, and considerations when using RWD to inform internal decisions. Topics discussed will include the use of molecular, clinicogenomic, medical imaging, radiomic, and patient-derived xenograft data to augment traditional sources of RWE, the use of RWD to inform clinical trial eligibility criteria, enrich trial population based on predicted response, select endpoints, estimate sample size, understand disease progression, and enhance diversity of participants, the growing use of data tokenization and advanced analytical techniques based on artificial intelligence in RWE, as well as the importance of data quality and methodological transparency in RWE.", "Heart failure (HF) is associated with considerable morbidity and mortality. The increasing prevalence of HF and inpatient HF hospitalization has a considerable burden on healthcare cost and utilization. The recognition that hemodynamic changes in pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) and left atrial pressure precede the signs and symptoms of HF has led to interest in hemodynamic guided HF therapy as an approach to allow earlier intervention during a heart failure decompensation. Remote patient monitoring (RPM) utilizing telecommunication, cardiac implantable electronic device parameters and implantable hemodynamic monitors (IHM) have largely failed to demonstrate favorable outcomes in multicenter trials. However, one positive randomized clinical trial testing the CardioMEMS device (followed by Food and Drug Administration approval) has generated renewed interest in PAP monitoring in the HF population to decrease hospitalization and improve quality of life. The COVID-19 pandemic has also stirred a resurgence in the utilization of telehealth to which RPM using IHM may be complementary. The cost effectiveness of these monitors continues to be a matter of debate. Future iterations of devices aim to be smaller, less burdensome for the patient, less dependent on patient compliance, and less cumbersome for health care providers with the integration of artificial intelligence coupled with sophisticated data management and interpretation tools. Currently, use of IHM may be considered in advanced heart failure patients with the support of structured programs.", "A growing number of studies have examined whether Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems can support imaging-based diagnosis of COVID-19-caused pneumonia, including both gains in diagnostic performance and speed. However, what is currently missing is a combined appreciation of studies comparing human readers and AI.\nWe followed PRISMA-DTA guidelines for our systematic review, searching EMBASE, PUBMED and Scopus databases. To gain insights into the potential value of AI methods, we focused on studies comparing the performance of human readers versus AI models or versus AI-supported human readings.\nOur search identified 1270 studies, of which 12 fulfilled specific selection criteria. Concerning diagnostic performance, in testing datasets reported sensitivity was 42-100% (human readers, n\u202f=\u202f9 studies), 60-95% (AI systems, n\u202f=\u202f10) and 81-98% (AI-supported readers, n\u202f=\u202f3), whilst reported specificity was 26-100% (human readers, n\u202f=\u202f8), 61-96% (AI systems, n\u202f=\u202f10) and 78-99% (AI-supported readings, n\u202f=\u202f2). One study highlighted the potential of AI-supported readings for the assessment of lung lesion burden changes, whilst two studies indicated potential time savings for detection with AI.\nOur review indicates that AI systems or AI-supported human readings show less performance variability (interquartile range) in general, and may support the differentiation of COVID-19 pneumonia from other forms of pneumonia when used in high-prevalence and symptomatic populations. However, inconsistencies related to study design, reporting of data, areas of risk of bias, as well as limitations of statistical analyses complicate clear conclusions. We therefore support efforts for developing critical elements of study design when assessing the value of AI for diagnostic imaging.", "The study of human cognition and the study of artificial intelligence (AI) have a symbiotic relationship, with advancements in one field often informing or creating new work in the other. Human cognition has many capabilities modern AI systems cannot compete with. One such capability is the detection, identification, and resolution of knowledge gaps (KGs). Using these capabilities as inspiration, we examine how to incorporate detection, identification, and resolution of KGs in artificial agents. We present a paradigm that enables research on the understanding of KGs for visual-linguistic communication. We leverage and enhance and existing KG taxonomy to identify possible KGs that can occur for visual question answer (VQA) tasks and use these findings to develop a classifier to identify questions that could be engineered to contain specific KG types for other VQA datasets. Additionally, we examine the performance of different VQA models through the lens of\u00a0KGs.", "With the global burden of cancer on the rise, it is critical to developing new modalities that could detect cancer and guide targeted treatments in fast and inexpensive ways. The need for such technologies is vital, especially in underserved regions where severe diagnostic bottlenecks exist. Recently, we developed a low-cost digital diagnostic system for breast cancer using fine-needle aspirates (FNAs). Named, AIDA (artificial intelligence diffraction analysis), the system combines lens-free digital diffraction imaging with deep-learning algorithms to achieve automated, rapid, and high-throughput cellular analyses for breast cancer diagnosis of FNA and subtype classification for better-guided treatments (Min et al. ACS Nano 12:9081-9090, 2018). Although primarily validated for breast cancer and lymphoma (Min et al. ACS Nano 12:9081-9090, 2018; Im et al. Nat Biomed Eng 2:666-674, 2018), the system could be easily adapted to diagnosing other prevalent cancers and thus find widespread use for global health.", "Fake news and misinformation have adopted various propagation media over time, nowadays spreading predominantly through online social networks. During the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, false information is affecting human life in many spheres The world needs automated detection technology and efforts are being made to meet this requirement with the use of artificial intelligence. Neural network detection mechanisms are robust and durable and hence are used extensively in fake news detection. Deep learning algorithms demonstrate efficiency when they are provided with a large amount of training data. Given the scarcity of relevant fake news datasets, we built the Coronavirus Infodemic Dataset (CovID), which contains fake news posts and articles related to coronavirus. This paper presents a novel framework, the Allied Recurrent and Convolutional Neural Network (ARCNN), to detect fake news based on two different modalities: text and image. Our approach uses recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and combines both streams to generate a final prediction. We present extensive research on various popular RNN and CNN models and their performance on six coronavirus-specific fake news datasets. To exhaustively analyze performance, we present experimentation performed and results obtained by combining both modalities using early fusion and four types of late fusion techniques. The proposed framework is validated by comparisons with state-of-the-art fake news detection mechanisms, and our models outperform each of them.", "The artificial intelligence (AI) revolution is well underway, including in the medical field, and has dramatically transformed our lives. An understanding of the basics of AI applications, their development, and challenges to their clinical implementation is important for clinicians to fully appreciate the possibilities of AI. Such a foundation would ensure that clinicians have a good grasp and realistic expectations for AI in medicine and prevent discrepancies between the promised and real-world impact. When quantifying the track record for AI applications in cardiology, we found that a substantial number of AI systems are never deployed in clinical practice, although there certainly are many success stories. Successful implementations shared the following: they came from clinical areas where large amount of training data was available; were deployable into a single diagnostic modality; prediction models generally had high performance in external validation; and most were developed as part of collaborations with medical device manufacturers who had substantial experience with implementation of new clinical technology. When looking into the current processes used for developing AI-based systems, we suggest that expanding the analytic framework to address potential deployment and implementation issues at project outset will improve the rate of successful implementation, and will be a necessary next step for AI to achieve its full potential in cardiovascular medicine.", "In many sea areas, toxic and harmful chemicals vastly exceed the standard, which not only has had a very bad impact on the survival of marine organisms, but also damages the safety of edible groundwater. With the continuous development of artificial intelligence and deep learning, the most efficient and safe method to detect seawater is with unmanned ship. By processing and fusing the images transmitted by the two radars, the common advantages of the two sensors are integrated, and the comprehensiveness of the unmanned aerial vehicle's (UAV;s) perception of the surrounding environment is improved. In order to improve the accuracy and safety of UAV offshore operations, this study designed an electric propulsion unmanned ship and its automatic control system according to the requirements of water quality sampling. Based on the small body theory, the model of an unmanned ship with the least resistance and the best safety is designed. According to the requirements of water quality sampling in sea areas, the vessel was equipped with collection and analysis systems to measure six elements of water quality. The Realizable k-e turbulence model was used to simulate the self-recovery ability of an unmanned ship under wave disturbance. Theoretically, the unmanned ship can achieve self-righting in 4.25 s. For actual navigation, the unmanned ship can effectively avoid obstacles, and the basic information on seawater quality was within the specified range. The unmanned ship constructed in this study can be used as an auxiliary tool for water quality detection. Compared with various study methods, the proposed method obtained a better performance.", "(1) Background: The new SARS-COV-2 pandemic overwhelmed intensive care units, clinicians, and radiologists, so the development of methods to forecast the diagnosis' severity became a necessity and a helpful tool. (2) Methods: In this paper, we proposed an artificial intelligence-based multimodal approach to forecast the future diagnosis' severity of patients with laboratory-confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection. At hospital admission, we collected 46 clinical and biological variables with chest X-ray scans from 475 COVID-19 positively tested patients. An ensemble of machine learning algorithms (AI-Score) was developed to predict the future severity score as mild, moderate, and severe for COVID-19-infected patients. Additionally, a deep learning module (CXR-Score) was developed to automatically classify the chest X-ray images and integrate them into AI-Score. (3) Results: The AI-Score predicted the COVID-19 diagnosis' severity on the testing/control dataset (95 patients) with an average accuracy of 98.59%, average specificity of 98.97%, and average sensitivity of 97.93%. The CXR-Score module graded the severity of chest X-ray images with an average accuracy of 99.08% on the testing/control dataset (95 chest X-ray images). (4) Conclusions: Our study demonstrated that the deep learning methods based on the integration of clinical and biological data with chest X-ray images accurately predicted the COVID-19 severity score of positive-tested patients.", "Early and accurate radiographic diagnosis is required for the management of children with radio-opaque esophageal foreign bodies. Button batteries are some of the most dangerous esophageal foreign bodies and coins are among the most common. We hypothesized that artificial intelligence could be used to triage radiographs with esophageal button batteries and coins.\nOur primary objective was to train an object detector to detect esophageal foreign bodies, whether button battery or coin. Our secondary objective was to train an image classifier to classify the detected foreign body as either a button battery or a coin.\nWe trained an object detector to detect button batteries and coins. The training data set for the object detector was 57 radiographs, consisting of 3 groups of 19 images each with either an esophageal button battery, esophageal coin or no foreign body. The foreign bodies were endoscopically confirmed, and the groups were age and gender matched. We then trained an image classifier to classify the detected foreign body as either a button battery or a coin. The training data set for the image classifier consisted of 19 radiographs of button batteries and 19 of coins, cropped from the object detector training data set. The object detector and image classifier were then tested on 103 radiographs with an esophageal foreign body, and 103 radiographs without a foreign body.\nThe object detector was 100% sensitive and specific for detecting an esophageal foreign body. The image classifier accurately classified all 6/6 (100%) button batteries in the testing data set and 93/95 (97.9%) of the coins. The remaining two coins were incorrectly classified as button batteries. In addition to these images with a single button battery or coin, there were two unique cases in the testing data set: a stacked button battery and coin, and two stacked coins, both of which were classified as coins.\nArtificial intelligence models show promise in detecting and classifying esophageal discoid foreign bodies and could potentially be used to triage radiographs for radiologist interpretation.", "All living systems perpetuate themselves via growth in or on the body, followed by splitting, budding, or birth. We find that synthetic multicellular assemblies can also replicate kinematically by moving and compressing dissociated cells in their environment into functional self-copies. This form of perpetuation, previously unseen in any organism, arises spontaneously over days rather than evolving over millennia. We also show how artificial intelligence methods can design assemblies that postpone loss of replicative ability and perform useful work as a side effect of replication. This suggests other unique and useful phenotypes can be rapidly reached from wild-type organisms without selection or genetic engineering, thereby broadening our understanding of the conditions under which replication arises, phenotypic plasticity, and how useful replicative machines may be realized.", "Three-dimensional convolutional neural networks (3D CNN) of artificial intelligence (AI) are potent in image processing and recognition using deep learning to perform generative and descriptive tasks. Compared to its predecessor, the advantage of CNN is that it automatically detects the important features without any human supervision. 3D CNN is used to extract features in three dimensions where input is a 3D volume or a sequence of 2D pictures, e.g., slices in a cone-beam computer tomography scan (CBCT). The main aim was to bridge interdisciplinary cooperation between forensic medical experts and deep learning engineers, emphasizing activating clinical forensic experts in the field with possibly basic knowledge of advanced artificial intelligence techniques with interest in its implementation in their efforts to advance forensic research further. This paper introduces a novel workflow of 3D CNN analysis of full-head CBCT scans. Authors explore the current and design customized 3D CNN application methods for particular forensic research in five perspectives: (1) sex determination, (2) biological age estimation, (3) 3D cephalometric landmark annotation, (4) growth vectors prediction, (5) facial soft-tissue estimation from the skull and vice versa. In conclusion, 3D CNN application can be a watershed moment in forensic medicine, leading to unprecedented improvement of forensic analysis workflows based on 3D neural networks.", "Artificial intelligence provides modelling on machines by simulating the human brain using learning and decision-making abilities. Early diagnosis is highly effective in reducing mortality in cancer. This study aimed to combine cancer-associated risk factors including genetic variations and design an artificial intelligence system for risk assessment. Data from a total of 268 breast cancer patients have been analysed for 16 different risk factors including genetic variant classifications. In total, 61 BRCA1, 128 BRCA2 and 11 both BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes associated breast cancer patients' data were used to train the system using Mamdani's Fuzzy Inference Method and Feed-Forward Neural Network Method as the model softwares on MATLAB. Sixteen different tests were performed on twelve different subjects who had not been introduced to the system before. The rates for neural network were 99.9% for training success, 99.6% for validation success and 99.7% for test success. Despite neural network's overall success was slightly higher than fuzzy logic accuracy, the results from developed systems were similar (99.9% and 95.5%, respectively). The developed models make predictions from a wider perspective using more risk factors including genetic variation data compared with similar studies in the literature. Overall, this artificial intelligence models present promising results for BRCA variations' risk assessment in breast cancers as well as a unique tool for personalized medicine software.", "The present research poses a novel multilevel model to describe how transformational leadership can significantly affect task performance and counterproductive work behavior through intermediary effects of emotional intelligence, work engagement, and work burnout. The empirical data is from 240 livestock feeders from 80 Taiwanese livestock production agribusinesses. The empirical results demonstrate that leadership could indeed transform the emotional intelligence of livestock feeders into positive task performance and negative counterproductive work behavior. The research results can provide an implementation method for livestock production agribusinesses to achieve the sustainable work of feeders in agribusinesses through handling task performance and counterproductive work behavior of feeders.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) is concretely reshaping the landscape and horizons of oncology, opening new important opportunities for improving the management of cancer patients. Analysing the AI-based devices that have already obtained the official approval by the Federal Drug Administration (FDA), here we show that cancer diagnostics is the oncology-related area in which AI is already entered with the largest impact into clinical practice. Furthermore, breast, lung and prostate cancers represent the specific cancer types that now are experiencing more advantages from AI-based devices. The future perspectives of AI in oncology are discussed: the creation of multidisciplinary platforms, the comprehension of the importance of all neoplasms, including rare tumours and the continuous support for guaranteeing its growth represent in this time the most important challenges for finalising the 'AI-revolution' in oncology.", "To curb the diffusion of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), governments worldwide have introduced different policies, including lockdowns, social distancing, and mandatory mask wearing. Face mask wearing, especially, has an impact on the formation of first impressions, given that when meeting someone for the first time, individuals rely on the only available piece of information, the newly met person's aesthetic appearance, in order to make initial estimations of other traits, such as competence, intelligence, or trustworthiness. However, face mask wearing affects the aesthetic appearance of an individual, creating uncertainty which, in turn, has been reported to reduce others' perceived trustworthiness. In this paper, the influence of face mask wearing on strangers' perceived trustworthiness and aesthetic appearance is assessed to verify the impact of this policy on impression formation. Participants (N = 71) have been instructed to assess the trustworthiness and the aesthetic appearance of a selection of 96 images depicting individuals of different ages (children, adults, and older adults), gender (men and women), and ethnicity (Asians or Caucasians). Participants were randomly divided into two groups: an experimental group and a control group. Participants in the experimental group (N = 38) rated faces of individuals wearing a face mask, while participants in the control group rated the same faces but in the absence of a face mask. Images were presented in random order. For each face, participants were asked to rate the aesthetic appearance and perceived trustworthiness of the stranger on two different 100-point Likert scales. Results demonstrate that (i) the correlation between perceived trustworthiness and aesthetic appearance is not affected by the presence of a face mask, and (ii) age, but not ethnicity and gender, influences the magnitude of differences in perceived trustworthiness levels during mask wearing.", "Green and blue spaces have numerous health benefits. It has been hypothesized that contact with these spaces can have an important role in cognitive development, because it provides children with unique stimuli that can help develop curiosity, creativity, awareness, and control. This study aimed to estimate the association between exposure to green and blue spaces and the various measures of intelligence quotient (IQ) among children from Porto Metropolitan Area (Portugal). This investigation used data from the Generation XXI birth cohort. Exposure was assessed by Geographic Information Systems using vegetation indexes and measures of accessibility to urban green spaces and blue spaces in the surroundings of the residence and school, measured at 0, 4, 7 and 10\u00a0years. The outcome was the verbal, performance, and global IQ, measured using the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC-III), administered at age 10. Associations were estimated using crude and adjusted multilevel models. The mediation role of air pollution and physical activity was quantified. This study included 3827 children. The adjusted models showed that having green spaces up to 800\u00a0m of the residence was positively associated with performance IQ (1.30 95%CI [0.26; 2.35]) and global IQ (1.27 [0.18; 2.36]). No clear associations were observed regarding accessibility to blue spaces. Physical activity appeared to have a minor mediation role. Children with urban green spaces around their residences had higher performance and global IQ. Local actors in the sectors of public health and urban planning should promote the creation of green spaces close to residential areas.", "Domain-aware artificial intelligence has been increasingly adopted in recent years to expedite molecular design in various applications, including drug design and discovery. Recent advances in areas such as physics-informed machine learning and reasoning, software engineering, high-end hardware development, and computing infrastructures are providing opportunities to build scalable and explainable AI molecular discovery systems. This could improve a design hypothesis through feedback analysis, data integration that can provide a basis for the introduction of end-to-end automation for compound discovery and optimization, and enable more intelligent searches of chemical space. Several state-of-the-art ML architectures are predominantly and independently used for predicting the properties of small molecules, their high throughput synthesis, and screening, iteratively identifying and optimizing lead therapeutic candidates. However, such deep learning and ML approaches also raise considerable conceptual, technical, scalability, and end-to-end error quantification challenges, as well as skepticism about the current AI hype to build automated tools. To this end, synergistically and intelligently using these individual components along with robust quantum physics-based molecular representation and data generation tools in a closed-loop holds enormous promise for accelerated therapeutic design to critically analyze the opportunities and challenges for their more widespread application. This article aims to identify the most recent technology and breakthrough achieved by each of the components and discusses how such autonomous AI and ML workflows can be integrated to radically accelerate the protein target or disease model-based probe design that can be iteratively validated experimentally. Taken together, this could significantly reduce the timeline for end-to-end therapeutic discovery and optimization upon the arrival of any novel zoonotic transmission event. Our article serves as a guide for medicinal, computational chemistry and biology, analytical chemistry, and the ML community to practice autonomous molecular design in precision medicine and drug discovery.", "The rapid development of intelligent manufacturing provides strong support for the intelligent medical service ecosystem. Researchers are committed to building Wise Information Technology of 120 (WIT 120) for residents and medical personnel with the concept of simple smart medical care and through core technologies such as Internet of Things, Big Data Analytics, Artificial Intelligence, and microservice framework, to improve patient safety, medical quality, clinical efficiency, and operational benefits. Among them, how to use computers and deep learning technology to assist in the diagnosis of tongue images and realize intelligent tongue diagnosis has become a major trend. Tongue crack is an important feature of tongue states. Not only does change of tongue crack states reflect objectively and accurately changed circumstances of some typical diseases and TCM syndrome but also semantic segmentation of fissured tongue can combine the other features of tongue states to further improve tongue diagnosis systems' identification accuracy. Although computer tongue diagnosis technology has made great progress, there are few studies on the fissured tongue, and most of them focus on the analysis of tongue coating and body. In this paper, we do systematic and in-depth researches and propose an improved U-Net network for image semantic segmentation of fissured tongue. By introducing the Global Convolution Network module into the encoder part of U-Net, it solves the problem that the encoder part is relatively simple and cannot extract relatively abstract high-level semantic features. Finally, the method is verified by experiments. The improved U-Net network has a better segmentation effect and higher segmentation accuracy for fissured tongue image dataset. It can be used to design a computer-aided tongue diagnosis system.", "Cockayne syndrome (CS) is a rare form of dwarfism that is characterized by progressive premature aging. CS is typically caused by mutations in the excision repair cross-complementing protein group 6 (ERCC6) gene that encodes the CS group B (CSB) protein. Using whole exome sequencing, we recently identified a novel homozygous missense mutation (Leu536Trp) in CSB in a Taiwanese boy with CS. Since the current database (Varsome) interprets this variant as likely pathogenic, we utilized a bioinformatic tool to investigate the impact of Leu536Trp as well as two other variants (Arg453Ter, Asp532Gly) in similar articles on the CSB protein structure stability.\nWe used iterative threading assembly refinement (I-TASSER) to generate a predictive 3D structure of CSB. We calculated the change of mutation energy after residues substitution on the protein stability using I-TASSER as well as the artificial intelligence program Alphafold.\nThe Asp532Gly variant destabilized both modeled structures, while the Leu536Trp variant showed no effect on I-TASSER's model but destabilized the Alphafold's modeled structure.\nWe propose here the first case of CS associated with a novel homozygous missense mutation (Leu536Trp) in CSB. Furthermore, we suggest that the Asp532Gly and Leu536Trp variants are both pathogenic after bioinformatic analysis of protein stability.", "Aging is a universal feature of life and a complex process at all levels from the biological to the societal. What constitutes older age is subjective and flexible, and how one defines older age is influenced by everchanging individual, generational, and cultural expectations. As the global population ages at an unprecedented rate, we are increasingly confronted with a myriad of challenges associated with aging, including increased healthcare needs and the far-reaching negative consequences of individual and structural agism. However, the shift in world demographics toward an older population is not a growing burden, but an opportunity to reshape our view of older life and proactively embrace healthy aging. Indeed, a healthy person is not defined by the absence of illness, but by the potential for meaningful work, positive relationships, and longevity. Simple preventive measures, such as improved diet and increased exercise, can enhance overall health and quality of life, and growing evidence highlights the potential of positive psychology for improving psychological well-being and overall quality of life. Now more than ever, technological innovation including artificial intelligence can be leveraged to improve our understanding of the causes and consequences of aging, as well as the most effective interventions to enhance resilience and extend healthy longevity. Good health is our greatest asset. It is the responsibility of all-individuals, society, business, science, healthcare systems, and government-to ensure that everyone is well equipped to maintain good health. Together, we can all live better, longer.", "With the rapid advancement of information technology, artificial intelligence (AI) is being progressively utilized in various fields.

However, due to the high dynamics of the vehicular network and frequent interruptions and handovers, it is still challenging to provide stable communication connections between vehicles, which is likely to cause disasters. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose an intelligent clustering mechanism based on driving patterns in heterogeneous Cognitive Internet of Vehicles (CIoVs). In the proposed approach, we analyze the driving mode containing multiple feature parameters to accurately capture the driving characteristics. To ensure the accuracy of pattern recognition, a genetic algorithm-based neural network pattern recognition algorithm is proposed to support the reliable clustering of connected autonomous vehicles. The cognitive engines recognize the driving modes to group vehicles with a similar driving mode into a relatively stable cluster. In addition, we formulate the stability and survival time of clusters and analyze the communication performance of the clustering mechanism. Simulation results show that the proposed mechanism improves the reliable communication throughput and average cluster lifetime by approximately 14.4% and 11.5% respectively compared to the state-of-the-art approaches.", "Although the automatic diagnosis of fractures using artificial intelligence (AI) has recently been reported to be more accurate than those by orthopedics specialists, big data with at least 1000 images or more are required for deep learning of the convolutional neural network (CNN) to improve diagnostic accuracy. The aim of this study was to develop an AI system capable of diagnosing distal radius fractures with high accuracy even when learning with relatively small data by learning to use bi-planar X-rays images.\nVGG16, a learned image recognition model, was used as the CNN. It was modified into a network with two output layers to identify the fractures in plain X-ray images. We augmented 369 plain X-ray anteroposterior images and 360 lateral images of distal radius fractures, as well as 129 anteroposterior images and 125 lateral images of normal wrists to conduct training and diagnostic tests. Similarly, diagnostic tests for fractures of the styloid process of the ulna were conducted using 189 plain X-ray anteroposterior images of fractures and 302 images of the normal styloid process. The distal radius fracture is determined by entering an anteroposterior image of the wrist for testing into the trained AI. If it identifies a fracture, it is diagnosed as the same. However, if the anteroposterior image is determined as normal, the lateral image of the same patient is entered. If a fracture is identified, the final diagnosis is fracture; if the lateral image is identified as normal, the final diagnosis is normal.\nThe diagnostic accuracy of distal radius fractures and fractures of the styloid process of the ulna were 98.0\u2009\u00b1\u20091.6% and 91.1\u2009\u00b1\u20092.5%, respectively. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve were 0.991 {n\u2009=\u2009540; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.984-0.999} and 0.956 (n\u2009=\u2009450; 95% CI 0.938-0.973).\nOur method resulted in a good diagnostic rate, even when using a relatively small amount of data.", "To evaluate the risk category performance of artificial intelligence-based coronary artery calcium score (AI-CACS) software used in non-gated chest computed tomography (CT) on three types of CT machines, considering the manual method as the standard.\nA total of 901 patients who underwent both chest CT and electrocardiogram (ECG)-gated non-contrast-enhanced cardiac CT with the same equipment within a 3-month period were enrolled in the study. AI-CACS software was based on a deep learning algorithm and was trained on multi-vendor, multi-scanner, and multi-hospital anonymized data from the chest CT database. The AI-CACS was automatically obtained from chest CT data by the AI-CACS software, while the manual CACS was obtained from cardiac CT data by the manual method. The correlation of the AI-CACS and manual CACS, concordance rate and kappa value of the risk categories determined by the two methods were calculated. The chi-square test was used to evaluate the differences in risk categories among the three types of CT machines from different manufacturers. The risk category performance of the AI-CACS for dichotomous risk categories bounded by 0, 100 and 400 was assessed.\nThe correlation of the AI-CACS with the manual CACS was \u03c1\u00a0=\u00a00.893 (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). The Bland-Altman plot (AI-CACS minus manual CACS) showed a mean difference of -27.2 and 95% limits of agreement of -290.0 to 235.6. The agreement of risk categories for the CACS was kappa (\u03ba)\u00a0=\u00a00.679 (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), and the concordance rate was 80.6%. The risk categories determined by the AI-CACS software on three types of CT machines were not significantly different (p\u00a0=\u00a00.7543). As dichotomous risk categories bounded by 0, 100 and 400, the accuracy, kappa value, and area under the curve of the AI-CACS were 88.6% vs. 92.9% vs. 97.9%, 0.77 vs. 0.77 vs. 0.83, and 0.885 vs. 0.964 vs. 0.981, respectively.\nThere was good correlation and agreement between the AI-CACS and manual CACS in terms of the risk category. It is feasible to obtain the CACS using AI software based on non-gated chest CT data in a short time without increasing the radiation dose or economic burden. The AI-CACS software algorithm has good clinical universality and can be applied to CT machines from different manufacturers.", "Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a brain dysfunction caused by liver insufficiency and/or portosystemic shunting. HE manifests as a spectrum of neurological or psychiatric abnormalities. Diagnosis of overt HE (OHE) is based on the typical clinical manifestation, but covert HE (CHE) has only very subtle clinical signs and minimal HE (MHE) is detected only by specialized time-consuming psychometric tests, for which there is still no universally accepted gold standard. Significant progress has been made in artificial intelligence and its application to medicine. In this review, we introduce how artificial intelligence has been used to diagnose minimal hepatic encephalopathy thus far, and we discuss its further potential in analyzing speech and handwriting data, which are probably the most accessible data for evaluating the cognitive state of the patient.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming ever more frequently applied in medicine and, consequently, also in ophthalmology to improve both the quality of work for physicians and the quality of care for patients. The aim of this study is to use AI, in particular classification tree, for the evaluation of both ocular and systemic features involved in the onset of complications due to cataract surgery in a teaching hospital.\nThe charts of 1392 eyes of 1392 patients, with a mean age of 71.3 \u00b1 8.2 years old, were reviewed to collect the ocular and systemic data before, during and after cataract surgery, including post-operative complications. All these data were processed by a classification tree algorithm, producing more than 260 million simulations, aiming to develop a predictive model.\nPostoperative complications were observed in 168 patients. According to the AI analysis, the pre-operative characteristics involved in the insurgence of complications were: ocular comorbidities, lower visual acuity, higher astigmatism and intra-operative complications.\nArtificial intelligence application may be an interesting tool in the physician's hands to develop customized algorithms that can, in advance, define the post-operative complication risk. This may help in improving both the quality and the outcomes of the surgery as well as in preventing patient dissatisfaction.", "Vertigo is a sensation of movement that results from disorders of the inner ear balance organs and their central connections, with aetiologies that are often benign and sometimes serious. An individual who develops vertigo can be effectively treated only after a correct diagnosis of the underlying vestibular disorder is reached. Recent advances in artificial intelligence promise novel strategies for the diagnosis and treatment of patients with this common symptom. Human analysts may experience difficulties manually extracting patterns from large clinical datasets. Machine learning techniques can be used to visualize, understand, and classify clinical data to create a computerized, faster, and more accurate evaluation of vertiginous disorders. Practitioners can also use them as a teaching tool to gain knowledge and valuable insights from medical data. This paper provides a review of the literatures from 1999 to 2021 using various feature extraction and machine learning techniques to diagnose vertigo disorders. This paper aims to provide a better understanding of the work done thus far and to provide future directions for research into the use of machine learning in vertigo diagnosis.", "Background and Purpose: Only 1-2% of the internal carotid artery asymptomatic plaques are unstable as a result of >80% stenosis. Thus, unnecessary efforts can be saved if these plaques can be characterized and classified into symptomatic and asymptomatic using non-invasive B-mode ultrasound. Earlier plaque tissue characterization (PTC) methods were machine learning (ML)-based, which used hand-crafted features that yielded lower accuracy and unreliability. The proposed study shows the role of transfer learning (TL)-based deep learning models for PTC. Methods: As pertained weights were used in the supercomputer framework, we hypothesize that transfer learning (TL) provides improved performance compared with deep learning. We applied 11 kinds of artificial intelligence (AI) models, 10 of them were augmented and optimized using TL approaches-a class of Atheromatic\u2122 2.0 TL (AtheroPoint\u2122, Roseville, CA, USA) that consisted of (i-ii) Visual Geometric Group-16, 19 (VGG16, 19); (iii) Inception V3 (IV3); (iv-v) DenseNet121, 169; (vi) XceptionNet; (vii) ResNet50; (viii) MobileNet; (ix) AlexNet; (x) SqueezeNet; and one DL-based (xi) SuriNet-derived from UNet. We benchmark 11 AI models against our earlier deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) model. Results: The best performing TL was MobileNet, with accuracy and area-under-the-curve (AUC) pairs of 96.10 \u00b1 3% and 0.961 (p < 0.0001), respectively. In DL, DCNN was comparable to SuriNet, with an accuracy of 95.66% and 92.7 \u00b1 5.66%, and an AUC of 0.956 (p < 0.0001) and 0.927 (p < 0.0001), respectively. We validated the performance of the AI architectures with established biomarkers such as greyscale median (GSM), fractal dimension (FD), higher-order spectra (HOS), and visual heatmaps. We benchmarked against previously developed Atheromatic\u2122 1.0 ML and showed an improvement of 12.9%. Conclusions: TL is a powerful AI tool for PTC into symptomatic and asymptomatic plaques.", "To provide latest findings of Urologic Oncology on prostate, kidney, and bladder cancer, and analyze its impact on clinical practice as well as future schemes in the medium- and long-term.\nThis document reviews the abstracts on Uro-Oncology presented at the 2020 Congresses (EUA, AUA, ASCO, ESMO and ASTRO), the publications with the highest impact and especially the new lines of development and progress in Uro-Oncology evaluated by the OncoForum committee.\nThe use of prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) radioligands in the diagnosis of prostate cancer may have great potential and utility in the coming years due to their improved sensitivity and specificity. The genetic characterization of the tumor is important at both, germline and somatic levels, due to the significant role of BRCA2 mutations regarding risk. The cohort multiple randomised controlled trial is the most suitable study design at the genitourinary cancer level. The application of big data will lead to process improvements, savings in healthcare costs, and an empowerment of real-life studies through ease of data comparison, management, and storage.\nThe use of new diagnostic techniques with PSMA ligands will provide a more comprehensive diagnostic modality, increase the number of studies about tumor genetic profiling, and enhance their quality. The practical application of artificial intelligence will improve the treatment genitourinary cancer.", "Monitoring the ecological status of coastal ecosystems is essential to track the consequences of anthropogenic pressures and assess conservation actions. Monitoring requires periodic measurements collected in situ, replicated over large areas and able to capture their spatial distribution over time. This means developing tools and protocols that are cost-effective and provide consistent and high-quality data, which is a major challenge. A new tool and protocol with these capabilities for non-extractively assessing the status of fishes and benthic habitats is presented here: the KOSMOS 3.0 underwater video system.\nThe KOSMOS 3.0 was conceived based on the pre-existing and successful STAVIRO lander, and developed within a digital fabrication laboratory where collective intelligence was contributed mostly voluntarily within a managed project. Our suite of mechanical, electrical, and software engineering skills were combined with ecological knowledge and field work experience.\nPool and aquarium tests of the KOSMOS 3.0 satisfied all the required technical specifications and operational testing. The prototype demonstrated high optical performance and high consistency with image data from the STAVIRO. The project's outcomes are shared under a Creative Commons Attribution CC-BY-SA license. The low cost of a KOSMOS unit (~1400 \u20ac) makes multiple units affordable to modest research or monitoring budgets.", "To compare the choroidal vascularity of large- and middle-sized choroidal vessels and choriocapillaris (CC) perfusion in patients with different degrees of myopia using swept-source optical coherence tomography angiography (SS-OCTA).\nOne hundred and thirteen people with myopia were enrolled. SS-OCTA was performed to analyze the choroidal vascularity and CC perfusion. Three-dimensional (3D) choroidal vascularity index (CVI) and choroidal luminal volumes (LV) were obtained by artificial intelligence segmentation of the choroidal lumen in Volume OCT images. CC perfusion was assessed by flow signal voids (FSVs).\nIn the macular, multiple linear regression model showed that choroidal thickness (CT), total choroidal volume, LV, and choroidal stromal volume were negatively correlated with axis length (AL), respectively (all p < 0.001). Three dimensional CVI was negatively associated with AL (p < 0.05). FSV% was positively correlated with age only (p < 0.001). Additionally, after adjustment for age and AL, FSV% had a significant negative correlation with CT (p < 0.05).\nChoroidal vascularity decreases gradually with increasing severity of myopia. The decrease of CC blood perfusion was related to a higher severity of myopia and the thinning of choroid.", "There has been significant interest in big data analysis and artificial intelligence (AI) in medicine. Ever-increasing medical data and advanced computing power have enabled the number of big data analyses and AI studies to increase rapidly. Here we briefly introduce epilepsy, big data, and AI and review big data analysis using a common data model. Studies in which AI has been actively applied, such as those of electroencephalography epileptiform discharge detection, seizure detection, and forecasting, will be reviewed. We will also provide practical suggestions for pediatricians to understand and interpret big data analysis and AI research and work together with technical expertise.", "The objective of the paper is to evaluate the quality of systemic change management (CHM) and readiness for change in five Central European countries. The secondary goal is to identify trends and upcoming changes in the field of digital innovations in healthcare. The results show that all compared countries (regardless of their historical context) deal with similar CHM challenges with a rather similar degree of success. A questionnaire distributed to hospitals clearly showed that there is still considerable room for improvement in terms of the use of specific CHM tools. A review focused on digital innovations based on the PRISMA statement showed that there are five main directions, namely, data collection and integration, telemedicine, artificial intelligence, electronic medical records, and M-Health. In the hospital environment, there are considerable reservations in applying change management principles, as well as the absence of a systemic approach. The main factors that must be monitored for a successful and sustainable CHM include a clearly defined and widely communicated vision, early engagement of all stakeholders, precisely set rules, adaptation to the local context and culture, provision of a technical base, and a step-by-step implementation with strong feedback.", "With the advent of big data and the popularity of black-box deep learning methods, it is imperative to address the robustness of neural networks to noise and outliers. We propose the use of Winsorization to recover model performances when the data may have outliers and other aberrant observations. We provide a comparative analysis of several probabilistic artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques for supervised learning case studies. Broadly, Winsorization is a versatile technique for accounting for outliers in data. However, different probabilistic machine learning techniques have different levels of efficiency when used on outlier-prone data, with or without Winsorization. We notice that Gaussian processes are extremely vulnerable to outliers, while deep learning techniques in general are more robust.", "COVID-19 has spread rapidly and become a health crisis around the world, and negatively affected the mental state of individuals. Emotional intelligence (EI) can play an important role in coping with the mental problems experienced due to the pandemic. This study examined how individuals' emotional intelligence levels affect depression and satisfaction with life during the COVID-19 period. The study was designed as quantitative and cross-sectional and reached 578 adult participants online. Emotional intelligence trait scale-short form, depression subscale (DASS-21), satisfaction with life scale, and sociodemographic questions as control variables were used as data collection tools in the study. The data obtained were conducted using SPSS 24, PROCESS-Macro, and Amos 25 statistical programs. The hypotheses established were tested by correlation, multiple regression, mediating, and moderating analyzes. Results confirmed that emotional intelligence had a positive association with satisfaction with life and a negative association with depression. In addition, interaction analyses found that age and family type had a moderating effect on satisfaction with life, and depression had a mediating effect. After discussing the importance of emotional intelligence as a coping mechanism in dealing with problems, some suggestions were made to policymakers and practitioners.", "Moral intelligence is an important parameter that forms the basis and cornerstone of ethics in nursing. It is necessary to determine whether moral intelligence is reflected in the care that forms the basis of nursing. This study was carried out with the aim of determining the reflections of nurses' moral intelligence levels on their care behaviors.\nThis study was descriptive and cross-sectional in nature. The study's sample size is 200 nurses. A personal Information Form, Moral Intelligence Scale, and Caring Behaviors Scale were used to collect data. It was determined that nurses' moral intelligence levels and caring behavior average scores were high. There was a highly significant positive connection (p\u2009=\u20090.001) between the mean scores of the moral intelligence total and subdimensions. And the mean scores of the caring behavior total and subdimensions.\nIt is very important to determine the moral intelligence levels, which are acquired and developed ability and directly affect nursing care, and to take initiatives to improve the quality of the care provided.", "We sought to analyze the prognostic value of laboratory and clinical data, and an artificial intelligence (AI)-based algorithm for Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) severity scoring, on CT-scans of patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Moreover, we aimed to determine personalized probabilities of clinical deterioration. Data of symptomatic patients with COVID-19 who underwent chest-CT-examination at the time of hospital admission between April and November 2020 were analyzed. COVID-19 severity score was automatically quantified for each pulmonary lobe as the percentage of affected lung parenchyma with the AI-based algorithm. Clinical deterioration was defined as a composite of admission to the intensive care unit, need for invasive mechanical ventilation, use of vasopressors or in-hospital mortality. In total 326 consecutive patients were included in the analysis (mean age 66.7 \u00b1 15.3 years, 52.1% male) of whom 85 (26.1%) experienced clinical deterioration. In the multivariable regression analysis prior myocardial infarction (OR = 2.81, 95% CI = 1.12-7.04, p = 0.027), immunodeficiency (OR = 2.08, 95% CI = 1.02-4.25, p = 0.043), C-reactive protein (OR = 1.73, 95% CI = 1.32-2.33, p < 0.001) and AI-based COVID-19 severity score (OR = 1.08; 95% CI = 1.02-1.15, p = 0.013) appeared to be independent predictors of clinical deterioration. Personalized probability values were determined. AI-based COVID-19 severity score assessed at hospital admission can provide additional information about the prognosis of COVID-19, possibly serving as a useful tool for individualized risk-stratification.", "Sleep-stage classification is essential for sleep research. Various automatic judgment programs, including deep learning algorithms using artificial intelligence (AI), have been developed, but have limitations with regard to data format compatibility, human interpretability, cost, and technical requirements. We developed a novel program called GI-SleepNet, generative adversarial network (GAN)-assisted image-based sleep staging for mice that is accurate, versatile, compact, and easy to use. In this program, electroencephalogram and electromyography data are first visualized as images, and then classified into three stages (wake, NREM, and REM) by a supervised image learning algorithm. To increase its accuracy, we adopted GAN and artificially generated fake REM sleep data to equalize the number of stages. This resulted in improved accuracy, and as little as one mouse's data yielded significant accuracy. Due to its image-based nature, the program is easy to apply to data of different formats, different species of animals, and even outside sleep research. Image data can be easily understood; thus, confirmation by experts is easily obtained, even when there are prediction anomalies. As deep learning in image processing is one of the leading fields in AI, numerous algorithms are also available.", "Over recent decades, a new antibiotic crisis has been unfolding due to a decreased research in this domain, a low return of investment for the companies that developed the drug, a lengthy and difficult research process, a low success rate for candidate molecules, an increased use of antibiotics in farms and an overall inappropriate use of antibiotics. This has led to a series of pathogens developing antibiotic resistance, which poses severe threats to public health systems while also driving up the costs of hospitalization and treatment. Moreover, without proper action and collaboration between academic and health institutions, a catastrophic trend might develop, with the possibility of returning to a pre-antibiotic era. Nevertheless, new emerging AI-based technologies have started to enter the field of antibiotic and drug development, offering a new perspective to an ever-growing problem. Cheaper and faster research can be achieved through algorithms that identify hit compounds, thereby further accelerating the development of new antibiotics, which represents a vital step in solving the current antibiotic crisis. The aim of this review is to provide an extended overview of the current artificial intelligence-based technologies that are used for antibiotic discovery, together with their technological and economic impact on the industrial sector.", "To compare the accuracy of cephalometric landmark identification between artificial intelligence (AI) deep learning convolutional neural networks (CNN) You Only Look Once, Version 3 (YOLOv3) algorithm and the manually traced (MT) group.\nThe American Association of Orthodontists Federation (AAOF) Legacy Denver collection was used to obtain 110 cephalometric images for this study.\nLateral cephalograms were digitized and traced by a calibrated senior orthodontic resident using Dolphin Imaging. The same images were uploaded to AI software Ceppro DDH Inc The Cartesian system of coordinates with Sella as the reference landmark was used to extract x- and y-coordinates for 16 cephalometric points: Nasion (Na), A point, B point, Menton (Me), Gonion (Go), Upper incisor tip, Lower incisor tip, Upper incisor apex, Lower incisor apex, Anterior Nasal Spine (ANS), Posterior Nasal Spine (PNS), Pogonion (Pg), Pterigomaxillary fissure point (Pt), Basion (Ba), Articulare (Art) and Orbitale (Or). The mean distances were assessed relative to the reference value of 2\u00a0mm. Student paired t-tests at significance level of P\u00a0<\u00a0.05 were used to compare the mean differences in each of the x- and y-components. SPSS (IBM-vs. 27.0) software was used for the data analysis.\nThere was no statistical difference for 12 out of 16 points when analysing absolute differences between MT and AI groups.\nAI may increase efficiency without compromising accuracy with cephalometric tracings in routine clinical practice and in research settings.", "The growing world population has increased the demand for animal-sourced protein. However, animal farming productivity is faced with challenges from traditional farming practices, socioeconomic status, and climate change. In recent years, smart sensors, big data, and deep learning have been applied to animal welfare measurement and livestock farming applications, including behaviour recognition and health monitoring. In order to facilitate research in this area, this review summarises and analyses some main techniques used in smart livestock farming, focusing on those related to cattle lameness detection and behaviour recognition. In this study, more than 100 relevant papers on cattle lameness detection and behaviour recognition have been evaluated and discussed. Based on a review and a comparison of recent technologies and methods, we anticipate that intelligent perception for cattle behaviour and welfare monitoring will develop towards standardisation, a larger scale, and intelligence, combined with Internet of things (IoT) and deep learning technologies. In addition, the key challenges and opportunities of future research are also highlighted and discussed.", "High-speed nanoindentation rapidly generates large datasets, opening the door for advanced data analysis methods such as the resources available in artificial intelligence. The present study addresses the problem of differentiating load-displacement curves presenting pop-in, slope changes, or instabilities from curves exhibiting a typical loading path in large nanoindentation datasets. Classification of the curves was achieved with a deep learning model, specifically, a convolutional neural network (CNN) model implemented in Python using TensorFlow and Keras libraries. Load-displacement curves (with pop-in and without pop-in) from various materials were input to train and validate the model. The curves were converted into square matrices (50 \u00d7 50) and then used as inputs for the CNN model. The model successfully differentiated between pop-in and non-pop-in curves with approximately 93% accuracy in the training and validation datasets, indicating that the risk of overfitting the model was negligible. These results confirmed that artificial intelligence and computer vision models represent a powerful tool for analyzing nanoindentation data.", "Ghost imaging is an indirect optical imaging technique, which retrieves object information by calculating the intensity correlation between reference and bucket signals. However, in existing correlation functions, a high number of measurements is required to acquire a satisfied performance, and the increase in measurement number only leads to limited improvement in image quality. Here, inspired by the gradient descent idea that is widely used in artificial intelligence, we propose a gradient-descent-like ghost imaging method to recursively move towards the optimal solution of the preset objective function, which can efficiently reconstruct high-quality images. The feasibility of this technique has been demonstrated in both numerical simulation and optical experiments, where the image quality is greatly improved within finite steps. Since the correlation function in the iterative formula is replaceable, this technique offers more possibilities for image reconstruction of ghost imaging.", "The purpose of this study was to reveal the peculiarities of undergraduate studies university student-athletes' emotional intelligence and self-control indicators, and the role of gender as a predictor in the association between emotional intelligence and self-control. The study included students regularly involved in training at least three times a week. The sample consisted of 1395 student athletes from Lithuanian universities, among them 59.2% female and 40.8% male. For measurement, the SSRI inventory and a self-control scale were used. All values of emotional intelligence indicators were significantly higher for males than females. Estimates of the components of the self-control construct varied. The score for the healthy habits component was significantly higher for women than for men, the self-discipline component did not differ significantly, and the other three components were higher for males. Estimates of the components of the self-control construct varied. Models for predicting the values of self-control components were proposed. Only one component of the emotional intelligence construct, optimism, was repeated in all forecasting models, as well as gender. Other components of emotional intelligence vary in models.", "Data on long-term outcomes in the era before therapeutic hypothermia (TH) showed a higher incidence of cognitive problems. Since the introduction of TH, data on its results are limited.\nOur sample population consisted of 40 children with a history of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) treated with TH, with an average age of 6.25 years (range 5.5, 7.33), 24 (60%) males; and 33 peers with an average age of 8.8 years (6.08, 9.41), 17 (51%) males. Long-term follow-up data belong to two centers in Padova and Torino. We measured general intelligence (WPPSI-III or WISC-IV) and neuropsychological functioning (language, attention, memory, executive functions, social skills, visual motor abilities). We also administered questionnaires to their parents on the children's psychopathological profiles and parental stress.\nWe found differences between groups in several cognitive and neuropsychological domains: intelligence, visuomotor skills, executive functions, and attention. Interestingly, IQ test results effectively differentiated between the groups (HIE vs. controls). Furthermore, the incidence of psychopathology appears to be significantly higher in children with HIE (35%) than in control peers (12%).\nOur study supports previous findings on a higher incidence of neuropsychological, cognitive, and psychopathological sequelae after HIE treated with TH. As hypothesized, TH does not appear to ameliorate the outcome after neonatal HIE in those children who survive without major sequelae.", "Nursing education in Taiwan has evolved from the hospital-based nursing programs of the prewar era to today`s school-based education (Yeh, 2014), while the pedagogy utilized in nursing education has similarly transitioned from traditional apprenticeships to school-based education. Nursing faculty engage in knowledge transformation and skills demonstrations in hopes of producing practice-ready graduates who meet the needs of their time. However, new graduates often experience difficulties in transitioning into practice settings. They tend to engage in passive learning and are inadequately prepared on competencies such as problem-solving and critical thinking. Thus, they are not fully equipped to manage diverse clinical situations. In 2006, the Taiwan Ministry of Education established the Taiwan Nursing Accreditation Council, which subsequently proposed eight core competencies of nursing education as a guide for cultivating excellent professional nurses. While traditional approaches remain the mainstream pedagogy, clinical scenarios have been integrated into the nursing curriculum. Clinical simulation in conjunction with objectively structured clinical examinations has been implemented in all nursing programs and even been used to determine eligibility for graduation. Problem-based learning, experiential learning, game-based learning, the flipped classroom approach, and technology integration (such as virtual reality and augmented reality) are developing trends in innovative teaching approaches and educational reform strategies. Specifically, authentic technology-integrated education is the current direction for nursing education. Furthermore, resolving nursing clinical dilemmas with design thinking and the creation of new products are also guiding the development of the nursing profession. Applications of these innovative teaching approaches are intended to reduce the gap between practice and theory. Because of the rapid advancement of information technology, big data and artificial intelligence have become unstoppable. Examples include clinical implementations of Line chatbot and the constant development of knowledge through artificial intelligence. The impact of these technological advancements on the nursing profession cannot be ignored. Nursing education is progressing away from traditional teaching approaches and focusing increasingly on the cultivation of professional nurses. Nevertheless, as nurse educators, we need to reflect whether our educational approaches remain overly limited by the traditional framework and, if so, whether we are preparing our future nurses for the past? It is our professional responsibility to prepare the nursing workforce for the present and the future (Murray, 2018). The knowledge required for developing artificial intelligence and relevant technologies is distinctly different from the knowledge required for the nursing profession. Nurse educators must contemplate strategies for leading the new generation of nursing students to be in line with current trends and reflect constantly on the essence and goals of nursing education. We must relentlessly learn new knowledge, align ourselves with the pulse of the times, develop innovative educational strategies, and engage in interprofessional collaboration to produce effective and wise nursing professionals.\n\u8b77\u7406\u6559\u80b2\u7684\u9769\u65b0\u2014\u591a\u5143\u5275\u65b0\u6559\u5b78\u7684\u767c\u5c55\u8207\u5be6\u8e10.\n\u56de\u9867\u6574\u500b\u8b77\u7406\u6559\u80b2\u7684\u767c\u5c55\uff0c\u5f9e\u65e9\u671f\u65e5\u64da\u6642\u4ee3\u7531\u91ab\u9662\u8a2d\u7f6e\u770b\u8b77\u5a66\u990a\u6210\u6240\u57f9\u8a13\u8b77\u7406\u4eba\u54e1\uff0c\u6f38\u6f38\u5730\u7531\u5b78\u6821\u57f9\u8a13\u8b77\u7406\u4eba\u54e1\uff08\u5f35\uff0c2014\uff09\u3002\u8b77\u7406\u6559\u80b2\u7684\u8a13\u7df4\u4e5f\u7531\u50b3\u7d71\u7684\u5e2b\u5f92\u5236\uff0c\u6539\u70ba\u4ee5\u5b78\u6821\u6559\u80b2\u70ba\u4e3b\u3002\u5728\u904e\u53bb\uff0c\u5b78\u6821\u6559\u80b2\u5e38\u4ee5\u8b1b\u8ff0\u6559\u5b78\u8207\u6280\u8853\u56de\u8986\u793a\u6559\u8a13\u7df4\u5b78\u751f\uff0c\u671f\u671b\u5b78\u751f\u7562\u696d\u5f8c\u80fd\u8207\u81e8\u5e8a\u63a5\u8ecc\u3002\u7136\u800c\u5982\u6b64\u7684\u8a13\u7df4\uff0c\u5728\u5be6\u52d9\u4e0a\u537b\u9010\u6f38\u767c\u73fe\u5b78\u751f\u7562\u696d\u5f8c\u6709\u56f0\u96e3\u8207\u81e8\u5e8a\u63a5\u8ecc\uff0c\u5b78\u751f\u7684\u5b78\u7fd2\u8f03\u70ba\u88ab\u52d5\uff0c\u7279\u5225\u662f\u7f3a\u4e4f\u554f\u984c\u89e3\u6c7a\u8207\u6279\u5224\u601d\u8003\u7b49\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u800c\u7121\u6cd5\u56e0\u61c9\u81e8\u5e8a\u591a\u5143\u7684\u60c5\u5883\uff0c\u65452006\u5e74\u7531\u6559\u80b2\u90e8\u6838\u53ef\u8a2d\u7acb\u53f0\u7063\u8b77\u7406\u6559\u80b2\u8a55\u9451\u59d4\u54e1\u6703\uff08Taiwan

"Artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming an integral part of drug discovery. It has the potential to deliver across the drug discovery and development value chain, starting from target identification and reaching through clinical development. In this review, we provide an overview of current AI technologies and a glimpse of how AI is reimagining preclinical drug discovery by highlighting examples where AI has made a real impact. Considering the excitement and hyperbole surrounding AI in drug discovery, we aim to present a realistic view by discussing both opportunities and challenges in adopting AI in drug discovery.", "The human right ventricle is barely monitored during open-chest surgery due to the absence of intraoperative imaging techniques capable of elaborating its complex function. Accordingly, artificial intelligence could not be adopted for this specific task. We recently proposed a video-based approach for the real-time evaluation of the epicardial kinematics to support medical decisions. Here, we employed two supervised machine learning algorithms based on our technique to predict the patients' outcomes before chest closure. Videos of the beating hearts were acquired before and after pulmonary valve replacement in twelve Tetralogy of Fallot patients and recordings were properly labeled as the \"unhealthy\" and \"healthy\" classes. We extracted frequency-domain-related features to train different supervised machine learning models and selected their best characteristics via 10-fold cross-validation and optimization processes. Decision surfaces were built to classify two additional patients having good and unfavorable clinical outcomes. The k-nearest neighbors and support vector machine showed the highest prediction accuracy; the patients' class was identified with a true positive rate \u226595% and the decision surfaces correctly classified the additional patients in the \"healthy\" (good outcome) or \"unhealthy\" (unfavorable outcome) classes. We demonstrated that classifiers employed with our video-based technique may aid cardiac surgeons in decision making before chest closure.", "Noise power spectrum (NPS) is a commonly used performance metric to evaluate noise-reduction techniques (NRT) in imaging systems. The images reconstructed with and without an NRT can be compared via their NPS to better understand the NRT's effects on image noise. However, when comparing NPSs, simple visual assessments or a comparison of NPS peaks or medians are often used. These assessments make it difficult to objectively evaluate the effect of noise reduction across all spatial frequencies. In this work, we propose a new noise reduction profile (NRP) to facilitate a more complete and objective evaluation of NPSs for a range of NRTs used specifically in computed tomography (CT).\nThe homogeneous section of the ACR or Catphan phantoms was scanned on different CT scanners equipped with the following NRTs: AIDR3D, AiCE, ASiR, ASiR-V, TrueFidelity, iDose, SAFIRE, and ADMIRE. The images were then reconstructed with all strengths of each NRT in reference to the baseline filtered back projection (FBP) images. One set of the baseline FBP images was also processed with PixelShine, an NRT based on artificial intelligence. The NPSs of the images before and after noise reduction were calculated in both the xy-plane and along the z-direction. The difference in the logarithmic scale between each NPS (baseline FBP and NRT) was then calculated and deemed the NRP. Furthermore, the relationship between the NRP and NPS peak positions was mathematically analyzed.\nEach NRT has its own unique NRP. By comparing the NPS and NRP for each NRT, it was found that NRP is related to the peak shift of NPS. Additionally, under the assumption that the NPS has one peak and is differentiable, a relationship was mathematically derived between the slope of the NRP at the peak position of the NPS before noise reduction and the shift of the NPS peak position after noise reduction.\nA new metric, NRP, was proposed based on NPS to objectively evaluate and compare methods for noise reduction in CT. The NRP can be used to compare the effects of various NRTs on image noise in both the xy-plane and z-direction. It also enables unbiased assessment of the detailed noise reduction properties of each NRT over all relevant spatial frequencies.", "Major progress has been achieved to treat cancer patients and survival has improved considerably, even for stage-IV bone metastatic patients. Locomotive health has become a crucial issue for patient autonomy and quality of life. The centerpiece of the reflection lies in the fracture risk evaluation of bone metastasis to guide physician decision regarding physical activity, antiresorptive agent prescription, and local intervention by radiotherapy, surgery, and interventional radiology. A key mandatory step, since bone metastases may be asymptomatic and disseminated throughout the skeleton, is to identify the bone metastasis location by cartography, especially within weight-bearing bones. For every location, the fracture risk evaluation relies on qualitative approaches using imagery and scores such as Mirels and spinal instability neoplastic score (SINS). This approach, however, has important limitations and there is a need to develop new tools for bone metastatic and myeloma fracture risk evaluation. Personalized numerical simulation qCT-based imaging constitutes one of these emerging tools to assess bone tumoral strength and estimate the femoral and vertebral fracture risk. The next generation of numerical simulation and artificial intelligence will take into account multiple loadings to integrate movement and obtain conditions even closer to real-life, in order to guide patient rehabilitation and activity within a personalized-medicine approach.", "Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) is an increasingly common therapy for a large range of neurological disorders, such as abnormal movement disorders. The effectiveness of DBS in terms of controlling patient symptomatology has made this procedure increasingly used over the past few decades. Concurrently, the popularity of Machine Learning (ML), a subfield of artificial intelligence, has skyrocketed and its influence has more recently extended to medical domains such as neurosurgery. Despite its growing research interest, there has yet to be a literature review specifically on the use of ML in DBS. We have followed a fully systematic methodology to obtain a corpus of 73 papers. In each paper, we identified the clinical application, the type/amount of data used, the method employed, and the validation strategy, further decomposed into 12 different sub-categories. The papers overall illustrated some existing trends in how ML is used in the context of DBS, including the breath of the problem domain and evolving techniques, as well as common frameworks and limitations. This systematic review analyzes at a broad level how ML have been recently used to address clinical problems on DBS, giving insight into how these new computational methods are helping to push the state-of-the-art of functional neurosurgery. DBS clinical workflow is complex, involves many specialists, and raises several clinical issues which have partly been addressed with artificial intelligence. However, several areas remain and those that have been recently addressed with ML are by no means considered \"solved\" by the community nor are they closed to new and evolving methods.", "In Pakistan, medical professionals face multiple challenges comprising long, fixed working hours and workload overburdening, which leads to emotional fatigue. These conflicts in work-life scenarios, brought about by high work demands causing emotional exhaustion, can create a state of distress among the medical professionals. The present study investigates the association between work-family conflict (WFC), emotional intelligence (EI), and self-efficacy (SE) among medical practitioners during COVID-19 in Pakistan.\nThe study sample included 140 medical professionals from Rawalpindi and Islamabad. Cross-section correlational research design was used, and information was gathered employing online surveys through a purposive sampling technique. The scales utilized were the WFC, EI, and SE Scale.\nThe current study hypothesized a significant relationship between work-family conflict, general self-efficacy (GSE) and emotional intelligence among medical practitioners during COVID-19 in Pakistan. The results showed that those with more family-to-work conflict had less EI and GSE. Furthermore, findings uncovered that there is a significant positive relationship between EI and GSE.\nThe findings propose that it is important for medical professionals to have a high level of EI and GSE to navigate through the WFC more healthily. In future, awareness seminars could be arranged related to EI and its significance to stimulate the psychological well-being of medical professionals. Future studies could also consider other healthcare workers, including nurses and internees doing house jobs and other medical staff, as they are also exposed to several stresses due to the workload and family demands.", "99mTc-pertechnetate thyroid scintigraphy is a valid complementary avenue for evaluating thyroid disease in the clinic, the image feature of thyroid scintigram is relatively simple but the interpretation still has a moderate consistency among physicians. Thus, we aimed to develop an artificial intelligence (AI) system to automatically classify the four patterns of thyroid scintigram.\nWe collected 3087 thyroid scintigrams from center 1 to construct the training dataset (n\u2009=\u20092468) and internal validating dataset (n\u2009=\u2009619), and another 302 cases from center 2 as external validating datasets. Four pre-trained neural networks that included ResNet50, DenseNet169, InceptionV3, and InceptionResNetV2 were implemented to construct AI models. The models were trained separately with transfer learning. We evaluated each model's performance with metrics as following: accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), recall, precision, and F1-score.\nThe overall accuracy of four pre-trained neural networks in classifying four common uptake patterns of thyroid scintigrams all exceeded 90%, and the InceptionV3 stands out from others. It reached the highest performance with an overall accuracy of 92.73% for internal validation and 87.75% for external validation, respectively. As for each category of thyroid scintigrams, the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) was 0.986 for 'diffusely increased,' 0.997 for 'diffusely decreased,' 0.998 for 'focal increased,' and 0.945 for 'heterogeneous uptake' in internal validation, respectively. Accordingly, the corresponding performances also obtained an ideal result of 0.939, 1.000, 0.974, and 0.915 in external validation, respectively.\nDeep convolutional neural network-based AI model represented considerable performance in the classification of thyroid scintigrams, which may help physicians improve the interpretation of thyroid scintigrams more consistently and efficiently.", "Patients with back pain are common and present a challenge in everyday medical practice due to the multitude of possible causes and the individual effects of treatments. Predicting causes and therapy efficien cy with the help of artificial intelligence could improve and simplify the treatment. In an exemplary collective of 1000 conservatively treated back pain patients, it was investigated whether the prediction of therapy efficiency and the underlying diagnosis is possible by combining different artificial intelligence approaches. For this purpose, supervised and unsupervised artificial intelligence methods were analyzed and a methodology for combining the predictions was developed. Supervised AI is suitable for predicting therapy efficiency at the borderline of minimal clinical difference. Non-supervised AI can show patterns in the dataset. We can show that the identification of the underlying diagnostic groups only becomes possible through a combination of different AI approaches and the baseline data. The presented methodology for the combined application of artificial intelligence algorithms shows a transferable path to establish correlations in heterogeneous data sets when individual AI approaches only provide weak results.", "This article reviews the current evolution and future directions in PET/CT technology focusing on three areas: time of flight, image reconstruction, and data-driven gating. Image reconstruction is considered with advances in point spread function modelling, Bayesian penalised likelihood reconstruction, and artificial intelligence approaches. Data-driven gating is examined with reference to respiratory motion, cardiac motion, and head motion. For each of these technological advancements, theory will be briefly discussed, benefits of their use in routine practice will be detailed and potential future developments will be discussed. Representative clinical cases will be presented, demonstrating the huge opportunities given to the PET community by hardware and software advances in PET technology when it comes to lesion detection, disease characterization, accurate quantitation and quicker scans. Through this review, hospitals are encouraged to embrace, evaluate and appropriately implement the wide range of new PET technologies that are available now or in the near future, for the improvement of patient care.", "Previous studies have shown the relationship between mathematics anxiety and math performance in deaf students, but their inner influencing mechanism remains unclear.\nTo examine a moderated mediation model between mathematics anxiety and mathematical calculation, with intelligence as a moderator, and mathematics self-efficacy as a mediator.\nA sample of 247 deaf children from 2 special education schools and 247 hearing children (matched in intelligence) from one mainstream school in China completed computerized tests of intelligence and mathematical calculation and self-report questionnaires of mathematics anxiety and mathematics self-efficacy. Simple mediation analyses and moderated mediation analyses were conducted using PROCESS, and a simple slopes method was employed to plot the conditional indirect effects.\nThere was a significant negative correlation between mathematics anxiety and mathematical calculation, and between mathematics anxiety and mathematics self-efficacy in deaf children and hearing children. However, mathematics self-efficacy was positively associated with mathematical calculation in deaf children but not in hearing children, and the significantly negative relationship between mathematics anxiety and intelligence was observed only in deaf children but not in hearing children. Mathematics self-efficacy partially mediated the association between mathematics anxiety and mathematical calculation in deaf children; and the indirect effect between mathematics anxiety and mathematical calculation via mathematics self-efficacy was moderated by intelligence in deaf children but not in hearing children.\nThe results were discussed to illuminate the mechanism in relation to the practical implication for the intervention and early development of mathematics performance in deaf children.", "In vitro seed germination is a useful tool for developing a variety of biotechnologies, but cannabis has presented some challenges in uniformity and germination time, presumably due to the disinfection procedure. Disinfection and subsequent growth are influenced by many factors, such as media pH, temperature, as well as the types and levels of contaminants and disinfectants, which contribute independently and dynamically to system complexity and nonlinearity. Hence, artificial intelligence models are well suited to model and optimize this dynamic system. The current study was aimed to evaluate the effect of different types and concentrations of disinfectants (sodium hypochlorite, hydrogen peroxide) and immersion times on contamination frequency using the generalized regression neural network (GRNN), a powerful artificial neural network (ANN). The GRNN model had high prediction performance (R2 > 0.91) in both training and testing. Moreover, a genetic algorithm (GA) was subjected to the GRNN to find the optimal type and level of disinfectants and immersion time to determine the best methods for contamination reduction. According to the optimization process, 4.6% sodium hypochlorite along with 0.008% hydrogen peroxide for 16.81 min would result in the best outcomes. The results of a validation experiment demonstrated that this protocol resulted in 0% contamination as predicted, but germination rates were low and sporadic. However, using this sterilization protocol in combination with the scarification of in vitro cannabis seed (seed tip removal) resulted in 0% contamination and 100% seed germination within one week.", "Due to the high price of the product and the limitation of laboratory conditions, reliability tests often get a small number of failed samples. If the data are not handled properly, the reliability evaluation results will incur grave errors. In order to solve this problem, this work proposes an artificial intelligence (AI) enhanced reliability assessment methodology by combining Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) and differential evolution (DE) algorithms. First, a single hidden layer BNN model is constructed by fusing small samples and prior information to obtain the 95% confidence interval (CI) of the posterior distribution. Then, the DE algorithm is used to iteratively generate optimal virtual samples based on the 95% CI and small samples trends. A reliability assessment model is reconstructed based on double hidden layers BNN model by combining virtual samples and test samples in the last stage. In order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, an accelerated life test (ALT) of the subsurface electronic control unit (S-ECU) was carried out. The verification test results show that the proposed method can accurately evaluate the reliability life of a product. And compared with the two existing methods, the results show that this method can effectively improve the accuracy of the reliability assessment of a test product.", "Electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive technique used to record the brain's evoked and induced electrical activity from the scalp. Artificial intelligence, particularly machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms, are increasingly being applied to EEG data for pattern analysis, group membership classification, and brain-computer interface purposes. This study aimed to systematically review recent advances in ML and DL supervised models for decoding and classifying EEG signals. Moreover, this article provides a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art techniques used for EEG signal preprocessing and feature extraction. To this end, several academic databases were searched to explore relevant studies from the year 2000 to the present. Our results showed that the application of ML and DL in both mental workload and motor imagery tasks has received substantial attention in recent years. A total of 75% of DL studies applied convolutional neural networks with various learning algorithms, and 36% of ML studies achieved competitive accuracy by using a support vector machine algorithm. Wavelet transform was found to be the most common feature extraction method used for all types of tasks. We further examined the specific feature extraction methods and end classifier recommendations discovered in this systematic review.", "The death due to stroke is caused by embolism of the arteries which is due to the rupture of the atherosclerotic lesions in carotid arteries. The lesion formation is over time, and thus, early screening is recommended for asymptomatic and moderate-risk patients. The previous techniques adopted conventional methods or semi-automated and, more recently, machine learning solutions. A handful of studies have emerged based on solo deep learning (SDL) models such as UNet architecture.\nThe proposed research is the first to adopt hybrid deep learning (HDL) artificial intelligence models such as SegNet-UNet. This model is benchmarked against UNet and advanced conventional models using scale-space such as AtheroEdge 2.0 (AtheroPoint, CA, USA). All our resultant statistics of the three systems were in the order of UNet, SegNet-UNet, and AtheroEdge 2.0.\nUsing the database of 379 ultrasound scans from a Japanese cohort of 190 patients having moderate risk and implementing the cross-validation deep learning framework, our system performance using area-under-the-curve (AUC) for UNet, SegNet-UNet, and AtheroEdge 2.0 were 0.93, 0.94, and 0.95 (P<0.001), respectively. The coefficient of correlation between the three systems and ground truth (GT) were: 0.82, 0.89, and 0.85 (P<0.001 for all three), respectively. The mean absolute area error for the three systems against manual GT was 4.07\u00b14.70 mm2, 3.11\u00b13.92 mm2, 3.72\u00b14.76 mm2, respectively, proving the superior performance SegNet-UNet against UNet and AtheroEdge 2.0, respectively. Statistical tests were also conducted for their reliability and stability.\nThe proposed study demonstrates a fast, accurate, and reliable solution for early detection and quantification of plaque lesions in common carotid artery ultrasound scans. The system runs on a test US image in <1 second, proving overall performance to be clinically reliable.", "To assess a new application of artificial intelligence for real-time detection of laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) in both white light (WL) and narrow-band imaging (NBI) videolaryngoscopies based on the You-Only-Look-Once (YOLO) deep learning convolutional neural network (CNN).\nExperimental study with retrospective data.\nRecorded videos of LSCC were retrospectively collected from in-office transnasal videoendoscopies and intraoperative rigid endoscopies. LSCC videoframes were extracted for training, validation, and testing of various YOLO models. Different techniques were used to enhance the image analysis: contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization, data augmentation techniques, and test time augmentation (TTA). The best-performing model was used to assess the automatic detection of LSCC in six videolaryngoscopies.\nTwo hundred and nineteen patients were retrospectively enrolled. A total of 624 LSCC videoframes were extracted. The YOLO models were trained after random distribution of images into a training set (82.6%), validation set (8.2%), and testing set (9.2%). Among the various models, the ensemble algorithm (YOLOv5s with YOLOv5m-TTA) achieved the best LSCC detection results, with performance metrics in par with the results reported by other state-of-the-art detection models: 0.66 Precision (positive predicted value), 0.62 Recall (sensitivity), and 0.63 mean Average Precision at 0.5 intersection over union. Tests on the six videolaryngoscopies demonstrated an average computation time per videoframe of 0.026\u00a0seconds. Three demonstration videos are provided.\nThis study identified a suitable CNN model for LSCC detection in WL and NBI videolaryngoscopies. Detection performances are highly promising. The limited complexity and quick computational times for LSCC detection make this model ideal for real-time processing.\n3 Laryngoscope, 132:1798-1806, 2022.", "Disaster risk management (DRM) seeks to help societies prepare for, mitigate, or recover from the adverse impacts of disasters and climate change. Core to DRM are disaster risk models that rely heavily on geospatial data about the natural and built environments. Developers are increasingly turning to artificial intelligence (AI) to improve the quality of these models. Yet, there is still little understanding of how the extent of hidden geospatial biases affects disaster risk models and how accountability relationships are affected by these emerging actors and methods. In many cases, there is also a disconnect between the algorithm designers and the communities where the research is conducted or algorithms are implemented. This perspective highlights emerging concerns about the use of AI in DRM. We discuss potential concerns and illustrate what must be considered from a data science, ethical, and social perspective to ensure the responsible usage of AI in this field.", "Swarm intelligence is a discipline which makes use of a number of agents for solving optimization problems by producing low cost, fast and robust solutions. The dragonfly algorithm (DA), a recently proposed swarm intelligence algorithm, is inspired by the dynamic and static swarming behaviors of dragonflies, and it has been found to have a higher performance in comparison to other swarm intelligence and evolutionary algorithms in numerous applications. There are only a few surveys about the dragonfly algorithm, and we have found that they are limited in certain aspects. Hence, in this paper, we present a more comprehensive survey about DA, its applications in various domains, and its performance as compared to other swarm intelligence algorithms. We also analyze the hybrids of DA, the methods they employ to enhance the original DA, their performance as compared to the original DA, and their limitations. Moreover, we categorize the hybrids of DA according to the type of problem that they have been applied to, their objectives, and the methods that they utilize.", "One of the common limitations in the treatment of cancer is in the early detection of this disease. The customary medical practice of cancer examination is a visual examination by the dermatologist followed by an invasive biopsy. Nonetheless, this symptomatic approach is timeconsuming and prone to human errors. An automated machine learning model is essential to capacitate fast diagnoses and early treatment.\nThe key objective of this study is to establish a fully automatic model that helps Dermatologists in skin cancer handling process in a way that could improve skin lesion classification accuracy.\nThe work is conducted following an implementation of a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) using the Python-based deep learning library Keras. We incorporated effective image filtering and enhancement algorithms such as bilateral filter to enhance feature detection and extraction during training. The Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) needed slightly more fine-tuning to ripe a better return. Hyperparameter optimization was utilized for selecting the best-performed hyperparameter combinations and several network hyperparameters. In this work, we decreased the learning rate from the default 0.001 to 0.0002, and the momentum for Adam optimization algorithm from 0.9 to 0.5, in trying to reduce the instability issues related to GAN models and at each iteration the weights of the discriminative and generative network were updated to balance the loss between them. We endeavour to address a binary classification which predicts two classes present in our dataset, namely benign and malignant. More so, some wellknown metrics such as the receiver operating characteristic -area under the curve and confusion matrix were incorporated for evaluating the results and classification accuracy.\nThe model generated very conceivable lesions during the early stages of the experiment and we could easily visualise a smooth transition in resolution along the way. Thus, we have achieved an overall test accuracy of 93.5% after fine-tuning most parameters of our network.\nThis classification model provides spatial intelligence that could be useful in the future for cancer risk prediction. Unfortunately, it is difficult to generate high quality images that are much like the synthetic real samples and to compare different classification methods given the fact that some methods use non-public datasets for training.", "Success in all sorts of situations is the most classical interpretation of general intelligence. Under limited resources, however, the capability of an agent must necessarily be limited too, and generality needs to be understood as comprehensive performance up to a level of difficulty. The degree of generality then refers to the way an agent's capability is distributed as a function of task difficulty. This dissects the notion of general intelligence into two non-populational measures, generality and capability, which we apply to individuals and groups of humans, other animals and AI systems, on several cognitive and perceptual tests. Our results indicate that generality and capability can decouple at the individual level: very specialised agents can show high capability and vice versa. The metrics also decouple at the population level, and we rarely see diminishing returns in generality for those groups of high capability. We relate the individual measure of generality to traditional notions of general intelligence and cognitive efficiency in humans, collectives, non-human animals and machines. The choice of the difficulty function now plays a prominent role in this new conception of generality, which brings a quantitative tool for shedding light on long-standing questions about the evolution of general intelligence and the evaluation of progress in Artificial General Intelligence.", "Biological omics data such as transcriptomes and methylomes have the inherent \"large p small n\" paradigm, i.e., the number of features is much larger than that of the samples. A feature selection (FS) algorithm selects a subset of the transcriptomic or methylomic biomarkers in order to build a better prediction model. The hidden patterns in the FS solution space make it challenging to achieve a feature subset with satisfying prediction performances. Swarm intelligence (SI) algorithms mimic the target searching behaviors of various animals and have demonstrated promising capabilities in selecting features with good machine learning performances. Our study revealed that different SI-based feature selection algorithms contributed complementary searching capabilities in the FS solution space, and their collaboration generated a better feature subset than the individual SI feature selection algorithms. Nine SI-based feature selection algorithms were integrated to vote for the selected features, which were further refined by the dynamic recursive feature elimination framework. In most cases, the proposed Zoo algorithm outperformed the existing feature selection algorithms on transcriptomics and methylomics datasets.", "Objective numeracy, the ability to understand and use mathematical concepts, has been related to superior decisions and life outcomes. Unknown is whether it relates to greater satisfaction in life. We investigated numeracy's relations with income satisfaction and overall life satisfaction in a diverse sample of 5,525 American adults. First, more numerate individuals had higher incomes; for every one point higher on the eight-item numeracy test, individuals reported $4,062 more in annual income, controlling for education and verbal intelligence. Combined, numeracy, education, and verbal intelligence explained 25% of the variance in income while Big-5 personality traits explained less than 4%. Further, the higher incomes associated with greater numeracy were related to more positive life evaluations (income and life satisfaction). Second, extant research also has indicated that the highly numerate compare numbers more than the less numerate. Consistent with numeracy-related income comparisons, numeracy moderated the relation between income and life evaluations, meaning that the same income was valued differently by those better and worse at math. Specifically, among those with lower incomes, the highly numerate were less satisfied than the less numerate; this effect reversed among those with higher incomes as if the highly numerate were aware of and made comparisons to others' incomes. Further, no clear income satiation point was seen among those highest in numeracy, and satiation among the least numerate appeared to occur at a point below $50,000. Third, both education and verbal intelligence related to income evaluations in similar ways, and numeracy's relations held when controlling for these other relations. Although causal claims cannot be made from cross-sectional data, these novel results indicate that numeracy may be an important factor underlying life evaluations and especially for evaluations concerning numbers such as incomes. Finally, this study adds to our understanding of education and intelligence effects in life satisfaction and happiness.", "Rapid intraoperative diagnosis for unconfirmed pulmonary tumor is extremely important for determining the optimal surgical procedure (lobectomy or sublobar resection). Attempts to diagnose malignant tumors using mass spectrometry (MS) have recently been described. This study evaluated the usefulness of MS and artificial intelligence (AI) for differentiating primary lung adenocarcinoma (PLAC) and colorectal metastatic pulmonary tumor.\nPulmonary samples from 40 patients who underwent pulmonary resection for PLAC (20 tumors, 20 normal lungs) or pulmonary metastases originating from colorectal metastatic pulmonary tumor (CRMPT) (20 tumors, 20 normal lungs) were collected and analyzed retrospectively by probe electrospray ionization-MS. AI using random forest (RF) algorithms was employed to evaluate the accuracy of each combination.\nThe accuracy of the machine learning algorithm applied using RF to distinguish malignant tumor (PLAC or CRMPT) from normal lung was 100%. The algorithms offered 97.2% accuracy in differentiating PLAC and CRMPT.\nMS combined with an AI system demonstrated high accuracy not only for differentiating cancer from normal tissue, but also for differentiating between PLAC and CRMPT with a short working time. This method shows potential for application as a support tool facilitating rapid intraoperative diagnosis to determine the surgical procedure for pulmonary resection.", "To investigate emotional intelligence (EI) development in physician assistant (PA) students as they progress through their didactic education.\nData were gathered through an online survey of EI distributed to a purposeful sample of 5 institutions with similar curriculum length and start dates. Program directors forwarded the survey to students at the start of their didactic education (pretest). Follow-up surveys were distributed via email to the students at the end of their didactic education (posttest). The survey consisted of 33 items related to 4 subscales of EI. Participants' age, gender, and previous healthcare experience were gathered. Five repeated measures ANOVAs were calculated for each EI summary score. Independent sample t-tests were conducted between pretest scores and a previously established EI mean.\nA total of 192 first-year students were solicited. A sample of 68 (16 males; 52 females) served as participants. No results were attained for gender or age due to unbalanced sample sizes. Significant results were realized for total EI and the Managing Others' Emotions subscale.\nParticipants with more than one healthcare experience demonstrated significantly high emotional intelligence on the pretest. Participants with one healthcare experience demonstrated a significant increase in total EI and the Managing Others' Emotions subscale. The main limitation of the study was the attrition of participants between measures. Future research is needed to assess EI at the end of the clinical year, after a period of clinical experience, and to determine which educational activities are most likely to enhance EI.", "Breast fibroepithelial lesions (FEL) are biphasic tumors which consist of benign fibroadenomas (FAs) and the rarer phyllodes tumors (PTs). FAs and PTs have overlapping features, but have different clinical management, which makes correct core biopsy diagnosis important. This study used whole-slide images (WSIs) of 187 FA and 100 PT core biopsies, to investigate the potential role of artificial intelligence (AI) in FEL diagnosis. A total of 9228 FA patches and 6443 PT patches was generated from WSIs of the training subset, with each patch being 224\u2009\u00d7\u2009224 pixel in size. Our model employed a two-stage architecture comprising a convolutional neural network (CNN) component for feature extraction from the patches, and a recurrent neural network (RNN) component for whole-slide classification using activation values from the global average pooling layer in the CNN model. It achieved an overall slide-level accuracy of 87.5%, with accuracies of 80% and 95% for FA and PT slides respectively. This affirms the potential role of AI in diagnostic discrimination between FA and PT on core biopsies which may be further refined for use in routine practice.", "Cognitive flexibility has been hypothesized to be neurochemically rooted in dopamine neurotransmission. Nonetheless, underpowered sample sizes and contradictory meta-analytic findings have obscured the role of dopamine genes in cognitive flexibility and neglected potential gene-gene interactions. In this largest neurocognitive-genetic study to date (n = 1400), single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with elevated prefrontal dopamine levels (catechol-O-methyltransferase; rs4680) and diminished striatal dopamine (C957T; rs6277) were both implicated in Wisconsin Card Sorting Test performance. Crucially, however, these genetic effects were only evident in low-IQ participants, suggesting high intelligence compensates for, and eliminates, the effect of dispositional dopamine functioning on flexibility. This interaction between cognitive systems may explain and resolve previous empirical inconsistencies in highly educated participant samples. Moreover, compensatory gene-gene interactions were discovered between catechol-O-methyltransferase and DRD2, such that genotypes conferring either elevated prefrontal dopamine or diminished striatal dopamine-via heightened striatally concentrated D2 dopamine receptor availability-are sufficient for cognitive flexibility, but neither is necessary. The study has therefore revealed a form of epistatic redundancy or substitutability among dopamine systems in shaping adaptable thought and action, thus defining boundary conditions for dopaminergic effects on flexible behavior. These results inform theories of clinical disorders and psychopharmacological interventions and uncover complex fronto-striatal synergies in human flexible cognition.", "The growing maturity of nanofabrication has ushered massive sophisticated optical structures available on a photonic chip. The integration of subwavelength-structured metasurfaces and metamaterials on the canonical building block of optical waveguides is gradually reshaping the landscape of photonic integrated circuits, giving rise to numerous meta-waveguides with unprecedented strength in controlling guided electromagnetic waves. Here, we review recent advances in meta-structured waveguides that synergize various functional subwavelength photonic architectures with diverse waveguide platforms, such as dielectric or plasmonic waveguides and optical fibers. Foundational results and representative applications are comprehensively summarized. Brief physical models with explicit design tutorials, either physical intuition-based design methods or computer algorithms-based inverse designs, are cataloged as well. We highlight how meta-optics can infuse new degrees of freedom to waveguide-based devices and systems, by enhancing light-matter interaction strength to drastically boost device performance, or offering a versatile designer media for manipulating light in nanoscale to enable novel functionalities. We further discuss current challenges and outline emerging opportunities of this vibrant field for various applications in photonic integrated circuits, biomedical sensing, artificial intelligence and beyond.", "Developmental dyslexia is defined by reading impairments that are disproportionate to intelligence, motivation, and the educational opportunities considered necessary for reading. Its cause has traditionally been considered to be a phonological deficit, where people have difficulties with differentiating the sounds of spoken language. However, reading is a multidimensional skill and relies on various cognitive abilities. These may include high-level vision-the processes that support visual recognition despite innumerable image variations, such as in viewpoint, position, or size. According to our high-level visual dysfunction hypothesis, reading problems of some people with dyslexia can be a salient manifestation of a more general deficit of high-level vision. This paper provides a perspective on how such non-phonological impairments could, in some cases, cause dyslexia. To argue in favor of this hypothesis, we will discuss work on functional neuroimaging, structural imaging, electrophysiology, and behavior that provides evidence for a link between high-level visual impairment and dyslexia.", "Recently, the integrated control hypothesis (Lu et al., 2020) was proposed to explain the relationship between fluid intelligence (Gf) and attentional resource allocation. This hypothesis suggested that individuals with higher Gf tend to flexibly and adaptively allocate their limited resources according to the task type and task difficulty rather than simply exert more or fewer resources in any condition. To examine this hypothesis, the present study used electroencephalogram (EEG) indicators (i.e., frontal theta-ERS and parietal-occipital alpha-ERD) as the measurements of participants' resource allocation during the exploration task and exploitation task with different difficulties. The results found that higher Gf individuals tend to allocate fewer resources in all difficulty levels in the exploitation task compared to average Gf participants. In contrast, in the exploration task, higher Gf participants would allocate more resources in the medium- and high-difficulty levels than average Gf participants, but this phenomenon was only found in males. These findings provided supportive evidence for the integrated control hypothesis that flexible and adaptive attentional control ability are important characteristics of human intelligence.", "Capsule endoscopy (CE) is the first line for evaluation of patients with obscure gastrointestinal bleeding. A wide range of small intestinal vascular lesions with different hemorrhagic potential are frequently found in these patients. Nevertheless, reading CE exams is time-consuming and prone to errors. Convolutional neural networks (CNN) are artificial intelligence tools with high performance levels in image analysis. This study aimed to develop a CNN-based model for identification and differentiation of vascular lesions with distinct hemorrhagic potential in CE images.\nThe development of the CNN was based on a database of CE images. This database included images of normal small intestinal mucosa, red spots, and angiectasia/varices. The hemorrhagic risk was assessed by Saurin's classification. For CNN development, 11,588 images (9525 normal mucosa, 1026 red spots, and 1037 angiectasia/varices) were ultimately extracted. Two image datasets were created for CNN training and testing.\nThe network was 91.8% sensitive and 95.9% specific for detection of vascular lesions, providing accurate predictions in 94.4% of cases. In particular, the CNN had a sensitivity and specificity of 97.1% and 95.3%, respectively, for detection of red spots. Detection of angiectasia/varices occurred with a sensitivity of 94.1% and a specificity of 95.1%. The CNN had a frame reading rate of 145 frames/sec.\nThe developed algorithm is the first CNN-based model to accurately detect and distinguish enteric vascular lesions with different hemorrhagic risk. CNN-assisted CE reading may improve the diagnosis of these lesions and overall CE efficiency.", "The number, duration and depth of social relationships that an individual maintains can impact social cognition, but the connection between sociality and other aspects of cognition has hardly been explored. To date, the link between social living and intelligence has been mainly supported by studies on primates, and far fewer tests connecting sociality to cognitive abilities have used other taxa. Here, we present the first comparative study in fishes that examines whether complex social living is associated with better performance on a cognitively demanding spatial task. Using three cooperative, group-living cichlid fish species and three of their non-cooperative, more solitary close relatives, we studied maze learning and employed a new statistical extension for the 'lme4' and 'glmmTMB' packages in R that allows phylogeny to be included as a random effect term. Across trials, the three cooperative and the three non-cooperative species completed the maze faster, made fewer mistakes, and improved their inhibitory control. Although fish improved their performance, we did not detect any differences in the extent of improvement between cooperative and non-cooperative species. Both the cooperative species and the non-cooperative species took similar amounts of time to complete the maze, had comparable numbers of mistakes, and exhibited similar inhibitory control while in the maze. Our results suggest that living and breeding in complex social groups does not necessarily imply enhancement of other forms of cognition nor, more specifically, an enhanced spatial learning capacity.", "Liquid biopsy is a minimally invasive collection of a patient body fluid sample. In oncology, they offer several advantages compared to traditional tissue biopsies. However, the potential of this method in endometrial cancer (EC) remains poorly explored. We studied the utility of tumor educated platelets (TEPs) and circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) for preoperative EC diagnosis, including histology determination.\nTEPs from 295 subjects (53 EC patients, 38 patients with benign gynecologic conditions, and 204 healthy women) were RNA-sequenced. DNA sequencing data were obtained for 519 primary tumor tissues and 16 plasma samples. Artificial intelligence was applied to sample classification.\nPlatelet-dedicated classifier yielded AUC of 97.5% in the test set when discriminating between healthy subjects and cancer patients. However, the discrimination between endometrial cancer and benign gynecologic conditions was more challenging, with AUC of 84.1%. ctDNA-dedicated classifier discriminated primary tumor tissue samples with AUC of 96% and ctDNA blood samples with AUC of 69.8%.\nLiquid biopsies show potential in EC diagnosis. Both TEPs and ctDNA profiles coupled with artificial intelligence constitute a source of useful information. Further work involving more cases is warranted.", "The domain of policymaking, which used to be limited to small groups of specialists, is now increasingly opening up to the participation of wide collectives, which are not only influencing government decisions, but also enhancing citizen engagement and transparency, improving service delivery and gathering the distributed wisdom of diverse participants. Although collective intelligence has become a more common approach to policymaking, the studies on this subject have not been conducted in a systematic way. Nevertheless, we hypothesized that methods and strategies specific to different types of studies in this field could be identified and analyzed. Based on a systematic literature review, as well as qualitative and statistical analyses, we identified 15 methods and revealed the dependencies between them. The review indicated the most popular approaches, and the underrepresented ones that can inspire future research.", "Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) seriously threatens human health. About 820,000 deaths annually are due to related complications such as hepatitis B and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Recently, the use of oral antiviral agents has significantly improved the prognosis of patients with CHB infection and reduced the risk of HCC. However, hepatitis B virus still remains a major factor in the development of HCC, raising many concerns. Therefore, numerous studies have been conducted to assess the risk of HCC in patients with CHB infection and many models have been proposed to predict the risk of developing HCC. However, as each study has different models for predicting HCC development that can be applied depending on the use of antiviral agents or the type of antiviral agents, it is necessary to properly understand characteristics of each model when using it for the evaluation of HCC in patients with CHB infection. In addition, because different variables such as host factor, viral activity, and cirrhosis are used to evaluate the risk of HCC development, it is necessary to assess the risk by carefully verifying which variables are used. Recently, studies have also evaluated the risk of HCC using risk prediction models through transient elastography and artificial intelligence (AI) system. These HCC risk predication models are also noteworthy. In this review, we aimed to compare HCC risk prediction models in patients with CHB infection reported to date to confirm variables used and specificity between each model to determine an appropriate HCC risk prediction method.", "This study used explainable artificial intelligence for data-driven identification of extrastriatal brain regions that can contribute to the interpretation of dopamine transporter SPECT with 123I-FP-CIT in parkinsonian syndromes. A total of 1306 123I-FP-CIT-SPECT were included retrospectively. Binary classification as 'reduced' or 'normal' striatal 123I-FP-CIT uptake by an experienced reader served as standard-of-truth. A custom-made 3-dimensional convolutional neural network (CNN) was trained for classification of the SPECT images with 1006 randomly selected images in three different settings: \"full image\", \"striatum only\" (3-dimensional region covering the striata cropped from the full image), \"without striatum\" (full image with striatal region removed). The remaining 300 SPECT images were used to test the CNN classification performance. Layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) was used for voxelwise quantification of the relevance for the CNN-based classification in this test set. Overall accuracy of CNN-based classification was 97.0%, 95.7%, and 69.3% in the \"full image\", \"striatum only\", and \"without striatum\" setting. Prominent contributions in the LRP-based relevance maps beyond the striatal signal were detected in insula, amygdala, ventromedial prefrontal cortex, thalamus, anterior temporal cortex, superior frontal lobe, and pons, suggesting that 123I-FP-CIT uptake in these brain regions provides clinically useful information for the differentiation of neurodegenerative and non-neurodegenerative parkinsonian syndromes.", "In this work, we obtain extremely low confinement-loss (CL) anti-resonant fibers (ARFs) via swarm intelligence, specifically the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. We construct a complex search space of ARFs with two layers of cladding and nested tubes. There are three and four structures of cladding tubes in the first and second layer, respectively. The ARFs are optimized by using the PSO algorithm in terms of both the structures and the parameters. The optimal structure is obtained from a total of 415900 ARFs structures, with the lowest CL being 2.839\u00d710-7 dB/m at a wavelength of 1.55 \u00b5m. We observe that the number of ARF structures with CL less than 1\u00d710-6 dB/m in our search space is 370. These structures mainly comprise four designs of ARFs. The results show that the optimal ARF structures realized by the PSO algorithm are different from the ARFs reported in the previous literature. This means that the swarm intelligence accelerates the design and invention of ARFs and also provides new insights regarding the ARF structures. This work provides a fast and effective approach to design ARFs with special requirements. In addition to providing high-performance ARF structures, this work transforms the ARF designs from experience-driven to data-driven.", "Our objective was to perform two studies: a cross-sectional study in order to identify the main psychological variables associated to treatment adherence in rheumatoid arthritis and an intervention based on psychoeducation to assess its impact on the variables identified in the first study. We measured treatment adherence, self-efficacy, beliefs about medication, emotional intelligence and disability along with personal and disease variables in the cross-sectional study and the same variables were measured in the intervention before and after the program and 3 months later in 2 groups (an experimental group and an active control group). In the cross-sectional study (N=33) we found that the variables most associated with treatment adherence were emotional clarity (r=0.352, p<0.05) and emotional repair (r=0.363, p<0.05). In the intervention, we divided the patients into 2 groups: the control group (N=7) and the intervention group (N=10). At the end of the study and at follow-up, we found a significant increase in adherence and self-efficacy in the intervention group, when compared with the control group. Emotional clarity was increased only in the post-test, and at follow up a decrease in beliefs of concern about medication was found. Psychoeducational programs based on information about the disease and its treatment together with emotional management are effective in increasing treatment adherence in the long term.", "The COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact people worldwide-steadily depleting scarce resources in healthcare. Medical Artificial Intelligence (AI) promises a much-needed relief but only if the technology gets adopted at scale. The present research investigates people's intention to adopt medical AI as well as the drivers of this adoption in a representative study of two European countries (Denmark and France, N = 1068) during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. Results reveal AI aversion; only 1 of 10 individuals choose medical AI over human physicians in a hypothetical triage-phase of COVID-19 pre-hospital entrance. Key predictors of medical AI adoption are people's trust in medical AI and, to a lesser extent, the trait of open-mindedness. More importantly, our results reveal that mistrust and perceived uniqueness neglect from human physicians, as well as a lack of social belonging significantly increase people's medical AI adoption. These results suggest that for medical AI to be widely adopted, people may need to express less confidence in human physicians and to even feel disconnected from humanity. We discuss the social implications of these findings and propose that successful medical AI adoption policy should focus on trust building measures-without eroding trust in human physicians.", "The Internet of Food Things Network+ (IoFT) and the Artificial Intelligence and Augmented Intelligence for Automated Investigation for Scientific Discovery Network+ (AI3SD) brought together an interdisciplinary multi-institution working group to create an ethical framework for digital collaboration in the food industry. This will enable the exploration of implications and consequences (both intentional and unintentional) of using cutting-edge technologies to support the implementation of data trusts and other forms of digital collaboration in the food sector. This article describes how we identified areas for ethical consideration with respect to digital collaboration and the use of Industry 4.0 technologies in the food sector and describes the different interdisciplinary methodologies being used to produce this framework. The research questions and objectives that are being addressed by the working group are laid out, with a report on our ongoing work. The article concludes with recommendations about working on projects in this area.", "The 'Ending the HIV Epidemic (EHE)' national plan aims to reduce annual HIV incidence in the United States from 38,000 in 2015 to 9300 by 2025 and 3300 by 2030. Diagnosis and treatment are two most effective interventions, and thus, identifying corresponding optimal combinations of testing and retention-in-care rates would help inform implementation of relevant programs. Considering the dynamic and stochastic complexity of the disease and the time dynamics of decision-making, solving for optimal combinations using commonly used methods of parametric optimization or exhaustive evaluation of pre-selected options are infeasible. Reinforcement learning (RL), an artificial intelligence method, is ideal; however, training RL algorithms and ensuring convergence to optimality are computationally challenging for large-scale stochastic problems. We evaluate its feasibility in the context of the EHE goal. We trained an RL algorithm to identify a 'sequence' of combinations of HIV-testing and retention-in-care rates at 5-year intervals over 2015-2070 that optimally leads towards HIV elimination. We defined optimality as a sequence that maximizes quality-adjusted-life-years lived and minimizes HIV-testing and care-and-treatment costs. We show that solving for testing and retention-in-care rates through appropriate reformulation using proxy decision-metrics overcomes the computational challenges of RL. We used a stochastic agent-based simulation to train the RL algorithm. As there is variability in support-programs needed to address barriers to care-access, we evaluated the sensitivity of optimal decisions to three cost-functions. The model suggests to scale-up retention-in-care programs to achieve and maintain high annual retention-rates while initiating with a high testing-frequency but relaxing it over a 10-year period as incidence decreases. Results were mainly robust to the uncertainty in costs. However, testing and retention-in-care alone did not achieve the 2030 EHE targets, suggesting the need for additional interventions. The results from the model demonstrated convergence. RL is suitable for evaluating phased public health decisions for infectious disease control.", "Cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia are reported to be minimally responsive to treatment with antipsychotic medications, though variability exists and many prior studies have significant confounds. Here, we examined the response of cognitive symptoms to antipsychotic medications in 71 inpatients with schizophrenia on and off antipsychotic medications in a blinded, placebo-controlled, cross-over study design. Patients received either antipsychotic medication monotherapy or placebo for 4-6\u00a0weeks before switching conditions. Neuropsychological testing, including working memory, intelligence, episodic memory, and verbal fluency tests, was administered during each condition. Additionally, we assessed whether polygenic scores for cognitive ability (PGScog) related to variability in antipsychotic medication-induced changes in cognitive performance. Overall, significant changes in cognition were not observed in response to medications (p's\u00a0>\u00a00.05) except for in episodic memory (p\u00a0=\u00a00.01), which showed a medication-related improvement. Some antipsychotic medication-related cognitive changes were associated with genetic predisposition to cognitive ability: PGScog showed positive correlations with medication-induced improvements in verbal list learning (p\u00a0=\u00a00.02) and category fluency (p\u00a0=\u00a00.03). Our primary results reinforce the notion that in general, cognitive measures are minimally responsive to antipsychotic medication. However, PGScog results suggest that genetic variation may influence the ability of current treatments to affect cognitive change within this patient population. This study underscores the need for development of novel treatment options specifically targeting cognitive symptoms as well as the importance of genetic variability in treatment response for patients with schizophrenia.", "Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is a leading cause of childhood blindness. Screening and treatment reduces this risk, but requires multiple examinations of infants, most of whom will not develop severe disease. Previous work has suggested that artificial intelligence may be able to detect incident severe disease (treatment-requiring retinopathy of prematurity [TR-ROP]) before clinical diagnosis. We aimed to build a risk model that combined artificial intelligence with clinical demographics to reduce the number of examinations without missing cases of TR-ROP.\nInfants undergoing routine ROP screening examinations (1579 total eyes, 190 with TR-ROP) were recruited from 8 North American study centers. A vascular severity score (VSS) was derived from retinal fundus images obtained at 32 to 33 weeks' postmenstrual age. Seven ElasticNet logistic regression models were trained on all combinations of birth weight, gestational age, and VSS. The area under the precision-recall curve was used to identify the highest-performing model.\nThe gestational age + VSS model had the highest performance (mean \u00b1 SD area under the precision-recall curve: 0.35 \u00b1 0.11). On 2 different test data sets (n = 444 and n = 132), sensitivity was 100% (positive predictive value: 28.1% and 22.6%) and specificity was 48.9% and 80.8% (negative predictive value: 100.0%).\nUsing a single examination, this model identified all infants who developed TR-ROP, on average, >1 month before diagnosis with moderate to high specificity. This approach could lead to earlier identification of incident severe ROP, reducing late diagnosis and treatment while simultaneously reducing the number of ROP examinations and unnecessary physiologic stress for low-risk infants.", "We aimed to develop an artificial intelligence (AI)-based deep learning algorithm (DLA) applying attribution methods without image segmentation to corneal confocal microscopy images and to accurately classify peripheral neuropathy (or lack of).\nThe AI-based DLA utilised convolutional neural networks with data augmentation to increase the algorithm's generalisability. The algorithm was trained using a high-end graphics processor for 300 epochs on 329 corneal nerve images and tested on 40 images (1 image/participant). Participants consisted of healthy volunteer (HV) participants (n\u2009=\u200990) and participants with type 1 diabetes (n\u2009=\u200988), type 2 diabetes (n\u2009=\u2009141) and prediabetes (n\u2009=\u200950) (defined as impaired fasting glucose, impaired glucose tolerance or a combination of both), and were classified into HV, those without neuropathy (PN-) (n\u2009=\u2009149) and those with neuropathy (PN+) (n\u2009=\u2009130). For the AI-based DLA, a modified residual neural network called ResNet-50 was developed and used to extract features from images and perform classification. The algorithm was tested on 40 participants (15\u00a0HV, 13 PN-, 12 PN+). Attribution methods gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM), Guided Grad-CAM and occlusion sensitivity displayed the areas within the image that had the greatest impact on the decision of the algorithm.\nThe results were as follows: HV: recall of 1.0 (95% CI 1.0, 1.0), precision of 0.83 (95% CI 0.65, 1.0), F1-score of 0.91 (95% CI 0.79, 1.0); PN-: recall of 0.85 (95% CI 0.62, 1.0), precision of 0.92 (95% CI 0.73, 1.0), F1-score of 0.88 (95% CI 0.71, 1.0); PN+: recall of 0.83 (95% CI 0.58, 1.0), precision of 1.0 (95% CI 1.0, 1.0), F1-score of 0.91 (95% CI 0.74, 1.0). The features displayed by the attribution methods demonstrated more corneal nerves in HV, a reduction in corneal nerves for PN- and an absence of corneal nerves for PN+ images.\nWe demonstrate promising results in the rapid classification of peripheral neuropathy using a single corneal image. A large-scale multicentre validation study is required to assess the utility of AI-based DLA in screening and diagnostic programmes for diabetic neuropathy.", "Although making music is a popular leisure activity for children and adolescents, few stay musically engaged. Previous research has focused on finding reasons for quitting musical activities, pedagogical strategies to keep students engaged with music, and motivational factors of musical training. Nonetheless, we know very little about how the proportion of musically active children changes with age and what traits influence the survival of musical engagement. This study used longitudinal data from secondary school students in the UK and Germany aged between 10 and 17 years. A survival analysis was applied to investigate the trajectories of musical activities across this age span. Other factors like type of learned instrument, gender, personality and intelligence were taken into account for further analyses using generalized linear models. Results indicate that about 50% of all students drop out of music lessons and other musical activities by the time they turn 17 years old, with most students quitting between the ages of 15 and 17. Musical home environment is an important factor that is associated with lower drop out rates while conscientiousness and theory of musicality showed smaller significant associations.", "Ceylon cinnamon, which was regarded as a luxury spice during ancient times, has been consumed for its medicinal properties and health benefits for thousands of years. For centuries, Arabian traders controlled the European cinnamon trade through limited supplies from a country which they did not reveal. Content marketing analysis and chemical profiling of value-added products of Ceylon cinnamon in the global marketplace are proposed to investigate the clean status of the product labels. In the present study, a mixed-method approach was employed to investigate the labels of 6 types of value-added forms of cinnamon; i.e. quills, powder, tea, breakfast cereals, confectionery and bakery and nutraceuticals which are used in USA, UK, Mexico, Japan and products of Sri Lankan cinnamon exporters. Two hundred and seventy-six labels were analyzed to find out the aspects of clean status, transparency and authenticity. Key label claims of the cinnamon products lie within the bounds of cleaner, healthy, nutritional and sustainable attributes. Consumer perception lies within ingredients, nutritional value, country of origin and claim on safety and quality standards and certification. The value chain transparency, ethical rules (species mislabeling), and chemical profile of the pharmaceutical, confectionery and fragrance industry inputs were ignored. The best claim and competitive advantage of the Ceylon cinnamon; an ultra-low level (<0.01 mg/g Dry Weight) of Coumarin, were rarely indicated in labels. Lack of clean labels and traceability lagged Ceylon cinnamon in the 40 international markets while Cassia cinnamon (Coumarin content 2.23 mg/g DW), a major competitor of Ceylon cinnamon appears in the market with dirty labels. Millennials and upper-middle-class female consumers in their active ages, place a high demand on Ceylon cinnamon. Today's tech-savvy global consumers of Ceylon cinnamon use market intelligence frequently for identifying product authenticity. Well equipped clean labels were found to be demanded by the modern cinnamon consumers.", "The purpose of this study was to identify a relationship between the background environment, bystander and emergency medical services intervention, and favourable neurological outcomes (CPC1-2) one-month after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) occurred at Tokyo train and subway stations.\nThis retrospective observational study used OHCA data between 2014 and 2018 that occurred at train stations in Tokyo. The eligible 954 patients were analysed for correlation between background, time frame, and location. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to estimate factors associated with CPC1-2 in patients with cardiogenic OHCA.\nA total of 886 OHCA cases, cardiogenic (n=562) and non-cardiogenic (n=324), met the inclusion criteria. Of the cardiogenic cases, 71.9% occurred at the platform and on-a-train. One-month CPC1-2 was achieved in 32.0% of cardiogenic OHCAs, which included 47.3% during morning rush hour, 24.7% during daytime hours, 40.2% during evening rush hour, and 20.5% during night-time/early morning hours. CPC1-2 had significant correlation with morning rush hour (adjusted odds ratio [AOR],4.52; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.09-18.78), evening rush hour (AOR, 6.85; 95% CI, 1.51-31.15), public access defibrillation (AOR, 5.19; 95% CI, 1.38-19.51), and ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia (AOR, 7.56; 95% CI, 1.35-42.43).\nA total of 71.9% of cardiogenic OHCAs occurred at platforms and on trains. To improve neurological outcomes of OHCAs at stations, AED installations on train platforms are necessary. Additionally, using artificial intelligence-based platform monitoring for early detection of OHCAs and offering CPR training are required.", "Leukemia is fatal cancer in both children and adults and is divided into acute and chronic. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a subtype of this cancer. Early diagnosis of this disease can have a significant impact on the treatment of this disease. Computational intelligence-oriented techniques can be used to help physicians identify and classify ALL rapidly. Materials and Method. In this study, the utilized dataset was collected from a CodaLab competition to classify leukemic cells from normal cells in microscopic images. Two famous deep learning networks, including residual neural network (ResNet-50) and VGG-16 were employed. These two networks are already trained by our assigned parameters, meaning we did not use the stored weights; we adjusted the weights and learning parameters too. Also, a convolutional network with ten convolutional layers and 2\u22172 max-pooling layers-with strides 2-was proposed, and six common machine learning techniques were developed to classify acute lymphoblastic leukemia into two classes.\nThe validation accuracies (the mean accuracy of training and test networks for 100 training cycles) of the ResNet-50, VGG-16, and the proposed convolutional network were found to be 81.63%, 84.62%, and 82.10%, respectively. Among applied machine learning methods, the lowest obtained accuracy was related to multilayer perceptron (27.33%) and highest for random forest (81.72%).\nThis study showed that the proposed convolutional neural network has optimal accuracy in the diagnosis of ALL. By comparing various convolutional neural networks and machine learning methods in diagnosing this disease, the convolutional neural network achieved good performance and optimal execution time without latency. This proposed network is less complex than the two pretrained networks and can be employed by pathologists and physicians in clinical systems for leukemia diagnosis.", "Population and public health are in the midst of an artificial intelligence revolution capable of radically altering existing models of care delivery and practice. Just as AI seeks to mirror human cognition through its data-driven analytics, it can also reflect the biases present in our collective conscience. In this Viewpoint, we use past and counterfactual examples to illustrate the sequelae of unmitigated bias in healthcare artificial intelligence. Past examples indicate that if the benefits of emerging AI technologies are to be realized, consensus around the regulation of algorithmic bias at the policy level is needed to ensure their ethical integration into the health system. This paper puts forth regulatory strategies for uprooting bias in healthcare AI that can inform ongoing efforts to establish a framework for federal oversight. We highlight three overarching oversight principles in bias mitigation that maps to each phase of the algorithm life cycle.", "Choosing optimal anti-seizure medication (ASM) is very important in pediatric patients with epilepsy who attend school, especially children with an intellectual disability (ID). Levetiracetam (LEV) has proven to be an effective, safe, generally well-tolerated, broad-spectrum ASM in children. In the context of increasing use of LEV in school-aged children with epilepsy and ID, we evaluate relevant clinical data, including efficacy, safety, and tolerability in children with epilepsy and an intellectual disability (ID) or normal intelligence (NI). We performed a retrospective chart review of children and included 298 pediatric patients with epilepsy who were treated with LEV with NI (147) and ID (151). After 6 months, 96% of NI and 83% of ID subjects had a seizure reduction rate greater than 50% (p = 0.031). The tolerability of LEV was generally good, with 75% retention rates at 2 years in both groups and only minor side effects (under 15%). The retention rates of patients with NI and ID were 76% and 74%, respectively (p = 0.597). Thus, LEV showed considerable efficacy with minimal side effects and high retention rates and is an easily maintained and safe treatment option for pediatric epilepsy with ID. However, better-designed research studies are needed to clearly elucidate the efficacy and safety of LEV in children with epilepsy and ID.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) has been widely used throughout medical imaging, including PET, for data correction, image reconstruction, and image processing tasks. However, there are number of opportunities for the application of AI in photon detector performance or the data collection process, such as to improve detector spatial resolution, time-of-flight information, or other PET system performance characteristics. This review outlines current topics, research highlights, and future directions of AI in PET instrumentation.", "Microbes embedded in hydrogels comprise one form of living material. Discovering formulations that balance potentially competing for mechanical and biological properties in living hydrogels-for example, gel time of the hydrogel formulation and viability of the embedded organisms-can be challenging. In this study, a pipeline is developed to automate the characterization of the gel time of hydrogel formulations. Using this pipeline, living materials comprised of enzymatically crosslinked silk and embedded E. coli-formulated from within a 4D parameter space-are engineered to gel within a pre-selected timeframe. Gelation time is estimated using a novel adaptation of microrheology analysis using differential dynamic microscopy (DDM). In order to expedite the discovery of gelation regime boundaries, Bayesian machine learning models are deployed with optimal decision-making under uncertainty. The rate of learning is observed to vary between artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted planning and human planning, with the fastest rate occurring during AI-assisted planning following a round of human planning. For a subset of formulations gelling within a targeted timeframe of 5-15 min, fluorophore production within the embedded cells is substantially similar across treatments, evidencing that gel time can be tuned independent of other material properties-at least over a finite range-while maintaining biological activity.", "Different studies have suggested that fluoride is related to neurological disorders in children and adolescents, but clinical evidences of which neurological parameters associated to fluoride exposure are, in fact, still controversial. In this way, this systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to show if there is an association between fluoride exposure from different sources, doses and neurological disorders. Terms related to \"Humans\"; \"Central nervous system\"; \"Fluorides\"; and \"Neurologic manifestations\" were searched in a systematic way on PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Lilacs, Cochrane and Google Scholar. All studies performed on humans exposed to fluoride were included on the final assessment. A meta-analysis was then performed and the quality level of evidence was performed using the GRADE approach. Our search retrieved 4,024 studies, among which 27 fulfilled the eligibility criteria. The main source of fluoride was naturally fluoridated water. Twenty-six studies showed alterations related to Intelligence Quotient (IQ) while only one has evaluated headache, insomnia, lethargy, polydipsia and polyuria. Ten studies were included on the meta-analysis, which showed IQ impairment only for individuals under high fluoride exposure considering the World Health Organization criteria, without evidences of association between low levels and any neurological disorder. However, the high heterogeneity observed compromise the final conclusions obtained by the quantitative analyses regarding such high levels. Furthermore, this association was classified as very low-level evidence. At this time, the current evidence does not allow us to state that fluoride is associated with neurological damage, indicating the need for new epidemiological studies that could provide further evidences regarding this possible association.", "Delineation of clinical target volume (CTV) for radiotherapy is a time-consuming and labor-intensive work. This study aims to propose a novel convolutional neural network (CNN)-based model for fast auto-segmentation of CTV. To evaluate its performance and clinical utility, a blind randomized validation method was used.\nOur proposed model was based on the generally accepted U-Net architecture using computed tomography slices with CTV contours delineated by experienced radiation clinicians from 135 rectal patients receiving neoadjuvant radiotherapy. The Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and 95th percentile Hausdorff distance (95HD) were used to measure segmentation performance. The validated dataset of additional 20 patients for clinical evaluation by 10 experienced oncology clinicians from 7 centers was randomly and blindly divided into two groups for clinicians' scoring and Turing test, respectively. Second evaluation was performed with different randomization after 2\u00a0weeks.\nThe mean DSC and 95HD values of the proposed model were 0.90\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.02 and 8.11\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.93\u00a0mm for CTV of rectal cancer patients, respectively. The average time for automatic segmentation in the validation groups was 15\u00a0s per patient. By clinicians' scoring, the AI model performed better than manually delineating, though the differences were not significant (Week 0: 2.59 vs. 2.52, p\u00a0=\u00a00.086; Week 2: 2.55 vs. 2.47, p\u00a0=\u00a00.115). Additionally, the mean positive rates in the Turing test were 40.5% in Week 0 and 45.2% in Week 2, which demonstrated the great intelligence of our model.\nOur proposed model can be used clinically for assisting contouring of CTVs in rectal cancer patients receiving neoadjuvant radiotherapy, which improves the efficiency and consistency of radiation clinicians' work.", "The ability of a computer to perform tasks normally requiring human intelligence or artificial intelligence (AI) is not new. However, until recently, practical applications in medical imaging were limited, especially in the clinic. With advances in theory, microelectronic circuits, and computer architecture as well as our ability to acquire and access large amounts of data, AI is becoming increasingly ubiquitous in medical imaging. Of particular interest to our community, radiomics tries to identify imaging features of specific pathology that can represent, for example, the texture or shape of a region in the image. This is conducted based on a review of mathematical patterns and pattern combinations. The difficulty is often finding sufficient data to span the spectrum of disease heterogeneity because many features change with pathology as well as over time and, among other issues, data acquisition is expensive. Although we are currently in the early days of the practical application of AI to medical imaging, research is ongoing to integrate imaging, molecular pathobiology, genetic make-up, and clinical manifestations to classify patients into subgroups for the purpose of precision medicine, or in other words, predicting a priori treatment response and outcome. Lung cancer is a functionally and morphologically heterogeneous disease. Positron emission tomography (PET) is an imaging technique with an important role in the precision medicine of patients with lung cancer that helps predict early response to therapy and guides the selection of appropriate treatment. Although still in its infancy, early results suggest that the use of AI in PET of lung cancer has promise for the detection, segmentation, and characterization of disease as well as for outcome prediction.", "Almost 1 in 10 individuals can suffer from one of many rare diseases (RDs). The average time to diagnosis for an RD patient is as high as 7 years. Artificial intelligence (AI)-based positron emission tomography (PET), if implemented appropriately, has tremendous potential to advance the diagnosis of RDs. Patient advocacy groups must be active stakeholders in the AI ecosystem if we are to avoid potential issues related to the implementation of AI into health care. AI medical devices must not only be RD-aware at each stage of their conceptualization and life cycle but also should be trained on diverse and augmented datasets representative of the end-user population including RDs. Inability to do so leads to potential harm and unsustainable deployment of AI-based medical devices (AIMDs) into clinical practice.", "Lung cancer is one of the most common tumors. There are 1.8 million new cases worldwide each year, accounting for about 13% of all new tumors. Lung cancer is the most important cause of cancer-related deaths. 1.4 million people die of lung cancer each year. This article uses artificial intelligence technology to analyze the pathology of hesperetin-derived small cell lung cancer under fiberoptic bronchoscopy. This article takes 48 lung slice samples as the research object. Among them, 36 cases of lung small cell carcinoma have history slices from Lhasa City Institute of Biology, the patient has complete cases, and the other 12 normal lung slices come from Xinjiang Biotechnology Laboratory. In this paper, the above-mentioned 36 lung cancer slices became the study group, and 12 normal slices became the reference group. This article presents a method for hesperetin-fiber bronchoscope to study the pathological mechanism of lung small cell carcinoma (H-FBS), which is used to study slices. The above-mentioned 48 samples were taken for slice observation. First, the 48 slices were technically tested by artificial intelligence fiber bronchoscope combined with hesperetin derivatives, and then the slice observation results were verified by CTC technology. In addition, in each step, the C5orf34 in the tissue is detected separately, which is beneficial to adjust the content of C5orf34 so that the treatment of lung cancer can control the development of lung cancer under fiberoptic bronchoscopy. Experimental results show that the diagnostic accuracy rate of this method is 97.9%, which is higher than that of lung biopsy (89%); compared with multiple CTC detection, the cost is low and the time is shor.", "Malignant lymphomas are a family of heterogenous disorders caused by clonal proliferation of lymphocytes. 18F-FDG-PET has proven to provide essential information for accurate quantification of disease burden, treatment response evaluation, and prognostication. However, manual delineation of hypermetabolic lesions is often a time-consuming and impractical task. Applications of artificial intelligence (AI) may provide solutions to overcome this challenge. Beyond segmentation and detection of lesions, AI could enhance tumor characterization and heterogeneity quantification, as well as treatment response prediction and recurrence risk stratification. In this scoping review, we have systematically mapped and discussed the current applications of AI (such as detection, classification, segmentation as well as the prediction and prognostication) in lymphoma PET.", "The abundance of glycomics data that have accumulated has led to the development of many useful databases to aid in the understanding of the function of the glycans and their impact on cellular activity. At the same time, the endeavor for data sharing between glycomics databases with other biological databases have contributed to the creation of new knowledgebases. However, different data types in data description have impeded the data sharing for knowledge integration. To solve this matter, Semantic Web techniques including Resource Description Framework (RDF) and ontology development have been adopted by various groups to standardize the format for data exchange. These semantic data have contributed to the expansion of knowledgebases and hold promises of providing data that can be intelligently processed. On the other hand, bench biologists who are experts in experimental finding are end users and data producers. Therefore, it is indispensable to reduce the technical barrier required for bench biologists to manipulate their experimental data to be compatible with standard formats for data sharing.\nThere are many essential concepts and practical techniques for data integration but there is no method to enable researchers to easily apply Semantic Web techniques to their experimental data. We implemented our procedure on unformatted information of E.coli O-antigen structures collected from the web and show how this information can be expressed as formatted data applicable to Semantic Web standards. In particular, we described the E-coli O-antigen biosynthesis pathway using the BioPAX ontology developed to support data exchange between pathway databases.\nThe method we implemented to semantically describe O-antigen biosynthesis should be helpful for biologists to understand how glycan information, including relevant pathway reaction data, can be easily shared. We hope this method can contribute to lower the technical barrier that is required when experimental findings are formulated into formal representations and can lead bench scientists to readily participate in the construction of new knowledgebases that are integrated with existing ones. Such integration over the Semantic Web will enable future work in artificial intelligence and machine learning to enable computers to infer new relationships and hypotheses in the life sciences.", "Artificial intelligence is increasingly utilized to aid in the interpretation of cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) studies. One of the first steps is the identification of the imaging plane depicted, which can be achieved by both deep learning (DL) and classical machine learning (ML) techniques without user input. We aimed to compare the accuracy of ML and DL for CMR view classification and to identify potential pitfalls during training and testing of the algorithms.\nTo train our DL and ML algorithms, we first established datasets by retrospectively selecting 200 CMR cases. The models were trained using two different cohorts (passively and actively curated) and applied data augmentation to enhance training. Once trained, the models were validated on an external dataset, consisting of 20 cases acquired at another center. We then compared accuracy metrics and applied class activation mapping (CAM) to visualize DL model performance.\nThe DL and ML models trained with the passively-curated CMR cohort were 99.1% and 99.3% accurate on the validation set, respectively. However, when tested on the CMR cases with complex anatomy, both models performed poorly. After training and testing our models again on all 200 cases (active cohort), validation on the external dataset resulted in 95% and 90% accuracy, respectively. The CAM analysis depicted heat maps that demonstrated the importance of carefully curating the datasets to be used for training.\nBoth DL and ML models can accurately classify CMR images, but DL outperformed ML when classifying images with complex heart anatomy.", "Hydrogels are prevalent scaffolds for tissue regeneration because of their hierarchical architectures along with outstanding biocompatibility and unique rheological and mechanical properties. For decades, researchers have found that many materials (natural, synthetic, or hybrid) can form hydrogels using different cross-linking strategies. Traditional strategies for fabricating hydrogels include physical, chemical, and enzymatical cross-linking methods. However, due to the diverse characteristics of different tissues/organs to be regenerated, tissue-customized hydrogels need to be developed through precisely controlled processes, making the manufacture of hydrogels reliant on novel cross-linking strategies. Thus, hybrid cross-linkable materials are proposed to tackle this challenge through hybrid cross-linking strategies. Here, different cross-linkable materials and their associated cross-linking strategies are summarized. From the perspective of the major characteristics of the target tissues/organs, we critically analyze how different cross-linking strategies are tailored to fit the regeneration of such tissues and organs. To further advance this field, more appropriate cross-linkable materials and cross-linking strategies should be investigated. In addition, some innovative technologies, such as 3D bioprinting, the internet of medical things (IoMT), and artificial intelligence (AI), are also proposed to improve the development of hydrogels for more efficient tissue regeneration.", "Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques have been implemented in the field of Medical Imaging for more than forty years. Medical Physicists, Clinicians and Computer Scientists have been collaborating since the beginning to realize software solutions to enhance the informative content of medical images, including AI-based support systems for image interpretation. Despite the recent massive progress in this field due to the current emphasis on Radiomics, Machine Learning and Deep Learning, there are still some barriers to overcome before these tools are fully integrated into the clinical workflows to finally enable a precision medicine approach to patients' care. Nowadays, as Medical Imaging has entered the Big Data era, innovative solutions to efficiently deal with huge amounts of data and to exploit large and distributed computing resources are urgently needed. In the framework of a collaboration agreement between the Italian Association of Medical Physicists (AIFM) and the National Institute for Nuclear Physics (INFN), we propose a model of an intensive computing infrastructure, especially suited for training AI models, equipped with secure storage systems, compliant with data protection regulation, which will accelerate the development and extensive validation of AI-based solutions in the Medical Imaging field of research. This solution can be developed and made operational by Physicists and Computer Scientists working on complementary fields of research in Physics, such as High Energy Physics and Medical Physics, who have all the necessary skills to tailor the AI-technology to the needs of the Medical Imaging community and to shorten the pathway towards the clinical applicability of AI-based decision support systems.", "Artificial intelligence is an important technology, with rapidly expanding applications for cardiac PET. We review the common terminology, including methods for training and testing, which are fundamental to understanding artificial intelligence. Next, we highlight applications to improve image acquisition, reconstruction, and segmentation. Computed tomographic imaging is commonly acquired in conjunction with PET and various artificial intelligence methods have been applied, including methods to automatically extract anatomic information or generate synthetic attenuation images. Last, we describe methods to automate disease diagnosis or risk stratification. This summary highlights the current and future clinical applications of artificial intelligence to cardiovascular PET imaging.", "Conventional statistics are based on a simple cause-and-effect principle. Postoperative complications, however, have a multifactorial and interrelated etiology. The application of artificial intelligence might be more accurate to predict postoperative outcomes. The objective of this study was to determine the current quality of studies describing the use of artificial intelligence in predicting complications in patients undergoing major abdominal surgery.\nA literature search was performed in PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science. Inclusion criteria were (1) empirical studies including patients undergoing (2) any type of gastrointestinal surgery, including hepatopancreaticobiliary surgery, whose (3) complications or mortality were predicted with the use of (4) any artificial intelligence system. Studies were screened for description of method of validation and testing in methodology. Outcome measurements were sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve.\nFrom a total of 1,537 identified articles, 15 were included for the review. Among a large variety of algorithms used by the included studies, sensitivity was between 0.06 and 0.96, specificity was between 0.61 and 0.98, accuracy was between 0.78 and 0.95, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve varied between 0.50 and 0.96.\nArtificial intelligence algorithms have the ability to accurately predict postoperative complications. Nevertheless, algorithms should be properly tested and validated, both internally and externally. Furthermore, a complete database and the absence of unsampled imbalanced data are absolute prerequisites for algorithms to predict accurately.", "PET imaging with targeted novel tracers has been commonly used in the clinical management of prostate cancer. The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in PET imaging is a relatively new approach and in this review article, we will review the current trends and categorize the currently available research into the quantification of tumor burden within the organ, evaluation of metastatic disease, and translational/supplemental research which aims to improve other AI research efforts.", "Recently, because of the unique properties of anisotropic and isotropic structures, there are more research studies on anisotropic hydrogels. We prepared a gradient anisotropic carboxymethyl cellulose hydrogel (CMC-Al3+) by directionally diffusing aluminum chloride solution. The orientation of carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) chains is perpendicular to the direction of aluminum ion diffusion. The degree of cross-linking and orientation gradually decrease along the direction of aluminum ion diffusion. Compared with anisotropic hydrogels prepared by other methods, the hydrogels prepared by directionally diffusing aluminum ion solution have a gradient lamellar structure. Because of the large amount of aluminum ions in CMC-Al3+, the hydrogel shows good sensing performance. CMC-Al3+ is packaged with PVC electrical flame retardant tape to produce a strain sensor used to detect human tiny movements, which can accurately and stably monitor tiny movements. Hydrogel-based strain sensors can be widely used in the fields of human-computer intelligence, human-computer interaction, and wearable devices in the future.", "At present, the traditional geographical study is somewhat shifted to virtual web-datacentric geographical study and it was started almost around last decade of the twentieth century concerning remotely sensed earth surface, digitisation, virtual data storing and their artificial intelligence based machine learning for spatio-temporal analysis, prediction and thematic mapping. Now in the age of webdom-a global digital kingdom of internet and web services, when internet services flooded everything relating to continuous up-gradation of computer-related science and technologies along with increasing number of internet users and GPS enabled smart phones, geographical data are generated by exaflood leading to bigdata. Many online data are now easily available to everyone from anywhere at any time. The objective is to assess the webdom and to understand the scope of contemporary virtual web-data-centric geographical study involving geographical bigdata, machine learning and WebGIS, when virtual world abundantly expands gradually during this period of webdom. Each data in bigdata contains geospatial attributes. Worldwide under the exponential growth and advancement of data science like other scientific disciplines geography is also predicting different phenomenon based on artificial intelligence and machine learning. The three main facets of virtual web-data-centric geographical study are geographical bigdata, geographical machine learning, and WebGIS. It is centrally concerned with digital data and web services. Here data are analysed through machine learning methods. Sometimes reliability of web-data is in question without field verification which is considered as the primary requisition of traditional geography.", "The early stage of a keratoconus (KC), without classic and characteristic clinical findings, is a contraindication for refractive surgery. This article therefore shows, in accordance with the current state of the art, ways of identifying risk factors for subclinical keratoconus.After delimitation, this publication contains a current summary of epidemiology, etiology and pathophysiology of subclinical and clinical KC. Furthermore, an overview of different grading scales is given. A detailed description of several practical possibilities for detection of subclinical KC is the focus of this publication: typical abnormalities with subclinical KC in ocular aberrometry, corneal topography, Zernike analysis, Fourier analysis, indices of the corneal anterior surface; especially tomography of the anterior segment of the eye respecting addition of the corneal posterior surface and the pachymetry, and also innovative techniques counting in the rigidity or biomechanical properties, as well as traditional techniques giving hints for subclinical KC as retinoscopy, ophthalmoscopy and subjective refraction.In preparation for refractive surgical interventions and to avoid possible consequences of subclinical KC, a suitable analysis with different methods should always be carried out in addition to a specific anamnesis. An exclusive consideration of the available indices is not sufficient, as this does not reveal early stages. Ideally, the biomechanics of the cornea is included in the diagnosis. The combination of tomography and biomechanics with methods of artificial intelligence are trendsetting in detection of subclinical KC.", "Diagnostic uncertainty, commonly encountered in rheumatology and other fields of medicine, is an opportunity: Stakeholders who understand uncertainty's causes and quantitate its effects can reduce uncertainty and can use uncertainty to improve medical practice, science, and administration. To articulate, bring attention to, and offer recommendations for diagnostic uncertainty, the Barbara Volcker Center at the Hospital for Special Surgery sponsored, in April 2021, a virtual international workshop, \"When a Diagnosis Has No Name.\" This paper summarizes the opinions of 72 stakeholders from the fields of medical research, industry, federal regulatory agencies, insurers, hospital management, medical philosophy, public media, health care law, clinical rheumatology, other specialty areas of medicine, and patients. Speakers addressed the effects of diagnostic uncertainty in their fields. The workshop addressed the following six questions: What is a diagnosis? What are the purposes of diagnoses? How do doctors assign diagnoses? What is uncertainty? What are its causes? How does understanding uncertainty offer opportunities to improve all fields of medicine? The workshop's conveners systematically reviewed video recordings of formal presentations, video recordings of open discussion periods, manuscripts, and slide files submitted by the speakers to develop consensus take-home messages, which were as follows: Diagnostic uncertainty causes harm when patients lack access to laboratory test and treatments, do not participate in research studies, are not counted in administrative and public health documents, and suffer humiliation in their interactions with others. Uncertainty offers opportunities, such as quantifying uncertainty, using statistical technologies and automated intelligence to stratify patient groups by level of uncertainty, using a common vocabulary, and considering the effects of time.", "Applications of \"artificial intelligence\" (AI) have been exponentially expanding in health care. Readily accessible archives of enormous digital data in medical imaging have made radiology a leader in exploring and taking advantage of this technology. AI-assisted radiology has paved the way toward another level of precision in medicine. In this article, the authors aim to review current AI applications in PET imaging of head and neck cancers, beginning with radiomics and followed by deep learning in each section.", "This review discusses the current state of artificial intelligence (AI) in 18F-NaF-PET/CT imaging and the potential applications to come in diagnosis, prognostication, and improvement of care in patients with bone diseases, with emphasis on the role of AI algorithms in CT bone segmentation, relying on their prevalence in medical imaging and utility in the extraction of spatial information in combined PET/CT studies.", "The development of medical imaging artificial intelligence (AI) systems for evaluating COVID-19 patients has demonstrated potential for improving clinical decision making and assessing patient outcomes during the recent COVID-19 pandemic. These have been applied to many medical imaging tasks, including disease diagnosis and patient prognosis, as well as augmented other clinical measurements to better inform treatment decisions. Because these systems are used in life-or-death decisions, clinical implementation relies on user trust in the AI output. This has caused many developers to utilize explainability techniques in an attempt to help a user understand when an AI algorithm is likely to succeed as well as which cases may be problematic for automatic assessment, thus increasing the potential for rapid clinical translation. AI application to COVID-19 has been marred with controversy recently.

However, ongoing advances in hardware and software as well as increasing access to ever-expanding datasets for training, validation, and testing purposes are likely to make AI an increasingly prevalent and powerful tool. Of course issues, such as the need to protect the privacy of sensitive health data, remain; nevertheless, it is likely the average imager will need to develop an evidence-based approach to assessing AI in medical imaging. We hope this article will provide insight into just how this can be conducted by applying 5 simple questions, specifically: (1) Who was in the training sample, (2) How was the model trained, (3) How reliable is the algorithm, (4) How was the model validated, and (5) How useable is the algorithm.", "As medicine enters the era of artificial intelligence (AI)-augmented practice, dermatology is beginning to witness the integration of AI into the daily practice, particularly in the areas of diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of skin diseases.

All participants underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and functional MRI (fMRI) to acquire data on brain structure and function, including gray matter volume (GMV), fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (fALFF), regional homogeneity (ReHo), functional connectivity (FC), and brain network properties. The cognitive ability was evaluated with the California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT), intelligence quotient (IQ), and short delay free recall (SDFR).\nCompared to LA, GMV significantly decreased in the brain regions in VN, SMN, and VAN in the alcohol-drinking groups (BD, LD, LDD, and HD). ReHo was significantly enhanced in the brain regions in VN, SMN, and VAN, while fALFF significantly increased in the brain regions in VN and SMN. The number of intra- and inter-modular connections within networks (VN, SMN, sensory control network [SCN], and VAN) and their connections to other modules were abnormally changed. These changes adversely affected cognition (e.g., IQ, CVLT, SDFR).\nDespite the small sample size, this study provides new evidence supporting the need for young people to abstain from alcohol to protect their brains. These findings present strong reasoning for updating anti-alcohol slogans and guidelines for young people in the future.", "Rapid progress of industrial development, urbanization and traffic has caused air quality reduction that negatively affects human health and environmental sustainability, especially among developed countries. Numerous studies on the development of air quality forecasting model using machine learning have been conducted to control air pollution. As such, there are significant numbers of reviews on the application of machine learning in air quality forecasting. Shallow architectures of machine learning exhibit several limitations and yield lower forecasting accuracy than deep learning architecture. Deep learning is a new technology in computational intelligence; thus, its application in air quality forecasting is still limited. This study aims to investigate the deep learning applications in time series air quality forecasting. Owing to this, literature search is conducted thoroughly from all scientific databases to avoid unnecessary clutter. This study summarizes and discusses different types of deep learning algorithms applied in air quality forecasting, including the theoretical backgrounds, hyperparameters, applications and limitations. Hybrid deep learning with data decomposition, optimization algorithm and spatiotemporal models are also presented to highlight those techniques' effectiveness in tackling the drawbacks of individual deep learning models. It is clearly stated that hybrid deep learning was able to forecast future air quality with higher accuracy than individual models. At the end of the study, some possible research directions are suggested for future model development. The main objective of this review study is to provide a comprehensive literature summary of deep learning applications in time series air quality forecasting that may benefit interested researchers for subsequent research.", "The recent developments in artificial intelligence have the potential to facilitate new research methods in ecology. Especially Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) have been shown to outperform other approaches in automatic image analyses. Here we apply a DCNN to facilitate quantitative wood anatomical (QWA) analyses, where the main challenges reside in the detection of a high number of cells, in the intrinsic variability of wood anatomical features, and in the sample quality. To properly classify and interpret features within the images, DCNNs need to undergo a training stage. We performed the training with images from transversal wood anatomical sections, together with manually created optimal outputs of the target cell areas. The target species included an example for the most common wood anatomical structures: four conifer species; a diffuse-porous species, black alder (Alnus glutinosa L.); a diffuse to semi-diffuse-porous species, European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.); and a ring-porous species, sessile oak (Quercus petraea Liebl.). The DCNN was created in Python with Pytorch, and relies on a Mask-RCNN architecture. The developed algorithm detects and segments cells, and provides information on the measurement accuracy. To evaluate the performance of this tool we compared our Mask-RCNN outputs with U-Net, a model architecture employed in a similar study, and with ROXAS, a program based on traditional image analysis techniques. First, we evaluated how many target cells were correctly recognized. Next, we assessed the cell measurement accuracy by evaluating the number of pixels that were correctly assigned to each target cell. Overall, the \"learning process\" defining artificial intelligence plays a key role in overcoming the issues that are usually manually solved in QWA analyses. Mask-RCNN is the model that better detects which are the features characterizing a target cell when these issues occur. In general, U-Net did not attain the other algorithms' performance, while ROXAS performed best for conifers, and Mask-RCNN showed the highest accuracy in detecting target cells and segmenting lumen areas of angiosperms. Our research demonstrates that future software tools for QWA analyses would greatly benefit from using DCNNs, saving time during the analysis phase, and providing a flexible approach that allows model retraining.", "Regulatory agencies encourage computer modeling and simulation to reduce the time and cost of clinical trials. Although still not classified in formal guidelines, system biology-based models represent a powerful tool for generating hypotheses with great molecular detail. Herein, we have applied a mechanistic head-to-head in silico clinical trial (ISCT) between two treatments for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, to wit lisdexamfetamine (LDX) and methylphenidate (MPH). The ISCT was generated through three phases comprising (i) the molecular characterization of drugs and pathologies, (ii) the generation of adult and children virtual populations (vPOPs) totaling 2,600 individuals and the creation of physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) and quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP) models, and (iii) data analysis with artificial intelligence methods. The characteristics of our vPOPs were in close agreement with real reference populations extracted from clinical trials, as did our PBPK models with in vivo parameters. The mechanisms of action of LDX and MPH were obtained from QSP models combining PBPK modeling of dosing schemes and systems biology-based modeling technology, i.e., therapeutic performance mapping system. The step-by-step process described here to undertake a head-to-head ISCT would allow obtaining mechanistic conclusions that could be extrapolated or used for predictions to a certain extent at the clinical level. Altogether, these computational techniques are proven an excellent tool for hypothesis-generation and would help reach a personalized medicine.", "With the recent advancement in analytic techniques and the increasing generation of healthcare data, artificial intelligence (AI) is reinventing the healthcare system for tackling pandemics securely in smart cities. AI tools continue register numerous successes in major disease areas such as cancer, neurology and now in new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) detection. COVID-19 patients often experience several symptoms which include breathlessness, fever, cough, nausea, sore throat, blocked nose, runny nose, headache, muscle aches, and joint pains. This paper proposes an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm that predicts the rate of likely survivals of COVID-19 suspected patients based on good immune system, exercises and age quantiles securely. Four algorithms (Na\u00efve Bayes, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree and k-Nearest Neighbours (kNN)) were compared. We performed True Positive (TP) rate and False Positive (FP) rate analysis on both positive and negative covid patients data. The experimental results show that kNN, and Decision Tree both obtained a score of 99.30% while Na\u00efve Bayes and Logistic Regression obtained 91.70% and 99.20%, respectively on TP rate for negative patients. For positive covid patients, Na\u00efve Bayes outperformed other models with a score of 10.90%. On the other hand, Na\u00efve Bayes obtained a score of 89.10% for FP rate for negative patients while Logistic Regression, kNN, and Decision Tree obtained scores of 93.90%, 93.90%, and 94.50%, respectively.", "To explore current research on the ethics of smart home technologies including artificial intelligence and information technologies for elderly care by conducting a scoping review.\nThe development of smart home technologies for care of the older adults provides potential solutions to reduce the caregiver burden within families where they are urgently needed. Building an ethical system to support the application of these technical products should be explored.\nThe literature search was performed in seven electronic databases. Relevant studies from January 2015 to February 2021 were selected; screening and analysis were completed independently by two researchers.\nThere were a total of 15 included studies on the ethics of smart home technologies for elderly care, which focused on the following issues: privacy (information privacy and physical privacy), autonomy (independence, informed consent and user-centred control), safety guarantee, fairness and concerns about reduced human contact.\nThere exist a number of ethical conflicts in the application of smart home technologies for elderly care. Therefore, it is necessary to further investigate the ethical issues with regards to the decision-making process of weighing the advantages and disadvantages of these technologies.\nEfforts should be made to establish a corresponding ethical framework to ensure the sustainable development of smart, home-based elderly care. Nurses may play an important role in the design and implementation of these technologies to promote ethical awareness and practice.", "Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a high-mortality disease and lacks effective pharmacotherapy. A traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) formula, Ning Fei Ping Xue (NFPX) decoction, was demonstrated to play a critical role in alleviating inflammatory responses of the lung. However, its therapeutic effectiveness in ARDS and active compounds, targets, and molecular mechanisms remain to be elucidated. The present study investigates the effects of NFPX decoction on ARDS mice induced by lipopolysaccharides (LPS). The results revealed that NFPX alleviated lung edema evaluated by lung ultrasound, decreased lung wet/Dry ratio, the total cell numbers of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), and IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1 levels in BALF and serum, and ameliorated lung pathology in a dose-dependent manner. Subsequently, UPLC-HRMS was performed to establish the compounds of NFPX. A total of 150 compounds in NFPX were characterized. Moreover, integrating network pharmacology approach and transcriptional profiling of lung tissues were performed to predict the underlying mechanism. 37 active components and 77 targets were screened out, and a herbs-compounds-targets network was constructed. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified from LPS-treated mice compared with LPS combined with NFPX mice. GO, KEGG, and artificial intelligence analysis indicated that NFPX might act on various drug targets. At last, potential targets, HRAS, SMAD4, and AMPK, were validated by qRT-PCR in ARDS murine model. In conclusion, we prove the efficacy of NFPX decoction in the treatment of ARDS. Furthermore, integrating network pharmacology, transcriptome, and artificial intelligence analysis contributes to illustrating the molecular mechanism of NFPX decoction on ARDS.", "The novel Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-2019) has become a global pandemic and affected almost all aspects of our daily life. The total number of positive COVID-2019 cases has exponentially increased in the last few months due to the easy transmissibility of the virus. It can be detected using the nucleic acid test or the antibodies blood test which are not always available and take several hours to get the results. Therefore, researchers proposed computer-aided diagnosis systems using the state-of-the-art artificial intelligence techniques to learn imaging biomarkers from chest computed tomography and X-ray radiographs to effectively diagnose COVID-19. However, previous methods either adopted transfer learning from a pre-trained model on natural images or were trained on limited datasets. Either cases may lead to accuracy deficiency or overfitting. In addition, feature space suffers from noise and outliers when collecting X-ray images from multiple datasets. In this paper, we overcome the previous limitations by firstly collecting a large-scale X-ray dataset from multiple resources. Our dataset includes 11,312 images collected from 10 different data repositories. To alleviate the effect of the noise, we suppress it in the feature space of our new dataset. Secondly, we introduce a supervision mechanism and combine it with the VGG-16 network to consider the differences between the COVID-19 and healthy cases in the feature space. Thirdly, we propose a multi-site (center) COVID-19 graph convolutional network (GCN) that exploits dataset information, the status of training samples, and initial scores to effectively classify the disease status. Extensive experiments using different convolutional neural network-based methods with and without the supervision mechanism and different classifiers are performed. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed supervision mechanism in all models and superior performance with the proposed GCN.", "The societal and ethical implications of artificial intelligence (AI) have sparked discussions among academics, policymakers and the public around the world. What has gone unnoticed so far are the likewise vibrant discussions in China. We analyzed a large sample of discussions about AI ethics on two Chinese social media platforms. Findings suggest that participants were diverse, and included scholars, IT industry actors, journalists, and members of the general public. They addressed a broad range of concerns associated with the application of AI in various fields. Some even gave recommendations on how to tackle these issues. We argue that these discussions are a valuable source for understanding the future trajectory of AI development in China as well as implications for global dialogue on AI governance.", "Regulating artificial intelligence (AI) has become necessary in light of its deployment in high-risk scenarios. This paper explores the proposal to extend legal personhood to AI and robots, which had not yet been examined through the lens of the general public. We present two studies (N = 3,559) to obtain people's views of electronic legal personhood vis-\u00e0-vis existing liability models. Our study reveals people's desire to punish automated agents even though these entities are not recognized any mental state. Furthermore, people did not believe automated agents' punishment would fulfill deterrence nor retribution and were unwilling to grant them legal punishment preconditions, namely physical independence and assets. Collectively, these findings suggest a conflict between the desire to punish automated agents and its perceived impracticability. We conclude by discussing how future design and legal decisions may influence how the public reacts to automated agents' wrongdoings.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, particularly deep learning, have developed to the point that they can be applied in image recognition tasks. The use of AI in medical imaging can guide radiologists to more accurate image interpretation and diagnosis in radiology. The software will provide data that we cannot extract from the images.

Among those are its widespread applications in head and neck cancer.", "To identify current patient and provider engagement methods that use technology in allergy and immunology clinics, in hospitals, and at home.\nApple App Store and Google searches for allergy and immunology technology applications and PubMed search of literature involving keywords of website, technology, electronic health record, medical devices, disparity in technology, coding for remote patient monitoring, and artificial intelligence.\nStudies that addressed the keywords were included and narrowed down based on their applicability in the allergy and immunology clinic.\nThere has been rapid innovation in the digital health care space with expansion of electronic medical record services and the patient portal, creation of allergy and immunology-specific medical devices and applications with remote patient monitoring capabilities, and website and artificial intelligence development to interact with patients.\nThese technological advances provide distinct advantages to the provider and patient but also have a burden of time for evaluation of the data for the provider and disparate access to certain technologies for patients. The development of these technologies has been fast-tracked since the start of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. With the explosion in telehealth and medical device development, advancement of medical technology is not revealing any signs of slowing down. It is paving a new way to interact with patients in the future.", "An appropriate threshold is a key to using the multi-threshold segmentation method to solve image segmentation problems, and the swarm intelligence (SI) optimization algorithm is one of the popular methods to obtain the optimal threshold. Moreover, Salp Swarm Algorithm (SSA) is a recently released swarm intelligent optimization algorithm. Compared with other SI optimization algorithms, the optimization solution strategy of the SSA still needs to be improved to enhance further the solution accuracy and optimization efficiency of the algorithm. Accordingly, this paper designs an effective segmentation method based on a non-local mean 2D histogram and 2D Kapur's entropy called SSA with Gaussian Barebone and Stochastic Fractal Search (GBSFSSSA) by combining Gaussian Barebone and Stochastic Fractal Search mechanism. In GBSFSSSA, the Gaussian Barebone and Stochastic Fractal Search mechanism effectively balance the global search ability and local search ability of the basic SSA. The CEC2017 competition data set is used to prove the algorithm's performance, and GBSFSSSA shows an absolute advantage over some typical competitive algorithms. Furthermore, the algorithm is applied in image segmentation of COVID-19 CT images, and the results are analyzed based on three different metrics: peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity (SSIM), and feature similarity (FSIM), which can lead to the conclusion that the overall performance of GBSFSSSA is better than the comparison algorithm and can effectively improve the segmentation of medical images. Therefore, it is justified that GBSFSSSA is a reliable and effective method in solving the multi-threshold image segmentation problem.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) is an emerging technology with great potential, and its robust calculation and analysis capabilities are unmatched by traditional calculation tools. With the promotion of deep learning and open-source platforms, the threshold of AI has also become lower. Combining artificial intelligence with traditional fields to create new fields of high research and application value has become a trend. AI has been involved in many disciplines, such as medicine, materials, energy, and economics. The development of AI requires the support of many kinds of data, and microfluidic systems can often mine object data on a large scale to support AI. Due to the excellent synergy between the two technologies, excellent research results have emerged in many fields. In this review, we briefly review AI and microfluidics and introduce some applications of their combination, mainly in nanomedicine and material synthesis. Finally, we discuss the development trend of the combination of the two technologies.", "Gastrointestinal endoscopy and biopsy-based pathological findings are needed to diagnose early gastric cancer. However, the information of biopsy specimen is limited because of the topical procedure; therefore, pathology doctors sometimes diagnose as gastric indefinite for dysplasia (GIN).\nWe compared the accuracy of physician-performed endoscopy (trainee, n\u00a0=\u00a03; specialists, n\u00a0=\u00a03), artificial intelligence (AI)-based endoscopy, and/or molecular markers (DNA methylation: BARHL2, MINT31, TET1, miR-148a, miR-124a-3, NKX6-1; mutations: TP53; and microsatellite instability) in diagnosing GIN lesions. We enrolled 24,388 patients who underwent endoscopy, and 71 patients were diagnosed with GIN lesions. Thirty-two cases of endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) in 71 GIN lesions and 32 endoscopically resected tissues were assessed by endoscopists, AI, and molecular markers to identify benign or malignant lesions.\nThe board-certified endoscopic physicians group showed the highest accuracy in the receiver operative characteristic curve (area under the curve [AUC]: 0.931), followed by a combination of AI and miR148a DNA methylation (AUC: 0.825), and finally trainee endoscopists (AUC: 0.588).\nAI with miR148s DNA methylation-based diagnosis is a potential modality for diagnosing GIN.", "A variety of therapeutic approaches are employed to treat patients suffering from breast cancer. Likewise, a broad spectrum of imaging ligands has been introduced for noninvasive positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) imaging to enable comprehensive tumor characterization and more accurate response evaluation.\nIn recent years, novel radioactively labeled ligands have been developed for PET/CT imaging in metastatic breast cancer. One promising tracer is [18F]fluoroestradiol, which was recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration. It can be used for a whole-body assessment of estrogen receptor status. Another radionuclide currently under development is [68Ga]Ga-fibroblast-activation-protein inhibitor. In addition to new radionuclides, the field of application for existing tracers like [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) was broadened. It has been shown that an early therapeutic response to various therapies can be detected by [18F]FDG PET/CT, which leads to early treatment optimization. Key Message: In this review, we highlighted new tracers and applications of PET/CT imaging as well as therapeutic approaches in patients with advanced breast cancer. Furthermore, we give an outlook on the application of artificial intelligence, immunoPET, and liquid biopsy.", "Clinicians' asthma guideline adherence in asthma care is suboptimal. The effort to improve adherence can be enhanced by assessing and monitoring clinicians' adherence to guidelines reflected in electronic health records (EHRs), which require costly manual chart review because many care elements cannot be identified by structured data.\nThis study was designed to demonstrate the feasibility of an artificial intelligence tool using natural language processing (NLP) leveraging the free text EHRs of pediatric patients to extract key components of the 2007 National Asthma Education and Prevention Program guidelines.\nThis is a retrospective cross-sectional study using a birth cohort with a diagnosis of asthma at Mayo Clinic between 2003 and 2016. We used 1,039 clinical notes with an asthma diagnosis from a random sample of 300 patients. Rule-based NLP algorithms were developed to identify asthma guideline-congruent elements by examining care description in EHR free text.\nNatural language processing algorithms demonstrated a sensitivity (0.82-1.0), specificity (0.95-1.0), positive predictive value (0.86-1.0), and negative predictive value (0.92-1.0) against manual chart review for asthma guideline-congruent elements. Assessing medication compliance and inhaler technique assessment were the most challenging elements to assess because of the complexity and wide variety of descriptions.\nNatural language processing technologies may enable the automated assessment of clinicians' documentation in EHRs regarding adherence to asthma guidelines and can be a useful population management and research tool to assess and monitor asthma care quality. Multisite studies with a larger sample size are needed to assess the generalizability of these NLP algorithms.", "Syndromic craniosynostosis (SC) is a rare entity compared to the non-syndromic variant. Treatment involves a multidisciplinary approach towards a multitude of problems. Early intervention is known to be better for optimum results. We reviewed outcomes of children with SC who underwent reconstructive cranio-facial surgery.\nA retrospective study was conducted using data from hospital case files and the picture archival communication system. Objective data like the cephalic index (CI), both preoperatively and post-operatively, were compared. Subjective data for the cosmesis outcome - \"Sloan and Whitaker outcome class\" - following surgery were assessed. Also, parent-reported outcome measurement (PROM) was performed with various parameters to assess quality of life (QOL).\nWe had 21 operated cases of SC, with 19 needing cranio-facial remodelling. The male to female ratio was 11:10. Crouzon's syndrome was the most common syndromic association followed by Apert's syndrome. Nineteen patients underwent cranio-facial remodelling surgeries and 2 underwent the ventriculo-peritoneal shunt only - for raised intracranial pressure (ICP). Nine patients underwent cranial remodelling with fronto-orbital advancements, and 3 of these patients also received le-fort's type 3 osteotomy and advancement later. Ten patients underwent fronto-orbital advancement with parieto-occipital barrel-stave osteotomies.\nImprovement in the CI was maximum at the 6-month follow-up. Six (37.5%) cases had Sloan class 1 outcome, 9 (56.25%) had class 2 outcomes, and 1 patient had a class 6 outcome. Whitaker cosmesis outcomes - 14 out of 16 cases (87.5%) had Category 1 outcomes. PROM was assessed. All parents reported at least a moderate improvement in cosmesis following surgery. Out of 15 cases, 10 (66%) reported significant improvement, while 4 (26.6%) cases reported moderate improvement with respect to eye and visual problems. Four parents reported snoring as a significant problem even after surgery. Most parents felt that the children were doing well, attending regular school, and social well-being was normal and had an overall good QOL.\nSC cases may have a multitude of other problems like raised ICP, ophthalmological problems, poor intelligence, and cognition apart from cosmetic concerns. PROMs revealed good outcomes in terms of cosmesis, cognition, and ophthalmological and oral cavity-related problems. Significant improvement in overall QOL was seen in most patients following cranio-facial remodelling surgery.", "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most prevalent cardiac dysrhythmia with high morbidity and mortality rate. Evidence shows that in every three patients with AF, one is asymptomatic. The asymptomatic and paroxysmal nature of AF is the reason for unsatisfactory and delayed detection using traditional instruments. Research indicates that wearing a dynamic electrocardiogram (ECG) recorder can guide accurate and safe analysis, interpretation, and distinction of AF from normal sinus rhythm. This is also achievable in an upright position and after exercises, assisted by an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm.\nThis study enrolled 114 participants from the outpatient registry of our institution from June 24, 2020 to July 24, 2020. Participants were tested with a wearable dynamic ECG recorder and 12-lead ECG in a supine, an upright position and after exercises for 60\u00a0s.\nOf the 114 subjects enrolled in the study, 61 had normal sinus rhythm and 53 had AF. The number of cases that could not be determined by the wristband of dynamic ECG recorder was two, one and one respectively. Case results that were not clinically objective were defined as false-negative or false-positive. Results for diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity tested by wearable dynamic ECG recorders in a supine position were 94.74% (95% CI% 88.76-97.80%), 88.68% (95% CI 77.06-95.07%), and 100% (95% CI 92.91-100%), respectively. Meanwhile, the diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity and specificity in an upright position were 97.37% (95% CI 92.21-99.44%), 94.34% (95% CI 84.03-98.65%), and 100% (95% CI 92.91-100%), respectively. Similar results as those of the upright position were obtained after exercise.\nThe widely accessible wearable dynamic ECG recorder integrated with an AI algorithm can efficiently detect AF in different postures and after exercises. As such, this tool holds great promise as a useful and user-friendly screening method for timely AF diagnosis in at-risk individuals.", "Aluminum (Al) powder is commonly encountered in improvised explosive devices (IEDs) as a metallic fuel due to its availability and low cost. Although available commercially in powder form, amateur bomb-makers also produce their own Al powder via simple methods found online. In order to provide investigative leads and forensic intelligence, it is important to evaluate not only the composition of homemade devices, but also to distinguish between the various forms of Al powder they contain. To achieve this goal, a method using automated microscopy in combination with statistical techniques has been demonstrated to have the potential to provide source discrimination and investigative leads in source attribution of Al powders in IEDs. The present research refined this method and investigated 59 industrially and amateurly produced Al powder sources with seven subsamples per source using two traditional linear discriminant analyses (LDA), one with a standard data split for training and testing, and another using leave-one-out cross-validation. Averaging the classification accuracies for the two LDA-based analyses, LDA has the ability to correctly classify 59.26%, 83.35%, and 80.69% of the samples based on their powder source, type, and production method, respectively. This classification accuracy represents a 3407%, 317%, and 61.38% increase in accuracy from random class assignment, respectively. Further, in most instances of incorrect data attribution to a particular source, the subsample has been misidentified with another sample of the same powder type or production method.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) provides a promising substitution for streamlining COVID-19 diagnoses. However, concerns surrounding security and trustworthiness impede the collection of large-scale representative medical data, posing a considerable challenge for training a well-generalised model in clinical practices. To address this, we launch the Unified CT-COVID AI Diagnostic Initiative (UCADI), where the AI model can be distributedly trained and independently executed at each host institution under a federated learning framework (FL) without data sharing. Here we show that our FL model outperformed all the local models by a large yield (test sensitivity /specificity in China: 0.973/0.951, in the UK: 0.730/0.942), achieving comparable performance with a panel of professional radiologists. We further evaluated the model on the hold-out (collected from another two hospitals leaving out the FL) and heterogeneous (acquired with contrast materials) data, provided visual explanations for decisions made by the model, and analysed the trade-offs between the model performance and the communication costs in the federated training process. Our study is based on 9,573 chest computed tomography scans (CTs) from 3,336 patients collected from 23 hospitals located in China and the UK. Collectively, our work advanced the prospects of utilising federated learning for privacy-preserving AI in digital health.", "The convergence of digital pathology and computer vision is increasingly enabling computers to perform tasks performed by humans. As a result, artificial intelligence (AI) is having an astoundingly positive effect on the field of pathology, including breast pathology. Research using machine learning and the development of algorithms that learn patterns from labeled digital data based on \"deep learning\" neural networks and feature-engineered approaches to analyze histology images have recently provided promising results. Thus far, image analysis and more complex AI-based tools have demonstrated excellent success performing tasks such as the quantification of breast biomarkers and Ki67, mitosis detection, lymph node metastasis recognition, tissue segmentation for diagnosing breast carcinoma, prognostication, computational assessment of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, and prediction of molecular expression as well as treatment response and benefit of therapy from routine H&E images. This review critically examines the literature regarding these applications of AI in the area of breast pathology.", "The innovation of biotechnologies has allowed the accumulation of omics data at an alarming rate, thus introducing the era of 'big data'. Extracting inherent valuable knowledge from various omics data remains a daunting problem in bioinformatics. Better solutions often need some kind of more innovative methods for efficient handlings and effective results. Recent advancements in integrated analysis and computational modeling of multi-omics data helped address such needs in an increasingly harmonious manner. The development and application of machine learning have largely advanced our insights into biology and biomedicine and greatly promoted the development of therapeutic strategies, especially for precision medicine. Here, we propose a comprehensive survey and discussion on what happened, is happening and will happen when machine learning meets omics. Specifically, we describe how artificial intelligence can be applied to omics studies and review recent advancements at the interface between machine learning and the ever-widest range of omics including genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, radiomics, as well as those at the single-cell resolution. We also discuss and provide a synthesis of ideas, new insights, current challenges and perspectives of machine learning in omics.", "The COVID-19 pandemic has created an extraordinary medical, economic and humanitarian emergency. Artificial intelligence, in combination with other digital technologies, is being used as a tool to support the fight against the viral pandemic that has affected the entire world since the beginning of 2020. Barcelona Supercomputing Center collaborates in the battle against the coronavirus in different areas: the application of bioinformatics for the research on the virus and its possible treatments, the use of artificial intelligence, natural language processing and big data techniques to analyse the spread and impact of the pandemic, and the use of the MareNostrum 4 supercomputer to enable massive analysis on COVID-19 data. Many of these activities have included the use of personal and sensitive data of citizens, which, even during a pandemic, should be treated and handled with care. In this work we discuss our approach based on an ethical, transparent and fair use of this information, an approach aligned with the guidelines proposed by the European Union.", "Medication adherence is generally low and challenging to address because patient actions control healthcare delivery outside of medical environments. Behavioral nudging changes clinician behavior, but nudging patient decision-making requires further testing. This trial evaluated whether behavioral nudges can increase statin adherence, measured as the proportion of days covered (PDC).\nIn a 12-month parallel-group, unblinded, randomized controlled trial, adult patients in Intermountain Healthcare cardiology clinics were enrolled. Inclusion required an indication for statins and membership in SelectHealth insurance. Subjects were randomized 1:1 to control or nudges. Nudge content, timing, frequency, and delivery route were personalized by CareCentra using machine learning of subject motivations and abilities from psychographic assessment, demographics, social determinants, and the Intermountain Mortality Risk Score. PDC calculation used SelectHealth claims data.\nAmong 182 subjects, age averaged 63.2\u00b18.5 years, 25.8% were female, baseline LDL-C was 82.5\u00b132.7 mg/dL, and 93.4% had coronary disease. Characteristics were balanced between nudge (n\u00a0=\u00a089) and control arms (n\u00a0=\u00a093). The statin PDC was greater at 12 months in the nudge group (PDC: 0.742\u00b10.318) compared to controls (PDC: 0.639\u00b10.358, P\u00a0=\u00a00.042). Adherent subjects (PDC \u226580%) were more concentrated in the nudge group (66.3% vs controls: 50.5%, P\u00a0=\u00a00.036) while a composite of death, myocardial infarction, stroke, and revascularization was non-significant (nudges: 6.7% vs control: 10.8%, P\u00a0=\u00a00.44).\nPersuasive behavioral nudges driven by artificial intelligence resulted in a clinically important increase in statin adherence in general cardiology patients. This precision patient decision support utilized computerized nudge design and delivery with minimal on-going human input.", "This study evaluated the impact of an emotional intelligence (EI) workshop as a tool to improve student pharmacists' self-awareness. The primary objectives were to assess the change in student pharmacists' self-awareness as measured by the Self-Awareness Outcomes Questionnaire (SAOQ) and identify trends in their self-reflection.\nA four-hour EI workshop was delivered in a first-year required student pharmacist leadership course. The components of the workshop included: an EI assessment via the Emotional Quotient Inventory (EQ-i 2.0) administered to student pharmacists outside of class, active learning class time that applied the principles of EI to leadership and group dynamics, and peer-to-peer discussions. Personal results of the EQ-i 2.0 were reviewed individually and in small groups. Student pharmacists completed a self-reflection and EI action plan outside of class. The SAOQ was completed before and after the workshop and the aggregated Likert scales were analyzed by paired t-tests.\nAfter two consecutive course offerings of the workshop (N\u00a0=\u00a0100), there was a significant increase in the total SAOQ score as well as a significant increase for the three positive subscales: reflective self-development, acceptance, and proactivity. There was no change in the negative subscale: emotional costs. Student pharmacists positively perceived the workshop and reported that the activities motivated students to improve their interpersonal skills and increase extracurricular involvement.\nImplementing an EI workshop is an effective curricular method to improve the affective domain of student development, specifically self-awareness.", "Today's intelligent computing environments, including the Internet of Things (IoT), Cloud Computing (CC), Fog Computing (FC), and Edge Computing (EC), allow many organizations worldwide to optimize their resource allocation regarding the quality of service and energy consumption. Due to the acute conditions of utilizing resources by users and the real-time nature of the data, a comprehensive and integrated computing environment has not yet provided a robust and reliable capability for proper resource allocation. Although traditional resource allocation approaches in a low-capacity hardware resource system are efficient for small-scale resource providers, for a complex system in the conditions of dynamic computing resources and fierce competition in obtaining resources, they cannot develop and adaptively manage the conditions optimally. To optimize the resource allocation with minimal delay, low energy consumption, minimum computational complexity, high scalability, and better resource utilization efficiency, CC/FC/EC/IoT-based computing architectures should be designed intelligently. Therefore, the objective of this research is a comprehensive survey on resource allocation problems using computational intelligence-based evolutionary optimization and mathematical game theory approaches in different computing environments according to the latest scientific research achievements.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) can enhance the efficiency of medical imaging quality control and clinical documentation, provide clinical decision support, and increase image acquisition and processing quality. A clear understanding of the basic tenets of these technologies and their impact will enable nuclear medicine technologists to train for performing advanced imaging tasks. AI-enabled medical devices' anticipated role and impact on routine nuclear medicine workflow (scheduling, quality control, check-in, radiotracer injection, waiting room, image planning, image acquisition, image post-processing) is reviewed in this article. With the assistance of AI, newly compiled patient imaging data can be customized to encompass personalized risk assessments of patients' disease burden, along with the development of individualized treatment plans. Nuclear medicine technologists will continue to play a crucial role on the medical team, collaborating with patients and radiologists to improve each patient's imaging experience and supervising the performance of integrated AI applications.", "The dermatoscope has gained tremendous popularity among dermatologists as an adjunctive tool to better visualize subsurface structures and identify patterns that may improve the diagnosis of a wide range of skin diseases. Initially, the pigmented lesion experts who were the early adopters promoted the use of the dermatoscope to increase diagnostic accuracy of early melanomas and decrease the harvesting of benign lesions. With current near universal adoption of the diagnostic technique by dermatologists, the dermatoscope is now employed to help identify a wide variety of inflammatory, infectious, and vascular conditions of the skin, hair, and nails, resulting in the emergence of several branches of dermatoscopy-inflammoscopy, trichoscopy, onychoscopy, and entodermoscopy. The future of dermatoscopy will involve incorporation of artificial intelligence that will make the assessment process increasingly objective, more accurate, and universally available. Despite the wide acceptance and adoption of dermatoscopy, the overall impact of its widespread use still\u00a0remains unclear, whether it has decreased biopsy rates of benign lesions, reduced health care costs, or improved patient outcomes.", "This is the first scoping review to focus broadly on the topics of machine learning and medication adherence.\nThis review aims to categorize, summarize, and analyze literature focused on using machine learning for actions related to medication adherence.\nPubMed, Scopus, ACM Digital Library, IEEE, and Web of Science were searched to find works that meet the inclusion criteria. After full-text review, 43 works were included in the final analysis. Information of interest was systematically charted before inclusion in the final draft. Studies were placed into natural categories for additional analysis dependent upon the combination of actions related to medication adherence. The protocol for this scoping review was created using the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews) guidelines.\nPublications focused on predicting medication adherence have uncovered 20 strong predictors that were significant in two or more studies. A total of 13 studies that predicted medication adherence used either self-reported questionnaires or pharmacy claims data to determine medication adherence status. In addition, 13 studies that predicted medication adherence did so using either logistic regression, artificial neural networks, random forest, or support vector machines. Of the 15 studies that predicted medication adherence, 6 reported predictor accuracy, the lowest of which was 77.6%. Of 13 monitoring systems, 12 determined medication administration using medication container sensors or sensors in consumer electronics, like smartwatches or smartphones. A total of 11 monitoring systems used logistic regression, artificial neural networks, support vector machines, or random forest algorithms to determine medication administration. The 4 systems that monitored inhaler administration reported a classification accuracy of 93.75% or higher. The 2 systems that monitored medication status in patients with Parkinson disease reported a classification accuracy of 78% or higher. A total of 3 studies monitored medication administration using only smartwatch sensors and reported a classification accuracy of 78.6% or higher. Two systems that provided context-aware medication reminders helped patients to achieve an adherence level of 92% or higher. Two conversational artificial intelligence reminder systems significantly improved adherence rates when compared against traditional reminder systems.\nCreation of systems that accurately predict medication adherence across multiple data sets may be possible due to predictors remaining strong across multiple studies. Higher quality measures of adherence should be adopted when possible so that prediction algorithms are based on accurate information. Currently, medication adherence can be predicted with a good level of accuracy, potentially allowing for the development of interventions aimed at preventing nonadherence. Monitoring systems that track inhaler use currently classify inhaler-related actions with an excellent level of accuracy, allowing for tracking of adherence and potentially proper inhaler technique. Systems that monitor medication states in patients with Parkinson disease can currently achieve a good level of classification accuracy and have the potential to inform medication therapy changes in the future. Medication administration monitoring systems that only use motion sensors in smartwatches can currently achieve a good level of classification accuracy but only when differentiating between a small number of possible activities. Context-aware reminder systems can help patients achieve high levels of medication adherence but are also intrusive, which may not be acceptable to users. Conversational artificial intelligence reminder systems can significantly improve adherence.", "As whole-genome sequencing for pathogen genomes becomes increasingly popular, the typing methods of gene-by-gene comparison, such as core genome multilocus sequence typing (cgMLST) and whole-genome multilocus sequence typing (wgMLST), are being routinely implemented in molecular epidemiology. However, some intrinsic problems remain. For example, genomic sequences with varying read depths, read lengths, and assemblers influence the genome assemblies, introducing error or missing alleles into the generated allelic profiles. These errors and missing alleles might create \"specious discrepancy\" among closely related isolates, thus making accurate epidemiological interpretation challenging. In addition, the rapid growth of the cgMLST allelic profile database can cause problems related to storage and maintenance as well as long query search times.\nWe attempted to resolve these issues by decreasing the scheme size to reduce the occurrence of error and missing alleles, alleviate the storage burden, and improve the query search time. The challenge in this approach is maintaining the typing resolution when using fewer loci. We achieved this by using a popular artificial intelligence technique, XGBoost, coupled with Shapley additive explanations for feature selection. Finally, 370 loci from the original 1701 cgMLST loci of Listeria monocytogenes were selected.\nAlthough the size of the final scheme (LmScheme_370) was approximately 80% lower than that of the original cgMLST scheme, its discriminatory power, tested for 35 outbreaks, was concordant with that of the original cgMLST scheme. Although we used L. monocytogenes as a demonstration in this study, the approach can be applied to other schemes and pathogens. Our findings might help elucidate gene-by-gene-based epidemiology.", "The present study aims to estimate nitrogen (N) content in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) plant leaves using optimal hyperspectral imaging data by means of computational intelligence [artificial neural networks and the differential evolution algorithm (ANN-DE), partial least squares regression (PLSR), and convolutional neural network (CNN) regression] to detect potential plant stress to nutrients at early stages. First, pots containing control and treated tomato plants were prepared; three treatments (categories or classes) consisted in the application of an overdose of 30%, 60%, and 90% nitrogen fertilizer, called N-30%, N-60%, N-90%, respectively. Tomato plant leaves were then randomly picked up before and after the application of nitrogen excess and imaged. Leaf images were captured by a hyperspectral camera, and nitrogen content was measured by laboratory ordinary destructive methods. Two approaches were studied: either using all the spectral data in the visible (Vis) and near infrared (NIR) spectral bands, or selecting only the three most effective wavelengths by an optimization algorithm. Regression coefficients (R) were 0.864\u00b10.027 for ANN-DE, 0.837\u00b10.027 for PLSR, and 0.875\u00b10.026 for CNN in the first approach, over the test set. The second approach used different models for each treatment, achieving R values for all the regression methods above 0.96; however, it needs a previous classification stage of the samples in one of the three nitrogen excess classes under consideration.", "Diabetes has been associated with affective disorders which complicate the management of the disease. Emotional intelligence (EI), or the ability to perceive, facilitate, understand, and regulate emotions, has shown to be a protective factor of emotional disorders in general population. The main objective of this study was to systematically review the role of the EI construct in Type 1 and Type 2 diabetics and to observe how EI is related to biological and psychological variables. Comprehensive searches were conducted in PubMed, Scopus, PsycInfo, and Cochrane without time limitations, for studies examining the link between diabetes and EI. A total of 12 eligible studies were selected according to the inclusion criteria. We divided the results into four sections: (1) EI and hemoglobin glycosylated (HbA1c), (2) EI training effects, (3) differences in EI between persons with diabetes and without diabetes, and (4) EI and psychological adjustment and well-being. The results showed negative correlations between EI and HbA1c, positive effects of EI training on quality of life, anxiety, and glycemic control, no differences in EI between people with diabetes and healthy individuals, and, finally, negative correlations between EI and different psychological variables such as diabetes-related anxiety and distress, and positive correlations with quality of life, well-being, and marital satisfaction. This systematic review offers a starting point for a theoretical and practical understanding of the role played by EI in the management of diabetes and reveals that EI is a promising protective factor for biological and psychological variables in this population.", "The 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic revealed the urgent need for the acceleration of vaccine development worldwide. Rapid vaccine development poses numerous risks for each category of vaccine technology. By using the Risklick artificial intelligence (AI), we estimated the risks associated with all types of COVID-19 vaccine during the early phase of vaccine development. We then performed a postmortem analysis of the probability and the impact matrix calculations by comparing the 2020 prognosis to the contemporary situation. We used the Risklick AI to evaluate the risks and their incidence associated with vaccine development in the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our analysis revealed the diversity of risks among vaccine technologies currently used by pharmaceutical companies providing vaccines. This analysis highlighted the current and future potential pitfalls connected to vaccine production during the COVID-19 pandemic. Hence, the Risklick AI appears as an essential tool in vaccine development for the treatment of COVID-19 in order to formally anticipate the risks, and increases the overall performance from the production to the distribution of the vaccines. The Risklick AI could, therefore, be extended to other fields of research and development and represent a novel opportunity in the calculation of production-associated risks.", "Trust in artificial intelligence (AI) by society and the development of trustworthy AI systems and ecosystems are critical for the progress and implementation of AI technology in medicine. With the growing use of AI in a variety of medical and imaging applications, it is more vital than ever to make these systems dependable and trustworthy. Fourteen core principles are considered in this article aiming to move the needle more closely to systems that are accurate, resilient, fair, explainable, safe, and transparent: toward trustworthy AI.", "Wuhan Leishenshan/Leishenshan (\"Leishenshan\" for short) hospital is a makeshift emergency hospital for treating patients diagnosed with the novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia (NCIP). Engineering construction uses modular composite building finished products to the greatest extent, which reduces the workload of field operations and saves a lot of time. The building information model (BIM) technology assists in design and construction work to meet rapid construction requirements. Besides, based on the unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) data analysis and application platform, digitization and intelligence in engineering construction are improved. Simultaneously, on-site construction and overall hoisting were carried out to achieve maximum efficiency. This article aims to take the construction of Leishenshan Hospital as an example to illustrate how to adopt BIM technology and other high-tech technology such as big data, artificial intelligence, drones, and 5G for the fast construction of the fabricated steel structure systems in emergency engineering projects.", "The Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) permits persons with impairments to interact with the real world without using the neuromuscular pathways. BCIs are based on artificial intelligence piloted systems. They collect brain activity patterns linked to the mental process and transform them into commands for actuators. The potential application of BCI systems is in the rehabilitation centres. In this context, a novel method is devised for automated identification of the Motor Imagery (MI) tasks. The contribution is an effective hybridization of the Multiscale Principal Component Analysis (MSPCA), Wavelet Packet Decomposition (WPD), statistical features extraction from subbands, and ensemble learning-based classifiers for categorization of the MI tasks. The intended electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are segmented and denoised. The denoising is achieved with a Daubechies algorithm-based wavelet transform (WT) incorporated in the MSPCA. The WT with the 5th level of decomposition is used. Onward, the Wavelet Packet Decomposition (WPD), with the 4th level of decomposition, is used for subbands formation. The statistical features are selected from each subband, namely, mean absolute value, average power, standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis. Also, ratios of absolute mean values of adjacent subbands are computed and concatenated with other extracted features. Finally, the ensemble machine learning approach is used for the classification of MI tasks. The usefulness is evaluated by using the BCI competition III, MI dataset IVa. Results revealed that the suggested ensemble learning approach yields the highest classification accuracies of 98.69% and 94.83%, respectively, for the cases of subject-dependent and subject-independent problems.", "Radical cystectomy for urinary bladder cancer is a procedure associated with a high risk of complications, and poor overall survival (OS) due to both patient and tumour factors. Sarcopenia is one such patient factor. We have developed a fully automated artificial intelligence (AI)-based image analysis tool for segmenting skeletal muscle of the torso and calculating the muscle volume.\nAll patients who have undergone radical cystectomy for urinary bladder cancer 2011-2019 at Sahlgrenska University Hospital, and who had a pre-operative computed tomography of the abdomen within 90 days of surgery were included in the study. All patients CT studies were analysed with the automated AI-based image analysis tool. Clinical data for the patients were retrieved from the Swedish National Register for Urinary Bladder Cancer. Muscle volumes dichotomised by the median for each sex were analysed with Cox regression for OS and logistic regression for 90-day high-grade complications. The study was approved by the Swedish Ethical Review Authority (2020-03985).\nOut of 445 patients who underwent surgery, 299 (67%) had CT studies available for analysis. The automated AI-based tool failed to segment the muscle volume in seven (2%) patients. Cox regression analysis showed an independent significant association with OS (HR 1.62; 95% CI 1.07-2.44; p\u2009=\u20090.022). Logistic regression did not show any association with high-grade complications.\nThe fully automated AI-based CT image analysis provides a low-cost and meaningful clinical measure that is an independent biomarker for OS following radical cystectomy.", "Thallium, a highly toxic heavy metal and priority pollutant, has been widely reported to cause neurodevelopmental toxicity in animals. However, accessible epidemiological studies concerning the neurodevelopmental toxicity of early-life thallium exposure in humans are limited. In a prospective birth cohort including 2164 mother-child pairs, we explored the effect of prenatal serum thallium exposure on cognitive development among preschool-aged children born in Ma'anshan, Anhui, China. Serum thallium concentrations were measured in the first trimester, second trimester, third trimester, and cord blood by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Child cognitive development was appraised by the Chinese version of the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence-Fourth Edition (WPPSI-IV) at 4.5 years old. Multiple informants generalized estimating equations (GEEs) were fit to jointly estimate the association between the four repeated measurements of thallium concentrations and the preschool-aged children's cognitive test scores. After adjusting for potential confounders, the visual spatial index (VSI) was 1.45 points lower in the highest tertile of serum thallium during the first trimester than in the lowest tertile (p for trend\u00a0=\u00a00.04). Moreover, children in the highest tertile of serum thallium during the third trimester had a significantly lower full-scale intelligence quotient (FSIQ) (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-1.51, 95% CI: -2.68, -0.35), VSI (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-1.79, 95% CI: -3.16, -0.42), fluid reasoning index (FRI) (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-1.41, 95% CI: -2.73, -0.10), and processing speed index (PSI) (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-1.47, 95% CI: -2.71, -0.24) scores than the children in the lowest tertile. When performing stratified analysis by child sex, the associations of first- and third-trimester thallium concentrations with cognitive test scores were more prominent in boys than in girls. Our findings revealed that maternal serum thallium exposure during the first and third trimesters, but not other periods, had detrimental effects on preschoolers' cognitive development, and these effects showed sex differences.", "Given widespread excitement around predictive analytics and the proliferation of machine learning algorithms that predict outcomes, a key next step is understanding how this information is-or should be-communicated with patients.\nWe conducted a scoping review informed by PRISMA-ScR guidelines to identify current knowledge and gaps in this domain.\nTen studies met inclusion criteria for full text review. The following topics were represented in the studies, some of which involved more than 1 topic: disease prevention (N\u2009=\u20095/10, 50%), treatment decisions (N\u2009=\u20095/10, 50%), medication harms reduction (N\u2009=\u20091/10, 10%), and presentation of cardiovascular risk information (N\u2009=\u20095/10, 50%). A single study included 6- and 12-month clinical outcome metrics.\nAs predictive models are increasingly published, marketed by industry, and implemented, this paucity of relevant research poses important gaps. Published studies identified the importance of (1) identifying the most effective source of information for patient communications; (2) contextualizing risk information and associated design elements based on users' needs and problem areas; and (3) understanding potential impacts on risk factor modification and behavior change dependent on risk presentation.\nAn opportunity remains for researchers and practitioners to share strategies for effective selection of predictive algorithms for clinical practice, approaches for educating clinicians and patients in effectively using predictive data, and new approaches for framing patient-provider communication in the era of artificial intelligence.", "Artificial intelligence technology is emerging as a promising entity in cardiovascular medicine, potentially improving diagnosis and patient care. In this article, we review the literature on artificial intelligence and its utility in cardiology. We provide a detailed description of concepts of artificial intelligence tools like machine learning, deep learning, and cognitive computing. This review discusses the current evidence, application, prospects, and limitations of artificial intelligence in cardiology.", "Wastewater contains a wealth of information about the inhabitants of cities. Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) has become an effective tool for monitoring public health by analyzing various biomarkers (e.g., chemicals and microorganisms) in wastewater. This way, the estimation of pharmaceuticals' consumption behavior and/or illicit drugs can be calculated. However, monitoring consumption alone is not the only option. If we consider wastewater as a statistical representation of the population's health, medical information can be derived. In this work, we used data from 15 different wastewater treatment plants in Slovak Republic to explore correlations between the use of typical pharmaceuticals and illicit drugs. The analysis was based on the wastewater monitoring data from four years (2016-2019), and 68 different compounds were taken into account. One of the strongest correlations found was between Antihyperlipidemics and Antihypertensives, with Pearson's correlation coefficient of 0.82. This type of analysis within the WBE represents a new potential as an additional source of information for the pharmaceutical, medical and government sectors in assessing health risk factors in the population. Such an evaluation method has even a great potential for artificial intelligence and machine learning for calculating health risk factors together with other sources of data.", "The aim of this study is to recommend an automatic caries detection and segmentation model based on the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) algorithms in dental bitewing radiographs using VGG-16 and U-Net architecture and evaluate the clinical performance of the model comparing to human observer.\nA total of 621 anonymized bitewing radiographs were used to progress the Artificial Intelligence (AI) system (CranioCatch, Eskisehir, Turkey) for the detection and segmentation of caries lesions. The radiographs were obtained from the Radiology Archive of the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Radiology of the Faculty of Dentistry of Ordu University. VGG-16 and U-Net implemented with PyTorch models were used for the detection and segmentation of caries lesions, respectively.\nThe sensitivity, precision, and F-measure rates for caries detection and caries segmentation were 0.84, 0.81; 0.84, 0.86; and 0.84, 0.84, respectively. Comparing to 5 different experienced observers and AI models on external radiographic dataset, AI models showed superiority to assistant specialists.\nCNN-based AI algorithms can have the potential to detect and segmentation of dental caries accurately and effectively in bitewing radiographs. AI algorithms based on the deep-learning method have the potential to assist clinicians in routine clinical practice for quickly and reliably detecting the tooth caries. The use of these algorithms in clinical practice can provide to important benefit to physicians as a clinical decision support system in dentistry.", "In 2020, Pesta et al. published an article entitled \"Racial and Ethnic Group Differences in the Heritability of Intelligence: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis\" in the journal Intelligence. The authors framed their analysis as an examination of the Scarr-Rowe hypothesis, which holds that the heritability of intelligence varies as a function of socioeconomic status. Pesta et al. concluded that the heritability of intelligence does not differ across racial and ethnic groups in the United States. They claimed their results challenge the Scarr-Rowe hypothesis and support the hereditarian position that mean differences in IQ among racial and ethnic groups are attributable to genetic differences rather than environmental disparities. In this commentary, we outline severe theoretical, methodological, and rhetorical flaws in every step of Pesta et al.'s meta-analysis. The most reliable finding from Pesta et al. is consistent with the Scarr-Rowe hypothesis and directly contradicts a hereditarian understanding of group differences in intelligence. Finally, we suggest that Pesta et al. serves as an example of how racially motivated and poorly executed work can find its way into a mainstream scientific journal, underscoring the importance of robust peer review and rigorous editorial judgment in the open-science era.", "Screening for colorectal cancer (CRC) in Lynch syndrome enables early detection and likely cancer prevention. CRC screening guidelines have evolved from universal to gene-specific recommendations based on lifetime neoplasia risks. Regular screening for Lynch syndrome reduces CRC-related mortality; however, high CRC incidence during regular colonoscopy screening suggests the possibility of nonpolypoid carcinogenesis. Colonoscopy is the primary modality for screening for Lynch syndrome with mixed and emerging data on quality metrics, chromoendoscopy, artificial intelligence, and nonendoscopic modalities. Screening adherence varies across studies. In this review, we present the current state of CRC screening recommendations, outcomes, and modalities in Lynch syndrome.", "The simulation of biological dendrite computations is vital for the development of artificial intelligence (AI). This article presents a basic machine-learning (ML) algorithm, called Dendrite Net or DD, just like the support vector machine (SVM) or multilayer perceptron (MLP). DD's main concept is that the algorithm can recognize this class after learning, if the output's logical expression contains the corresponding class's logical relationship among inputs (and \\ or \\ not). Experiments and main results: DD, a white-box ML algorithm, showed excellent system identification performance for the black-box system. Second, it was verified by nine real-world applications that DD brought better generalization capability relative to the MLP architecture that imitated neurons' cell body (Cell body Net) for regression. Third, by MNIST and FASHION-MNIST datasets, it was verified that DD showed higher testing accuracy under greater training loss than the cell body net for classification. The number of modules can effectively adjust DD's logical expression capacity, which avoids overfitting and makes it easy to get a model with outstanding generalization capability. Finally, repeated experiments in MATLAB and PyTorch (Python) demonstrated that DD was faster than Cell body Net both in epoch and forwardpropagation. The main contribution of this article is the basic ML algorithm (DD) with a white-box attribute, controllable precision for better generalization capability, and lower computational complexity. Not only can DD be used for generalized engineering, but DD has vast development potential as a module for deep learning. DD code is available at https://github.com/liugang1234567/Gang-neuron.", "Chest X-ray (CXR) imaging is a standard and crucial examination method used for suspected cases of coronavirus disease (COVID-19). In profoundly affected or limited resource areas, CXR imaging is preferable owing to its availability, low cost, and rapid results. However, given the rapidly spreading nature of COVID-19, such tests could limit the efficiency of pandemic control and prevention. In response to this issue, artificial intelligence methods such as deep learning are promising options for automatic diagnosis because they have achieved state-of-the-art performance in the analysis of visual information and a wide range of medical images. This paper reviews and critically assesses the preprint and published reports between March and May 2020 for the diagnosis of COVID-19 via CXR images using convolutional neural networks and other deep learning architectures. Despite the encouraging results, there is an urgent need for public, comprehensive, and diverse datasets. Further investigations in terms of explainable and justifiable decisions are also required for more robust, transparent, and accurate predictions.", "This article summarizes a broad range of the most recent advances and future directions in stroke diagnostics, endovascular robotics, and neuromodulation.\nIn the past 5 years, the field of interventional neurology has seen major technological advances for the diagnosis and treatment of cerebrovascular diseases. Several new technologies became available to aid in complex prehospital stroke triage, stroke diagnosis, and interpretation of radiologic findings. Robotics and neuromodulation promise to expand access to established treatments and broaden neuroendovascular indications.\nMobile applications offer a solution to simplify prehospital diagnostic and transfer decisions. Several prehospital devices are also under development to improve the accuracy of detection of large vessel occlusion (LVO). Artificial intelligence is now routinely used in early diagnosis of LVO and for detecting salvageability of the affected brain parenchyma. Technological advances have also paved the way to incorporate endovascular robotics and neuromodulation into practice. This may expand the deliverability of established treatments and facilitate the development of cutting-edge treatments for other complex neurologic diseases.", "Whether working memory training is effective in enhancing fluid intelligence remains in dispute. Several researchers, who doubt the training benefits, consider that placebo effects may be the reason for positive training gains. One of the vital variables that may induce the placebo effect is the mindset of intelligence. In this article, we provide a test of whether the mindset of intelligence leads to placebo effects in working memory training. Participants were overtly recruited and allocated to the growth mindset group or the fixed mindset group by Theories of Intelligence Scale scores. A single, 1 h session working memory training is the cue to introduce the placebo effects. During pre/post-testing, all participants completed tasks measuring working memory capacity (near transfer) and fluid intelligence (far transfer). Our findings show no significant difference between the two groups in both tasks. Therefore, these results suggest that the placebo effect does not exist in this study, which means individuals' mindset of intelligence may not be a contributor to the placebo effect in 1 h working memory training. This research will further help to clarify the mechanism of the placebo effect in working memory training.", "The discourse on the ethics of artificial intelligence (AI) has generated a plethora of different conventions, principles and guidelines outlining an ethical perspective on the use and research of AI. However, when it comes to breaking down general implications to specific use cases, existent frameworks have been remaining vague. The following paper aims to fill this gap by examining the ethical implications of the use of information analytical systems through a management approach for filtering the content in social media and preventing information thrusts with negative consequences for human beings and public administration. The ethical dimensions of AI technologies are revealed through deduction of general challenges of digital governance to applied level management technics.", "Value sensitive design (VSD) is an established method for integrating values into technical design. It has been applied to different technologies and, more recently, to artificial intelligence (AI). We argue that AI poses a number of challenges specific to VSD that require a somewhat modified VSD approach. Machine learning (ML), in particular, poses two challenges. First, humans may not understand how an AI system learns certain things. This requires paying attention to values such as transparency, explicability, and accountability. Second, ML may lead to AI systems adapting in ways that 'disembody' the values embedded in them. To address this, we propose a threefold modified VSD approach: (1) integrating a known set of VSD principles (AI4SG) as design norms from which more specific design requirements can be derived; (2) distinguishing between values that are promoted and respected by the design to ensure outcomes that not only do no harm but also contribute to good, and (3) extending the VSD process to encompass the whole life cycle of an AI technology to monitor unintended value consequences and redesign as needed. We illustrate our VSD for AI approach with an example use case of a SARS-CoV-2 contact tracing app.", "Fluid intelligence (G\u0192) includes logical reasoning abilities and is an essential component of normative cognition. Despite the broad consensus that parieto-prefrontal connectivity is critical for G\u0192 (e.g. the parieto-frontal integration theory of intelligence, P-FIT), the dynamics of such functional connectivity during logical reasoning remains poorly understood. Further, given the known importance of these brain regions for G\u0192, numerous studies have targeted one or both of these areas with non-invasive stimulation with the goal of improving G\u0192, but to date there remains little consensus on the overall stimulation-related effects. To examine this, we applied high-definition direct current anodal stimulation to the left and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) of 24 healthy adults for 20\u00a0min in three separate sessions (sham, left, and right active). Following stimulation, participants completed a logical reasoning task during magnetoencephalography (MEG). Significant neural responses at the sensor-level were imaged using a beamformer, and peak task-induced activity was subjected to dynamic functional connectivity analyses to evaluate the impact of distinct stimulation montages on network activity. We found that participants responded faster following right DLPFC stimulation vs. sham. Moreover, our neural findings followed a similar trajectory of effects such that left parieto-frontal connectivity decreased following right and left DLPFC stimulation compared to sham, with connectivity following right stimulation being significantly correlated with the faster reaction times. Importantly, our findings are consistent with P-FIT, as well as the neural efficiency hypothesis (NEH) of intelligence. In sum, this study provides evidence for beneficial effects of right DLPFC stimulation on logical reasoning. KEY POINTS: Logical reasoning is an indispensable component of fluid intelligence and involves multispectral oscillatory activity in parietal and frontal regions. Parieto-frontal integration is well characterized in logical reasoning; however, its direct neural quantification and neuromodulation by brain stimulation remain poorly understood. High-definition transcranial direct current stimulation of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) had modulatory effects on task performance and neural interactions serving logical reasoning, with right stimulation showing beneficial effects. Right DLPFC stimulation led to a decrease in the response time (i.e. better task performance) and left parieto-frontal connectivity with a marginal positive association between behavioural and neural metrics. Other modes of targeted stimulation of DLPFC (e.g. frequency-specific) can be employed in future studies.", "The field of cellular microbiology, rooted in the co-evolution of microbes and their hosts, studies intracellular pathogens and their manipulation of host cell machinery. In this review, we highlight emerging technologies and infection models that recently promoted opportunities in cellular microbiology. We overview the explosion of microscopy techniques and how they reveal unprecedented detail at the host-pathogen interface. We discuss the incorporation of robotics and artificial intelligence to image-based screening modalities, biochemical mapping approaches, as well as dual RNA-sequencing techniques. Finally, we describe chips, organoids and animal models used to dissect biophysical and in vivo aspects of the infection process. As our knowledge of the infected cell improves, cellular microbiology holds great promise for development of anti-infective strategies with translational applications in human health.", "Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been rapidly embraced by imaging fields and offers a variety of benefits in nuclear medicine; however, the biggest hurdles to AI in health care will likely not be technological but legal. What happens when an error occurs in the AI setting? A variety of legal causes of action, ranging from medical malpractice, to notions of vicarious liability/agency to products liability may come into play in an AI-related lawsuit. Physicians working with AI need to understand these causes of action, stay abreast of legal developments in AI, and advocate for appropriate guidelines and legislation.", "In recent years, research on behavioral and psychiatric problems of adults with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) has gained attention. However, no report is available regarding the relationship between psychiatric illness and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in patients with PWS. Therefore, we evaluated a behavioral assessment to address the lack of data on the association between psychiatric behavior and T2DM.\nThis was a retrospective single-center study of patients with PWS. Patients with PWS whose blood tests were performed in our hospital between January 2018 and December 2019 and aged >10\u00a0years were included. We evaluated the data, including the behavioral patterns of Japanese PWS patients with T2DM.\nOverall, 114 patients were evaluated; 33 patients (28.9%) developed T2DM. The age of T2DM onset was 18.0\u00a0years (interquartile range [IQR], 14.6-21.4\u00a0years). The median body mass index at T2DM onset was 33.7\u00a0kg/m2 (IQR, 30.0-37.4\u00a0kg/m2). Between-group comparisons of the intelligence quotient, Food-Related Problem Questionnaire (FRPQ), and Japanese versions of the Short Sensory Profile and Aberrant Behavior Checklist showed a significant difference only in FRPQ scores (p=0.003).\nThe occurrence of T2DM among Japanese patients with PWS remains high. Only the FRPQ was significantly different between the T2DM and the non-T2DM group.", "Dermatology and medicine are producing data at an increasing rate that are progressively difficult to sort and manage. Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning are examples of tools that may have the capability to produce significant and meaningful results from these data. Currently, AI and machine learning have a variety of applications in medicine including, but not limited to, diagnostics, patient management, preventive medicine, and genomic analysis. Although the role of AI in dermatology is greater than ever, its use is still extremely limited. As AI is continually developed and implemented, it is essential that stakeholders understand AI terminology, applications, limitations, and projected uses in dermatology. With the continued development of AI technology, however, its implementation may afford greater dermatologist efficiency, greater increased patient access to dermatologic care, and improved patient outcomes.", "The exponential growth in digital technology coupled with the global coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic is driving a profound change in the delivery of medical care and research conduct. The growing availability of electronic monitoring, electronic health records, smartphones and other devices and access to ever greater computational power provides not only new opportunities, but also new challenges. Artificial intelligence (AI) exemplifies the potential of this digital revolution, which also includes other tools such as mobile health (mHealth) services and wearables. Despite digital technology becoming commonplace, its use in medicine and medical research is still in its infancy, with many clinicians and researchers having limited experience with such tools in their usual practice. This article, derived from the 'Digital Health and Artificial Intelligence' session of the Kidney Disease Clinical Trialists virtual workshop held in September 2020, aims to illustrate the breadth of applications to which digital tools and AI can be applied in clinical medicine and research. It highlights several innovative projects incorporating digital technology that range from streamlining medical care of those with acute kidney injury to the use of AI to navigate the vast genomic and proteomic data gathered in kidney disease. Important considerations relating to any new digital health project are presented, with a view to encouraging the further evolution and refinement of these new tools in a manner that fosters collaboration and the generation of robust evidence.", "Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) for colonoscopy with use of artificial intelligence (AI) is catching increased attention of endoscopists. CAD allows automated detection and pathological prediction, namely optical biopsy, of colorectal polyps during real-time endoscopy, which help endoscopists avoid missing and/or misdiagnosing colorectal lesions. With the increased number of publications in this field and emergence of the AI medical device that have already secured regulatory approval, CAD in colonoscopy is now being implemented into clinical practice. On the other side, drawbacks and weak points of CAD in colonoscopy have not been thoroughly discussed. In this review, we provide an overview of CAD for optical biopsy of colorectal lesions with a particular focus on its clinical applications and limitations.", "Artificial intelligence and edge devices have been used at an increased rate in managing the COVID-19 pandemic. In this article we review the lessons learned from COVID-19 to postulate possible solutions for a Disease X event. The overall purpose of the study and the research problems investigated is the integration of artificial intelligence\u00a0function in digital healthcare systems. The basic design of the study includes a systematic state-of-the-art review, followed by an evaluation of different approaches to managing global pandemics. The study design then engages with constructing a new methodology for integrating algorithms in healthcare systems, followed by analysis of the new methodology and a discussion. Action research is applied to review existing state of the art, and a qualitative case study method is used to analyse the knowledge acquired from the COVID-19 pandemic. Major trends found as a result of the study derive from the synthesis of COVID-19 knowledge, presenting new insights in the form of a conceptual methodology-that includes six phases for managing a future Disease X event, resulting with a summary map of various problems, solutions and expected results from integrating functional AI in healthcare systems.", "The application of artificial intelligence (AI) may revolutionize the healthcare system, leading to enhance efficiency by automatizing routine tasks and decreasing health-related costs, broadening access to healthcare delivery, targeting more precisely patient needs, and assisting clinicians in their decision-making. For these benefits to materialize, governments and health authorities must regulate AI, and conduct appropriate health technology assessment (HTA). Many authors have highlighted that AI health technologies (AIHT) challenge traditional evaluation and regulatory processes. To inform and support HTA organizations and regulators in adapting their processes to AIHTs, we conducted a systematic review of the literature on the challenges posed by AIHTs in HTA and health regulation. Our research question was: What makes artificial intelligence exceptional in HTA? The current body of literature appears to portray AIHTs as being exceptional to HTA. This exceptionalism is expressed along 5 dimensions: 1) AIHT's distinctive features; 2) their systemic impacts on health care and the health sector; 3) the increased expectations towards AI in health; 4) the new ethical, social and legal challenges that arise from deploying AI in the health sector; and 5) the new evaluative constraints that AI poses to HTA. Thus, AIHTs are perceived as exceptional because of their technological characteristics and potential impacts on society at large. As AI implementation by governments and health organizations carries risks of generating new, and amplifying existing, challenges, there are strong arguments for taking into consideration the exceptional aspects of AIHTs, especially as their impacts on the healthcare system will be far greater than that of drugs and medical devices. As AIHTs begin to be increasingly introduced into the health care sector, there is a window of opportunity for HTA agencies and scholars to consider AIHTs' exceptionalism and to work towards only deploying clinically, economically, socially acceptable AIHTs in the health care system.", "AI Ethics is a burgeoning and relatively new field that has emerged in response to growing concerns about the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on human individuals and their social institutions. In turn, AI ethics is a part of the broader field of digital ethics, which addresses similar concerns generated by the development and deployment of new digital technologies. Here, we tackle the important worry that digital ethics in general, and AI ethics in particular, lack adequate philosophical foundations. In direct response to that worry, we formulate and rationally justify some basic concepts and principles for digital ethics/AI ethics, all drawn from a broadly Kantian theory of human dignity. Our argument, which is designed to be relatively compact and easily accessible, is presented in ten distinct steps: (1) what \"digital ethics\" and \"AI ethics\" mean, (2) refuting the dignity-skeptic, (3) the metaphysics of human dignity, (4) human happiness or flourishing, true human needs, and human dignity, (5) our moral obligations with respect to all human real persons, (6) what a natural automaton or natural machine is, (7) why human real persons are not natural automata/natural machines: because consciousness is a form of life, (8) our moral obligations with respect to the design and use of artificial automata or artificial machines, aka computers, and digital technology more generally, (9) what privacy is, why invasions of digital privacy are morally impermissible, whereas consensual entrances into digital privacy are either morally permissible or even obligatory, and finally (10) dignitarian morality versus legality, and digital ethics/AI ethics. We conclude by asserting our strongly-held belief that a well-founded and generally-accepted dignitarian digital ethics/AI ethics is of global existential importance for humanity.", "Benign tumors of the eyelids are manifold. They can severely impair the anatomical unit of upper and lower eyelid, which basically serves to protect the eyeball. Furthermore, they can induce reduction of visual acuity or cause a subjectively more or less strong aesthetic disturbance of appearance. Patients may visit the ophthalmologist by themselves or referred by a dermatologist or a general practitioner. Therefore, knowledge of the clinical signs and symptoms of benign tumors are mandatory to discriminate against malign tumors or to identify possible associated disease. In this article, the incidence, clinic, risk factors, symptomatology, histopathologic features, and probabilities of malignant transformation and recurrence of the most common benign eyelid tumors are presented. Objective of this article is to illustrate when to do further work-up to rule out systemic disease and when to do biopsy to rule out malignancy. Finally, the publication is giving an outlook on the use of artificial intelligence to diagnose lid tumors in the future.", "Adverse childhood experiences (ACE) are associated with an increased risk for dementia, but this relationship and modifying factors are poorly understood. This study is the first to our knowledge to comprehensively examine the effect of ACE on specific cognitive functions and measures associated with greater risk and resiliency to cognitive decline in independent community-dwelling older adults.\nVerbal/nonverbal intelligence, verbal memory, visual memory, and executive attention were assessed. Self-report measures examined depression, self-efficacy, and subjective cognitive concerns (SCC). The ACE questionnaire measured childhood experiences of abuse, neglect, and household dysfunction.\nOver 56% of older adults reported an adverse childhood event. ACE scores were negatively associated with income and years of education and positively associated with depressive symptoms and SCC. ACE scores were a significant predictor of intellectual function and executive attention; however, these relationships were no longer significant after adjusting for education. Follow-up analyses using the PROCESS macro revealed that relationships among higher ACE scores with intellectual function and executive attention were mediated by education.\nGreater childhood adversity may increase vulnerability for cognitive impairment by impacting early education, socioeconomic status, and mental health. These findings have clinical implications for enhancing levels of cognitive reserve and addressing modifiable risk factors to prevent or attenuate cognitive decline in older adults.", "Metastatic Prostate Cancer (mPCa) is associated with a poor patient prognosis. mPCa spreads throughout the body, often to bones, with spatial and temporal variations that make the clinical management of the disease difficult. The evolution of the disease leads to spatial heterogeneity that is extremely difficult to characterise with solid biopsies. Imaging provides the opportunity to quantify disease spread. Advanced image analytics methods, including radiomics, offer the opportunity to characterise heterogeneity beyond what can be achieved with simple assessment. Radiomics analysis has the potential to yield useful quantitative imaging biomarkers that can improve the early detection of mPCa, predict disease progression, assess response, and potentially inform the choice of treatment procedures. Traditional radiomics analysis involves modelling with hand-crafted features designed using significant domain knowledge. On the other hand, artificial intelligence techniques such as deep learning can facilitate end-to-end automated feature extraction and model generation with minimal human intervention. Radiomics models have the potential to become vital pieces in the oncology workflow, however, the current limitations of the field, such as limited reproducibility, are impeding their translation into clinical practice. This review provides an overview of the radiomics methodology, detailing critical aspects affecting the reproducibility of features, and providing examples of how artificial intelligence techniques can be incorporated into the workflow. The current landscape of publications utilising radiomics methods in the assessment and treatment of mPCa are surveyed and reviewed. Associated studies have incorporated information from multiple imaging modalities, including bone scintigraphy, CT, PET with varying tracers, multiparametric MRI together with clinical covariates, spanning the prediction of progression through to overall survival in varying cohorts. The methodological quality of each study is quantified using the radiomics quality score. Multiple deficits were identified, with the lack of prospective design and external validation highlighted as major impediments to clinical translation. These results inform some recommendations for future directions of the field.", "Lateral temporal lobe epilepsies (LTLE) are poorly characterized heterogeneous epilepsies. As the lateral temporal lobe supports distinct functions, we hypothesized that neuropsychological profiles could differ according to the localization of the seizure focus within the lateral temporal lobe.\nWe retrospectively examined the neuropsychological characteristics of 74 consecutive patients with refractory LTLE assessed in the context of a presurgical investigation at the Piti\u00e9-Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re Hospital in Paris between 1998 and 2018. Precise localization of the epileptic focus was correlated with scores on tests of intelligence (Global, Verbal and Performance IQ), working memory, episodic memory (verbal and visual learning and forgetting), executive functions, and language abilities.\nWe demonstrated an impact of the localization of the epileptic focus within the lateral temporal lobe with worse learning and/or executive performances depicted in the infero-basal and pure pole LTLE groups and greater language difficulties in the posterior LTLE group, Antiepileptic drugs had a greater effect than parameters related to the epilepsy itself as the lesion or the disease duration, and finally as in medial TLE, the age, education, and sex influenced some cognitive performances.\nOur findings show that the lateral temporal neocortex is also part of the neural substrate for memory processing and executive functions and suggest that this involvement could be related to functions devoted to specific subregions of the temporal lobe (i.e., temporal pole, inferior and basal regions) that support language and semantic processing.", "Background and study aims \u2002The aim of this study was to introduce EndoConf, a reliable and easy-to-use tool capable of optimizing clinical care in endoscopy by reducing the number of repeat endoscopy procedures, providing continuous on-the-job clinical education, and allowing a smooth transition to the next level of artificial intelligence-supported systems. Patients and methods \u2002We prospectively developed and improved a real-time conference system (EndoConf). EndoConf enables endoscopists to contact on-demand and in real time experienced endoscopists across other sites. After the initial introduction period, we registered all EndoConf-assisted procedures from our unit (Surgical Department of Odense University Hospital) over a 3-month period (Autumn of 2019). Results\u2002 Of 84 EndoConf-supported procedures, 58 were eligible for further analysis. Eventually, 38 calls were made, of which only four were technically of low quality (10.5\u200a%) while three were not answered (7.9\u200a%). Of the 35 (92.1\u200a%) completed EndoConf calls; 24 were referred for endoscopic mucosal resection, six were referred for transanal microsurgery preceded by transrectal ultrasonography and three were referred for multidisciplinary conference, whereas in two cases, the lesion was resected during EndoConf. Conclusions \u2002We found the EndoConf system to provide support that could reduce the number of unnecessary repeat endoscopic procedures while at the same time ensuring avoidance of any hazardous attempt at polypectomy.", "With the rise of artificial intelligence, deep learning has become the main research method of pedestrian recognition re-identification (re-id). However, most of the existing researches usually just determine the retrieval order based on the geographical location of cameras, which ignore the spatio-temporal logic characteristics of pedestrian flow. Furthermore, most of these methods rely on common object detection to detect and match pedestrians directly, which will separate the logical connection between videos from different cameras. In this research, a novel pedestrian re-identification model assisted by logical topological inference is proposed, which includes: 1) a joint optimization mechanism of pedestrian re-identification and multicamera logical topology inference, which makes the multicamera logical topology provides the retrieval order and the confidence for re-identification. And meanwhile, the results of pedestrian re-identification as a feedback modify logical topological inference; 2) a dynamic spatio-temporal information driving logical topology inference method via conditional probability graph convolution network (CPGCN) with random forest-based transition activation mechanism (RF-TAM) is proposed, which focuses on the pedestrian's walking direction at different moments; and 3) a pedestrian group cluster graph convolution network (GC-GCN) is designed to measure the correlation between embedded pedestrian features. Some experimental analyses and real scene experiments on datasets CUHK-SYSU, PRW, SLP, and UJS-reID indicate that the designed model can achieve a better logical topology inference with an accuracy of 87.3% and achieve the top-1 accuracy of 77.4% and the mAP accuracy of 74.3% for pedestrian re-identification.", "As medicine and the delivery of healthcare enters the age of Artificial Intelligence (AI), the need for competent human-machine interaction to aid clinical decisions will rise. Medical students need to be sufficiently proficient in AI, its advantages to improve healthcare's expenses, quality, and access. Similarly, students must be educated about the shortfalls of AI such as bias, transparency, and liability. Overlooking a technology that will be transformative for the foreseeable future would place medical students at a disadvantage. However, there has been little interest in researching a proper method to implement AI in the medical education curriculum. This study aims to review the current literature that covers the attitudes of medical students towards AI, implementation of AI in the medical curriculum, and describe the need for more research in this area.\nAn integrative review was performed to combine data from various research designs and literature. Pubmed, Medline (Ovid), GoogleScholar, and Web of Science articles between 2010 and 2020 were all searched with particular inclusion and exclusion criteria. Full text of the selected articles was analyzed using the Extension of Technology Acceptance Model and the Diffusions of Innovations theory. Data were successively pooled together, recorded, and analyzed quantitatively using a modified Hawkings evaluation form. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses was utilized to help improve reporting.\nA total of 39 articles meeting inclusion criteria were identified. Primary assessments of medical students attitudes were identified (n\u2009=\u20095). Plans to implement AI in the curriculum for the purpose of teaching students about AI (n\u2009=\u20096) and articles reporting actual implemented changes (n\u2009=\u20092) were assessed. Finally, 26 articles described the need for more research on this topic or calling for the need of change in medical curriculum to anticipate AI in healthcare.\nThere are few plans or implementations reported on how to incorporate AI in the medical curriculum. Medical schools must work together to create a longitudinal study and initiative on how to successfully equip medical students with knowledge in AI.", "This study aimed to develop an efficient and easily calculable risk score that can be used to identify an individual's risk of having been exposed to alcohol prenatally.\nData for this study were collected as part of the Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders, Phases 2 and 3. Two cohorts (ages 5 to 17\u00a0years) completed a comprehensive neurobehavioral battery and a standard dysmorphology exam: a development cohort (DC; n\u00a0=\u00a0325) and a comparative cohort (CC; n\u00a0=\u00a0523). Both cohorts included two groups: those with histories of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure (AE-DC, n\u00a0=\u00a0121; AE-CC, n\u00a0=\u00a0177) and a control group that included subjects with minimal or no prenatal alcohol exposure (CON-DC, n\u00a0=\u00a0204; CON-CC, n\u00a0=\u00a0346). Behavioral assessments and physical exam data were combined using regression techniques to derive a risk score indicating the likelihood of prenatal alcohol exposure. Subjects were then divided into two subgroups: (1) low risk and (2) high risk. Chi-square (\u03c72 ) determined classification accuracy and ROC curves were produced to assess the predictive accuracy. Correlations between risk scores and intelligence quotient and executive function scores were calculated.\nSubjects were accurately classified in the DC (\u03c72 \u00a0=\u00a078.61, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and CC (\u03c72 \u00a0=\u00a086.63, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). The classification model also performed well in the DC (ROC\u00a0=\u00a00.835 [SE\u00a0=\u00a00.024, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001]) and CC (ROC\u00a0=\u00a00.786 [SE\u00a0=\u00a00.021, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001]). In the AE-CC and CON-CC, there were modest but significant associations between the risk score and executive function (AE-CC: r\u00a0=\u00a0-0.20, p\u00a0=\u00a00.034; CON-CC: r\u00a0=\u00a0-0.28, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and intelligence quotient (AE-CC: r\u00a0=\u00a0-0.20, p\u00a0=\u00a00.034; CON-CC: r\u00a0=\u00a0-0.28, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001).\nThe risk score significantly distinguished alcohol-exposed from control subjects and correlated with important cognitive outcomes. It has significant clinical potential and could be easily deployed in clinical settings.", "Our paper highlights the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in oesophageal and gastric malignancies with acceptable levels of accuracy for both diagnostic and surveillance purposes. Here, we comment on the past, present and future work necessary for incorporating AI into the clinical framework and practice.", "This study examined the associations of vocabulary and phonological and orthographic awareness with Hangul word reading in Korean children, aged between 7 and 10\u00a0years, who were deaf and hard of hearing (DHH) and children with typical hearing (TH). The participants were 24 children with hearing aids (HAs), 24 children with cochlear implants (CIs), and 24 TH children in Korea. The three groups were matched for chronological age, vocabulary age, and nonverbal intelligence. Results showed that there were no differences between children with CIs and those with HAs in reading fluency and cognitive skills, except word-reading accuracy, whereas children with CIs and HAs were delayed in all measures compared with their TH peers. Regression analyses showed that syllable and phoneme awareness uniquely explained word-reading accuracy in children with DHH and those with TH. However, word-reading fluency was uniquely explained by syllable awareness in the DHH children and by vocabulary and orthographic awareness in the TH children. These results suggest that DHH and TH children in Korea rely on phonological awareness for Korean word recognition. However, DHH and TH Korean children tend to use different strategies based on sublexical versus lexical information, respectively, to read Korean words fluently.", "The current increase in the number of publications on the use of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies in neurosurgery indicates a new trend in clinical neuroscience. The aim of the study was to conduct a systematic literature review to highlight the main directions and trends in the use of AI in neurosurgery.\nUsing the PubMed search engine, 327 original journal articles published from 1996 to July 2019 and related to the use of AI technologies in neurosurgery, were selected. The typical issues addressed by using AI were identified for each area of neurosurgery.\nThe typical AI applications within each of the five main areas of neurosurgery (neuro-oncology, functional, vascular, spinal neurosurgery, and traumatic brain injury) were defined.\nThe article highlights the main areas and trends in the up-to-date AI research in neurosurgery, which might be helpful in planning new scientific projects.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) is a field of study that combines the applications of machine learning, algorithm productions, and natural language processing. Applications of AI transform the tools of education. AI has a variety of educational applications, such as personalized learning platforms to promote students' learning, automated assessment systems to aid teachers, and facial recognition systems to generate insights about learners' behaviors. Despite the potential benefits of AI to support students' learning experiences and teachers' practices, the ethical and societal drawbacks of these systems are rarely fully considered in K-12 educational contexts. The ethical challenges of AI in education must be identified and introduced to teachers and students. To address these issues, this paper (1) briefly defines AI through the concepts of machine learning and algorithms; (2) introduces applications of AI in educational settings and benefits of AI systems to support students' learning processes; (3) describes ethical challenges and dilemmas of using AI in education; and (4) addresses the teaching and understanding of AI by providing recommended instructional resources from two providers-i.e., the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's (MIT) Media Lab and Code.org. The article aims to help practitioners reap the benefits and navigate ethical challenges of integrating AI in K-12 classrooms, while also introducing instructional resources that\u00a0teachers can use to advance K-12 students' understanding of AI and ethics.", "With the application of Internet of Things, big data, cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and other cutting-edge technologies, China's medical informatization is developing rapidly. In this paper, we summaried the role of information technology in healthcare sector's battle against the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) from the perspectives of early warning and monitoring, screening and diagnosis, medical treatment and scientific research, analyzes the bottlenecks of the development of information technology in the post-COVID-19 era, and puts forward feasible suggestions for further promoting the construction of medical informatization from the perspectives of sharing, convenience, and safety.", "Background and study aims\u2002 Colonoscopy completion reduces post-colonoscopy colorectal cancer. As a result, there have been attempts at implementing artificial intelligence to automate the detection of the appendiceal orifice (AO) for quality assurance. However, the utilization of these algorithms has not been demonstrated in suboptimal conditions, including variable bowel preparation. We present an automated computer-assisted method using a deep convolutional neural network to detect the AO irrespective of bowel preparation. Methods\u2002 A total of 13,222 images (6,663 AO and 1,322 non-AO) were extracted from 35 colonoscopy videos recorded between 2015 and 2018.\u200aThe images were labelled with Boston Bowel Preparation Scale scores. A total of 11,900 images were used for training/validation and 1,322 for testing. We developed a convolutional neural network (CNN) with a DenseNet architecture pre-trained on ImageNet as a feature extractor on our data and trained a classifier uniquely tailored for identification of AO and non-AO images using binary cross entropy loss. Results\u2002 The deep convolutional neural network was able to correctly classify the AO and non-AO images with an accuracy of 94\u200a%. The area under the receiver operating curve of this neural network was 0.98.\u200aThe sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of the algorithm were 0.96, 0.92, 0.92 and 0.96, respectively. AO detection was >\u200a95\u200a% regardless of BBPS scores, while non-AO detection improved from BBPS 1 score (83.95\u200a%) to BBPS 3 score (98.28\u200a%). Conclusions \u2002A deep convolutional neural network was created demonstrating excellent discrimination between AO from non-AO images despite variable bowel preparation. This algorithm will require further testing to ascertain its effectiveness in real-time colonoscopy.", "Due to the increase in the number of patients who died as a result of the SARS-CoV-2 virus around the world, researchers are working tirelessly to find technological solutions to help doctors in their daily work. Fast and accurate Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques are needed to assist doctors in their decisions to predict the severity and mortality risk of a patient. Early prediction of patient severity would help in saving hospital resources and decrease the continual death of patients by providing early medication actions. Currently, X-ray images are used as early symptoms in detecting COVID-19 patients. Therefore, in this research, a prediction model has been built to predict different levels of severity risks for the COVID-19 patient based on X-ray images by applying machine learning techniques. To build the proposed model, CheXNet deep pre-trained model and hybrid handcrafted techniques were applied to extract features, two different methods: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) were integrated to select the most important features, and then, six machine learning techniques were applied. For handcrafted features, the experiments proved that merging the features that have been selected by PCA and RFE together (PCA + RFE) achieved the best results with all classifiers compared with using all features or using the features selected by PCA or RFE individually. The XGBoost classifier achieved the best performance with the merged (PCA + RFE) features, where it accomplished 97% accuracy, 98% precision, 95% recall, 96% f1-score and 100% roc-auc. Also, SVM carried out the same results with some minor differences, but overall it was a good performance where it accomplished 97% accuracy, 96% precision, 95% recall, 95% f1-score and 99% roc-auc. On the other hand, for pre-trained CheXNet features, Extra Tree and SVM classifiers with RFE achieved 99.6% for all measures.", "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is one of the most common cardiac arrhythmias. Implantable and wearable cardiac devices have enabled the detection of asymptomatic AF episodes-termed subclinical AF (SCAF). SCAF, the prevalence of which is likely significantly underestimated, is associated with increased cardiovascular and all-cause mortality and a significant stroke risk. Recent advances in machine learning, namely artificial intelligence-enabled ECG (AI-ECG), have enabled identification of patients at higher likelihood of SCAF. Leveraging the capabilities of AI-ECG algorithms to drive screening protocols could eventually allow for earlier detection and treatment and help reduce the burden associated with AF.", "Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors are becoming an essential drug in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus; however, some classes of these drugs exert side effects, including joint pain and pancreatitis. Studies suggest that these side effects might be related to secondary inhibition of DPP-8 and DPP-9. In this study, we identified DPP-4-inhibitor hit compounds selective against DPP-8 and DPP-9. We built a virtual screening workflow using a quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) strategy based on artificial intelligence to allow faster screening of millions of molecules for the DPP-4 target relative to other screening methods. Five regression machine learning algorithms and four classification machine learning algorithms were applied to build virtual screening workflows, with the QSAR model applied using support vector regression (R2pred 0.78) and the classification QSAR model using the random forest algorithm with 92.2% accuracy. Virtual screening results of >\u00a010 million molecules obtained 2 716 hits compounds with a pIC50 value of >\u00a07.5. Additionally, molecular docking results of several potential hit compounds for DPP-4, DPP-8, and DPP-9 identified CH0002 as showing high inhibitory potential against DPP-4 and low inhibitory potential for DPP-8 and DPP-9 enzymes. These results demonstrated the effectiveness of this technique for identifying DPP-4-inhibitor hit compounds selective for DPP-4 and against DPP-8 and DPP-9 and suggest its potential efficacy for applications to discover hit compounds of other targets.", "Contemporary discourse on Artificial Intelligence (AI) in medicine is oft-sensationalised to the point of bearing no resemblance to its everyday impact and potential - either to proselytise it as a saviour or to condemn its perilous, amoral and sprawling reach.This report aims to unravel the paucity of understanding underpinning this hyperbolic duality, whilst addressing the potential clearly defining its ethical use poses to the semi-public healthcare models in Ireland and Europe.\nThe report contrasts the challenge of regulating the breakneck development of AI, with healthcare's necessity for stringent quality control in ethical technological development to ensure patients' well-being.Physical, practical and philosophical approaches to Artificial Intelligence in medicine are explored through Beauchamp and Childress' principles of delivering care with beneficence, non maleficence, justice and autonomy. AI is scrutinised under Kantian deontological, Benthamite utilitarian and Rawlsian perspectives on health justice. Actor Network theory is used to explain sociotechnical interactions governing human stakeholders developing ethical AI.These analyses operate firstly to define AI concisely, then ground it in its contemporary and future functions in healthcare. They highlight the importance of aligning medical AI with accepted ethical standards as a necessity of its integrated use across healthcare.\nThis report concludes that balanced assessment of AI's role in healthcare requires improvement in three areas: improving clarity in definition of AI and its extant remit in medicine; aligning contemporary discourse on AI use with contemporary objective ethical, legal and system frameworks; and clearly identifying for dismissal a number of logical fallacies deliberately sensationalising AI's potential.", "Colorectal polyps are common, and their histopathologic classification is used in the planning of follow-up surveillance. Substantial variation has been observed in pathologists' classification of colorectal polyps, and improved assessment by pathologists may be associated with reduced subsequent underuse and overuse of colonoscopy.\nTo compare standard microscopic assessment with an artificial intelligence (AI)-augmented digital system that annotates regions of interest within digitized polyp tissue and predicts polyp type using a deep learning model to assist pathologists in colorectal polyp classification.\nIn this diagnostic study conducted at a tertiary academic medical center and a community hospital in New Hampshire, 100 slides with colorectal polyp samples were read by 15 pathologists using a microscope and an AI-augmented digital system, with a washout period of at least 12 weeks between use of each modality. The study was conducted from February 10 to July 10, 2020.\nAccuracy and time of evaluation were used to compare pathologists' performance when a microscope was used with their performance when the AI-augmented digital system was used. Outcomes were compared using paired t tests and mixed-effects models.\nIn assessments of 100 slides with colorectal polyp specimens, use of the AI-augmented digital system significantly improved pathologists' classification accuracy compared with microscopic assessment from 73.9% (95% CI, 71.7%-76.2%) to 80.8% (95% CI, 78.8%-82.8%) (P\u2009<\u2009.001). The overall difference in the evaluation time per slide between the digital system (mean, 21.7 seconds; 95% CI, 20.8-22.7 seconds) and microscopic examination (mean, 13.0 seconds; 95% CI, 12.4-13.5 seconds) was -8.8 seconds (95% CI, -9.8 to -7.7 seconds), but this difference decreased as pathologists became more familiar and experienced with the digital system; the difference between the time of evaluation on the last set of 20 slides for all pathologists when using the microscope and the digital system was 4.8 seconds (95% CI, 3.0-6.5 seconds).\nIn this diagnostic study, an AI-augmented digital system significantly improved the accuracy of pathologic interpretation of colorectal polyps compared with microscopic assessment. If applied broadly to clinical practice, this tool may be associated with decreases in subsequent overuse and underuse of colonoscopy and thus with improved patient outcomes and reduced health care costs.", "It is evident in the literature that both intellectual capital and big data analytics create value to the organizations independently, but how threats, opportunities, capabilities and value creation for intellectual capital change with big data adoption is largely unexplored. This paper aims to develop an analytical framework for identifying challenges, opportunities, capabilities and value creation in the face of complementarity between big data and components of intellectual capital. The paper uses a Collective Intelligence approach as a theoretical background. Based on Structured Literature Review, the current study has developed an analytical framework for organizations to be used as a decision-making tool while making investment in big data and managing intellectual capital. Findings suggest that the scope of human capital has changed largely as now employees are expected much more than in the past with strong analytical, dynamic, technical and IT capabilities. Structural capital calls for new practices, routines and procedures to be adopted and old methods to unlearn whereas relational capital stresses the importance of network building and social media to create sustainable value for the society.", "Pandemic events, particularly the current Covid-19 disease, compel organisations to re-formulate their day-to-day operations for achieving various business goals such as cost reduction. Unfortunately, small and medium enterprises (SMEs) making up more than 95% of all businesses is the hardest hit sector. This has urged SMEs to rethink their operations to survive through pandemic events. One key area is the use of new technologies pertaining to digital transformation for optimizing pandemic preparedness and minimizing business disruptions. This is especially true from the perspective of digitizing asset management methodologies in the era of Industry 4.0 under pandemic environments. Incidentally, human-centric approaches have become increasingly important in predictive maintenance through the exploitation of digital tools, especially when the workforce is increasingly interacting with new technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Internet-of-Things devices for condition monitoring in equipment maintenance services. In this research, we propose an AI-based human-centric decision support framework for predictive maintenance in asset management, which can facilitate prompt and informed decision-making under pandemic environments. For predictive maintenance of complex systems, an enhanced trust-based ensemble model is introduced to undertake imbalanced data issues. A human-in-the-loop mechanism is incorporated to exploit the tacit knowledge elucidated from subject matter experts for providing decision support. Evaluations with both benchmark and real-world databases demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework for addressing imbalanced data issues in predictive maintenance tasks. In the real-world case study, an accuracy rate of 82% is achieved, which indicates the potential of the proposed framework in assisting business sustainability pertaining to asset predictive maintenance under pandemic environments.", "The study evaluates the relationship of coronary stenosis, atherosclerotic plaque characteristics (APCs) and age using artificial intelligence enabled quantitative coronary computed tomographic angiography (AI-QCT).\nThis is a post-hoc analysis of data from 303 subjects enrolled in the CREDENCE (Computed TomogRaphic Evaluation of Atherosclerotic Determinants of Myocardial IsChEmia) trial who were referred for invasive coronary angiography and subsequently underwent coronary computed tomographic angiography (CCTA). In this study, a blinded core laboratory analysing quantitative coronary angiography images classified lesions as obstructive (\u226550%) or non-obstructive (<50%) while AI software quantified APCs including plaque volume (PV), low-density non-calcified plaque (LD-NCP), non-calcified plaque (NCP), calcified plaque (CP), lesion length on a per-patient and per-lesion basis based on CCTA imaging. Plaque measurements were normalised for vessel volume and reported as % percent atheroma volume (%PAV) for all relevant plaque components. Data were subsequently stratified by age <65 and \u226565 years.\nThe cohort was 64.4\u00b110.2 years and 29% women. Overall, patients >65 had more PV and CP than patients <65. On a lesion level, patients >65 had more CP than younger patients in both obstructive (29.2 mm3 vs 48.2 mm3; p<0.04) and non-obstructive lesions (22.1 mm3 vs 49.4 mm3; p<0.004) while younger patients had more %PAV (LD-NCP) (1.5% vs 0.7%; p<0.038). Younger patients had more PV, LD-NCP, NCP and lesion lengths in obstructive compared with non-obstructive lesions. There were no differences observed between lesion types in older patients.\nAI-QCT identifies a unique APC signature that differs by age and degree of stenosis and provides a foundation for AI-guided age-based approaches to atherosclerosis identification, prevention and treatment.", "Deep Learning shows promising performance in diverse fields and has become an emerging technology in Artificial Intelligence. Recent visual recognition is based on the ranking of photographs and the finding of artefacts in those images. The aim of this research is to classify the different cough sounds of COVID-19 artefacts in the signals of altered real-life environments. The introduced model takes into consideration two major steps. The first step is the transformation phase from sound to image that is optimized by the scalogram technique. The second step involves feature extraction and classification based on six deep transfer models (GoogleNet, ResNet18, ResNet50, ResNet101, MobileNetv2, and NasNetmobile). The dataset used contains 1457 (755 of COVID-19 and 702 of healthy) wave cough sounds. Although our recognition model performs the best, its accuracy only reaches 94.9% based on SGDM optimizer. The accuracy is promising enough for a wide set of labeled cough data to test the potential for generalization. The outcomes show that ResNet18 is the most stable model to classify the cough sounds from a limited dataset with a sensitivity of 94.44% and a specificity of 95.37%. Finally, a comparison of the research with a similar analysis is made. It is observed that the proposed model is more reliable and accurate than any current models. Cough research precision is promising enough to test the ability for extrapolation and generalization.", "Clinically significant portal hypertension is associated with an increased risk of developing gastroesophageal varices and hepatic decompensation. Hepatic venous pressure gradient measurement and esophagogastroduodenoscopy are the gold-standard methods for assessing clinically significant portal hypertension and gastroesophageal varices, respectively. However, invasiveness, cost, and feasibility limit their widespread use, especially if repeated and serial evaluations are required to assess the efficacy of pharmacotherapy. Artificial intelligence describes a range of techniques that allow machines to perform tasks typically thought to require human reasoning and problem-solving skills. Artificial intelligence has made great strides in the field of medicine, and is also involved in portal hypertension diagnosis. Artificial intelligence tools will potentially transform our practice by leveraging massive amounts of data to personalize care to the right patient, in the right amount, at the right time. This review focuses on the recent advances in artificial intelligence for the noninvasive diagnosis of portal hypertension and gastroesophageal varices and monitoring of risk assessment of its complications in clinical practice.", "Coughing is a common symptom of several respiratory diseases. The sound and type of cough are useful features to consider when diagnosing a disease. Respiratory infections pose a significant risk to human lives worldwide as well as a significant economic downturn, particularly in countries with limited therapeutic resources. In this study we reviewed the latest proposed technologies that were used to control the impact of respiratory diseases. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a promising technology that aids in data analysis and prediction of results, thereby ensuring people's well-being. We conveyed that the cough symptom can be reliably used by AI algorithms to detect and diagnose different types of known diseases including pneumonia, pulmonary edema, asthma, tuberculosis (TB), COVID19, pertussis, and other respiratory diseases. We also identified different techniques that produced the best results for diagnosing respiratory disease using cough samples. This study presents the most recent challenges, solutions, and opportunities in respiratory disease detection and diagnosis, allowing practitioners and researchers to develop better techniques.", "Wearable E-textile systems should be comfortable so that highest efficiency of their functionality can be achieved. The development of electronic textiles (functional textiles) as a wearable technology for various applications has intensified the use of flexible wearable functional textiles instead of wearable electronics. However, the wearable functional textiles still bring comfort complications during wear. The purpose of this review paper is to sightsee and recap recent developments in the field of functional textile comfort evaluation systems. For textile-based materials which have close contact to the skin, clothing comfort is a fundamental necessity. In this paper, the effects of functional finishing on the comfort of the textile material were reviewed. A brief review of clothing comfort evaluations for textile fabrics based on subjective and objective techniques was conducted. The reasons behind the necessity for sensory evaluation for smart and functional clothing have been presented. The existing works of literature on comfort evaluation techniques applied to functional fabrics have been reviewed. Statistical and soft computing/artificial intelligence presentations from selected fabric comfort studies were also reviewed. Challenges of smart textiles and its future highlighted. Some experimental results were presented to support the review. From the aforementioned reviews, it is noted that the electronics clothing comfort evaluation of smart/functional fabrics needs more focus.", "Infectious keratitis (IK) represents the leading cause of corneal blindness worldwide, particularly in developing countries. A good outcome of IK is contingent upon timely and accurate diagnosis followed by appropriate interventions. Currently, IK is primarily diagnosed on clinical grounds supplemented by microbiological investigations such as microscopic examination with stains, and culture and sensitivity testing. Although this is the most widely accepted practice adopted in most regions, such an approach is challenged by several factors, including indistinguishable clinical features shared among different causative organisms, polymicrobial infection, long diagnostic turnaround time, and variably low culture positivity rate. In this review, we aim to provide a comprehensive overview of the current diagnostic armamentarium of IK, encompassing conventional microbiological investigations, molecular diagnostics (including polymerase chain reaction and mass spectrometry), and imaging modalities (including anterior segment optical coherence tomography and in vivo confocal microscopy). We also highlight the potential roles of emerging technologies such as next-generation sequencing, artificial intelligence-assisted platforms. and tele-medicine in shaping the future diagnostic landscape of IK.", "Genomic medicine has made important strides over the past several decades, but as new insights and technologies emerge, the applications of genomics in medicine and planetary health continue to evolve and expand. An important grand challenge is harnessing and making sense of the genomic big data in ways that best serve public and planetary health. Because human health is inextricably intertwined with the health of planetary ecosystems and nonhuman animals, genomic medicine is in need of high throughput bioinformatics analyses to harness and integrate human and ecological multiomics big data. It is in this overarching context that artificial intelligence (AI), particularly machine learning and deep learning, offers enormous potentials to advance genomic medicine in a spirit of One Health. This expert review offers an analysis of the rapidly emerging role of AI in genomic medicine, including its current drivers, levers, opportunities, and challenges. The scope of AI applications in genomic medicine is broad, ranging from efficient and automated data analysis to drug repurposing and precision medicine, as with its challenges such as veracity of the big data that AI sorely depends on, social biases that the AI-driven algorithms can introduce, and how best to incorporate AI with human intelligence. The road ahead for AI in genomic medicine is complex and arduous and yet worthy of cautious optimism as we face future pandemics and ecological crises in the 21st century. Now is a good time to think about the role of AI in genomic medicine and planetary health.", "Ex vivo fluorescence confocal microscopy (FCM) is a developing tool providing rapid digital imaging of fresh tissue utilizing high-resolution optical sectioning that highly corresponds with conventional hmatoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained slides. A very little data on oral mucosa lesions exist currently. The present work aimed to create an image atlas of benign and malignant oral tissues and compare them to the corresponding histopathology. Furthermore, we aimed to evaluate the learning curve for confocal image interpretation. From 50 samples obtained from the oral mucosa, including oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), dysplasia, and healthy oral tissue, ex vivo FCM images and corresponding H&E slides were created and collected into a tissue atlas. Additionally, two experts were asked to analyze the images to assess the learning curve. Ex vivo FCM images revealed high comparability with histopathological images. Tissues including OSCC, dysplasia, and normal oral mucosa were implemented in the image atlas to provide the diagnostic fundament for pathologists and surgeons; the learning curve was short. Future studies on this topic will be advantageous for the development of artificial intelligence-based diagnostic approaches. The current work provides a novel set of data that are structured as an atlas of common pathologies of the mucosa to enhance the existing knowledge and material on confocal images.", "Accurate evaluation of the treatment result on X-ray images is a significant and challenging step in root canal therapy since the incorrect interpretation of the therapy results will hamper timely follow-up which is crucial to the patients' treatment outcome. Nowadays, the evaluation is performed in a manual manner, which is time-consuming, subjective, and error-prone. In this article, we aim to automate this process by leveraging the advances in computer vision and artificial intelligence, to provide an objective and accurate method for root canal therapy result assessment. A novel anatomy-guided multi-branch Transformer (AGMB-Transformer) network is proposed, which first extracts a set of anatomy features and then uses them to guide a multi-branch Transformer network for evaluation. Specifically, we design a polynomial curve fitting segmentation strategy with the help of landmark detection to extract the anatomy features. Moreover, a branch fusion module and a multi-branch structure including our progressive Transformer and Group Multi-Head Self-Attention (GMHSA) are designed to focus on both global and local features for an accurate diagnosis. To facilitate the research, we have collected a large-scale root canal therapy evaluation dataset with 245 root canal therapy X-ray images, and the experiment results show that our AGMB-Transformer can improve the diagnosis accuracy from 57.96% to 90.20% compared with the baseline network. The proposed AGMB-Transformer can achieve a highly accurate evaluation of root canal therapy. To our best knowledge, our work is the first to perform automatic root canal therapy evaluation and has important clinical value to reduce the workload of endodontists.", "Ultrasound (US) is widely used in the clinical diagnosis of thyroid nodules. Artificial intelligence-powered US is becoming an important issue in the research community. This study aimed to develop an improved deep learning model-based algorithm to classify benign and malignant thyroid nodules (TNs) using thyroid US images.\nIn total, 592 patients with 600 TNs were included in the internal training, validation, and testing data set; 187 patients with 200 TNs were recruited for the external test data set. We developed a Visual Geometry Group (VGG)-16T model, based on the VGG-16 architecture, but with additional batch normalization (BN) and dropout layers in addition to the fully connected layers. We conducted a 10-fold cross-validation to analyze the performance of the VGG-16T model using a data set of gray-scale US images from 5 different brands of US machines.\nFor the internal data set, the VGG-16T model had 87.43% sensitivity, 85.43% specificity, and 86.43% accuracy. For the external data set, the VGG-16T model achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.829 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.770-0.879], a radiologist with 15 years' working experience achieved an AUC of 0.705 (95% CI: 0.659-0.801), a radiologist with 10 years' experience achieved an AUC of 0.725 (95% CI: 0.653-0.797), and a radiologist with 5 years' experience achieved an AUC of 0.660 (95% CI: 0.584-0.736).\nThe VGG-16T model had high specificity, sensitivity, and accuracy in differentiating between malignant and benign TNs. Its diagnostic performance was superior to that of experienced radiologists. Thus, the proposed improved deep-learning model can assist radiologists to diagnose thyroid cancer.", "Diagnoses of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are typically made after toddlerhood by examining behavioural patterns. Earlier identification of ASD enables earlier intervention and better outcomes. Machine learning provides a data-driven approach of diagnosing autism at an earlier age. This review aims to summarize recent studies and technologies utilizing machine learning based strategies to screen infants and children under the age of 18 months for ASD, and identify gaps that can be addressed in the future. We reviewed nine studies based on our search criteria, which includes primary studies and technologies conducted within the last 10 years that examine children with ASD or at high risk of ASD with a mean age of less than 18 months old. The studies must use machine learning analysis of behavioural features of ASD as major methodology. A total of nine studies were reviewed, of which the sensitivity ranges from 60.7% to 95.6%, the specificity ranges from 50% to 100%, and the accuracy ranges from 60.9% to 97.7%. Factors that contribute to the inconsistent findings include the varied presentation of ASD among patients and study design differences. Previous studies have shown moderate accuracy, sensitivity and specificity in the differentiation of ASD and non-ASD individuals under the age of 18 months. The application of machine learning and artificial intelligence in the screening of ASD in infants is still in its infancy, as observed by the granularity of data available for review. As such, much work needs to be done before the aforementioned technologies can be applied into clinical practice to facilitate early screening of ASD.", "The so-called \"opacity\" of artificial intelligence (AI), the black box model, raises concerns about the increasing use in relevant and critical areas of our society such as health, assistance, autonomous driving, military technologies, the economy, finance, justice, insurance. The need to create models that make it possible to understand, trust and therefore govern the emerging generation of these systems is increasingly felt, while maintaining a high level of performance. This is why a new discipline is being developed, eXplainable AI (XAI), which can be defined as a set of tools and techniques used to make the operation of AI increasingly transparent and easy to understand.", "New herbicide modes of action (MOAs) are in great demand because of the burgeoning evolution of resistance of weeds to existing commercial herbicides. This need has been exacerbated by the almost complete lack of introduction of herbicides with new MOAs for almost 40\u2009years. There are many highly phytotoxic compounds with MOAs not represented by commercial herbicides, but neither these compounds nor structural analogues have been developed as herbicides for a variety of reasons. Natural products provide knowledge of many MOAs that are not being utilized by commercial herbicides. Other means of identifying new herbicide targets are discussed, including pharmaceutical target sites and metabolomic and proteomic information, as well as the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning to predict herbicidal compounds with new MOAs. Information about several newly discovered herbicidal compounds with new MOAs is summarized. The currently increased efforts of both established companies and start-up companies are likely to result in herbicides with new MOAs that can be used in herbicide resistance management within the next decade. \u00a9 2021 Society of Chemical Industry.", "Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) is useful for the differential diagnosis of subepithelial lesions (SELs); however, not all of them are easy to distinguish. Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are the commonest SELs, are considered potentially malignant, and differentiating them from benign SELs is important. Artificial intelligence (AI) using deep learning has developed remarkably in the medical field. This study aimed to investigate the efficacy of an AI system for classifying SELs on EUS images.\nEUS images of pathologically confirmed upper gastrointestinal SELs (GIST, leiomyoma, schwannoma, neuroendocrine tumor [NET], and ectopic pancreas) were collected from 12 hospitals. These images were divided into development and test datasets in the ratio of 4:1 using random sampling; the development dataset was divided into training and validation datasets. The same test dataset was diagnosed by two experts and two non-experts.\nA total of 16,110 images were collected from 631 cases for the development and test datasets. The accuracy of the AI system for the five-category classification (GIST, leiomyoma, schwannoma, NET, and ectopic pancreas) was 86.1%, which was significantly higher than that of all endoscopists. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of the AI system for differentiating GISTs from non-GISTs were 98.8%, 67.6%, and 89.3%, respectively. Its sensitivity and accuracy were significantly higher than those of all the endoscopists.\nThe AI system, classifying SELs, showed higher diagnostic performance than that of the experts and may assist in improving the diagnosis of SELs in clinical practice.", "Space information networks is network systems that can receive, transmit, and process spatial information lively. It uses satellites, stratosphere airships, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, and other platforms as the carrier. It supports high-dynamic, real-time broadband transmission of earth observations and ultra-long-distance, long-delay reliable transmission of deep space exploration. The deeper the network integration, the higher the system's security concerns and the more likely SINs will be controlled and destroyed in terms of cybersecurity. How to integrate new IT technologies such as artificial intelligence, digital twins, and blockchain to diverse application scenarios of SINs while maintaining SIN cybersecurity will be a long-term critical technical issue. This study is a review of the security issues for space information networks. First, this paper examines space information networks' security issues and figures out the relationship between the main security threats, services, and mechanisms. Then, this article selects secure routing and anomaly detection from many security technologies to conduct a detailed overview from two perspectives of traditional methods and artificial intelligence. Subsequently, this paper investigates anomaly detection schemes for spatial information networks and proposes a deep learning-based anomaly detection scheme. Finally, we suggest the potential research directions and opening problems of space information network security. Overall, this paper aims to give readers an overview of the newly emerging technologies in space information networks' security issues and provide inspiration for future exploration.", "The development of artificial intelligence (AI) has increased dramatically in the last 20 years, with clinical applications progressively being explored for most of the medical specialties. The field of gastroenterology and hepatology, substantially reliant on vast amounts of imaging studies, is not an exception. The clinical applications of AI systems in this field include the identification of premalignant or malignant lesions (e.g., identification of dysplasia or esophageal adenocarcinoma in Barrett's esophagus, pancreatic malignancies), detection of lesions (e.g., polyp identification and classification, small-bowel bleeding lesion on capsule endoscopy, pancreatic cystic lesions), development of objective scoring systems for risk stratification, predicting disease prognosis or treatment response [e.g., determining survival in patients post-resection of hepatocellular carcinoma), determining which patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) will benefit from biologic therapy], or evaluation of metrics such as bowel preparation score or quality of endoscopic examination. The objective of this comprehensive review is to analyze the available AI-related studies pertaining to the entirety of the gastrointestinal tract, including the upper, middle and lower tracts; IBD; the hepatobiliary system; and the pancreas, discussing the findings and clinical applications, as well as outlining the current limitations and future directions in this field.", "Orbital telorism, the interocular distance, is clinically informative and in extremes is considered a minor physical anomaly. While its extremes, hypo- and hypertelorism, have been linked to disorders often related to cognitive ability, little is known about the neural correlates of normal variation of telorism within the general population. We derived measures of orbital telorism from cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) by calculating the distance between the eyeball center of gravity in two population-based datasets (N\u00a0=\u00a05,653, N\u00a0=\u00a029,824; mean age 64.66, 63.75 years). This measure was found to be related to grey matter tissue density within numerous regions of the brain, including, but surprisingly not limited to, the frontal regions, in both positive and negative directions. Additionally, telorism was related to several cognitive functions, such as Purdue pegboard test (Beta, P-value (CI95%) -.02, 1.63\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010-7 (-.03:-.01)) and fluid intelligence (.02, 4.75\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010-6 (.01:0.02)), with some relationships driven by individuals with a smaller orbital telorism. This is reflective of the higher prevalence of hypotelorism in developmental disorders, specifically those that accompany lower cognitive lower functioning. This study suggests, despite previous links only made in clinical extremes, that orbital telorism holds some relation to structural brain development and cognitive function in the general population. This relationship is likely driven by shared developmental periods.", "The rapid development of artificial intelligence technology has improved the capability of automatic breast cancer diagnosis, compared to traditional machine learning methods. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) can automatically select high efficiency features, which helps to improve the level of computer-aided diagnosis (CAD). It can improve the performance of distinguishing benign and malignant breast ultrasound (BUS) tumor images, making rapid breast tumor screening possible.\nThe classification model was evaluated with a different dataset of 100 BUS tumor images (50 benign cases and 50 malignant cases), which was not used in network training. Evaluation indicators include accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under curve (AUC) value. The results in the Fus2Net model had an accuracy of 92%, the sensitivity reached 95.65%, the specificity reached 88.89%, and the AUC value reached 0.97 for classifying BUS tumor images.\nThe experiment compared the existing CNN-categorized architecture, and the Fus2Net architecture we customed has more advantages in a comprehensive performance. The obtained results demonstrated that the Fus2Net classification method we proposed can better assist radiologists in the diagnosis of benign and malignant BUS tumor images.\nThe existing public datasets are small and the amount of data suffer from the balance issue. In this paper, we provide a relatively larger dataset with a total of 1052 ultrasound images, including 696 benign images and 356 malignant images, which were collected from a local hospital. We proposed a novel CNN named Fus2Net for the benign and malignant classification of BUS tumor images and it contains two self-designed feature extraction modules. To evaluate how the classifier generalizes on the experimental dataset, we employed the training set (646 benign cases and 306 malignant cases) for tenfold cross-validation. Meanwhile, to solve the balance of the dataset, the training data were augmented before being fed into the Fus2Net. In the experiment, we used hyperparameter fine-tuning and regularization technology to make the Fus2Net convergence.", "Human social intelligence relies on our ability to infer other people\u2019s mental states such as their beliefs, desires, and intentions. While people are proficient at mental state inference from physical action, it is unknown whether people can make inferences of comparable granularity from simple linguistic events. Here, we show that people can make quantitative mental state attributions from simple referential expressions, replicating the fine-grained inferential structure characteristic of nonlinguistic theory of mind. Moreover, people quantitatively adjust these inferences after brief exposures to speaker-specific speech patterns. These judgments matched the predictions made by our computational model of theory of mind in language, but could not be explained by a simpler qualitative model that attributes mental states deductively. Our findings show how the connection between language and theory of mind runs deep, with their interaction showing in one of the most fundamental forms of human communication: reference.", "Current conventional algorithms used for 3-dimensional simulation in virtual hepatectomy still have difficulties distinguishing the portal vein (PV) and hepatic vein (HV). The accuracy of these algorithms was compared with a new deep-learning based algorithm (DLA) using artificial intelligence.\nA total of 110 living liver donor candidates until 2017, and 46 donor candidates until 2019 were allocated to the training group and validation groups for the DLA, respectively. All PV or HV branches were labeled based on Couinaud's segment classification and the Brisbane 2000 Terminology by hepato-biliary surgeons. Misclassified and missing branches were compared between a conventional tracking-based algorithm (TA) and DLA in the validation group.\nThe sensitivity, specificity, and Dice coefficient for the PV were 0.58, 0.98, and 0.69 using the TA; and 0.84, 0.97, and 0.90 using the DLA (P\u00a0<\u00a0.001, excluding specificity); and for the HV, 0.81, 087, and 0.83 using the TA; and 0.93, 0.94 and 0.94 using the DLA (P\u00a0<\u00a0.001 to P\u00a0=\u00a0.001). The DLA exhibited greater accuracy than the TA.\nCompared with the TA, artificial intelligence enhanced the accuracy of extraction of the PV and HVs in computed tomography.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) systems offer effective support for online learning and teaching, including personalizing learning for students, automating instructors' routine tasks, and powering adaptive assessments. However, while the opportunities for AI are promising, the impact of AI systems on the culture of, norms in, and expectations about interactions between students and instructors are still elusive. In online learning, learner-instructor interaction (inter alia, communication, support, and presence) has a profound impact on students' satisfaction and learning outcomes. Thus, identifying how students and instructors perceive the impact of AI systems on their interaction is important to identify any gaps, challenges, or barriers preventing AI systems from achieving their intended potential and risking the safety of these interactions. To address this need for forward-looking decisions, we used Speed Dating with storyboards to analyze the authentic voices of 12 students and 11 instructors on diverse use cases of possible AI systems in online learning. Findings show that participants envision adopting AI systems in online learning can enable personalized learner-instructor interaction at scale but at the risk of violating social boundaries. Although AI systems have been positively recognized for improving the quantity and quality of communication, for providing just-in-time, personalized support for large-scale settings, and for improving the feeling of connection, there were concerns about responsibility, agency, and surveillance issues. These findings have implications for the design of AI systems to ensure explainability, human-in-the-loop, and careful data collection and presentation. Overall, contributions of this study include the design of AI system storyboards which are technically feasible and positively support learner-instructor interaction, capturing students' and instructors' concerns of AI systems through Speed Dating, and suggesting practical implications for maximizing the positive impact of AI systems while minimizing the negative ones.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) based self-learning or self-improving material discovery system will enable next-generation material discovery. Herein, we demonstrate how to combine accurate prediction of material performance via first-principle calculations and Bayesian optimization-based active learning to realize a self-improving discovery system for high-performance photosensitizers (PSs). Through self-improving cycles, such a system can improve the model prediction accuracy (best mean absolute error of 0.090 eV for singlet-triplet spitting) and high-performance PS search ability, realizing efficient discovery of PSs. From a molecular space with more than 7 million molecules, 5357 potential high-performance PSs were discovered. Four PSs were further synthesized to show performance comparable with or superior to commercial ones. This work highlights the potential of active learning in first-principle-based materials design, and the discovered structures could boost the development of photosensitization related applications.", "The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a global alarm. With the advances in artificial intelligence, the COVID-19 testing capabilities have been greatly expanded, and hospital resources are significantly alleviated. Over the past years, computer vision researches have focused on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which can significantly improve image analysis ability. However, CNN architectures are usually manually designed with rich expertise that is scarce in practice. Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) can automatically search for the proper CNN architectures and voluntarily optimize the related hyperparameters. The networks searched by EAs can be used to effectively process COVID-19 computed tomography images without expert knowledge and manual setup. In this paper, we propose a novel EA-based algorithm with a dynamic searching space to design the optimal CNN architectures for diagnosing COVID-19 before the pathogenic test. The experiments are performed on the COVID-CT data set against a series of state-of-the-art CNN models. The experiments demonstrate that the architecture searched by the proposed EA-based algorithm achieves the best performance yet without any preprocessing operations. Furthermore, we found through experimentation that the intensive use of batch normalization may deteriorate the performance. This contrasts with the common sense approach of manually designing CNN architectures and will help the related experts in handcrafting CNN models to achieve the best performance without any preprocessing operations.", "Sex-based biomechanical differences during a drop vertical jump (DVJ) may explain the increased risk of anterior cruciate ligament injury in females. Video motion capture using artificial intelligence (VMocap) is a new method for accurate motion analysis.\nTo use VMocap to identify sex-based differences in biomechanics during a DVJ in Asian athletes.\nControlled laboratory study.\nA total of 63 female and 61 male Asian soccer players volunteered for this study in 2018. Participants performed a bilateral DVJ using VMocap, and the knee valgus angle (KVA), knee flexion angle (KFA), hip flexion angle (HFA), and lower leg anterior inclination angle (LAIA) were calculated from the motion capture data. These joint angles and inclination angles were evaluated at the time of highest point of the first jump (H1), initial contact (IC), maximum knee flexion (MKF), toe-off (TO), and highest point of the second jump (H2). The unpaired t test was used to compare sex-based differences.\nAt H1, the KVA in females showed more valgus (-2.9\u00b0 vs -5.4\u00b0) and the LAIA in females was greater (29.1\u00b0 vs 25.7\u00b0) versus males (P < .01 for both). At IC, the KVA in females showed more valgus (-1.3\u00b0 vs -3.0\u00b0) and females had a greater KFA (20.8\u00b0 vs 14.3\u00b0) and LAIA (5.1\u00b0 vs 0.0\u00b0) compared with males (P < .01 for all). At MKF, female KVA showed more valgus (6.2\u00b0 vs -9.5\u00b0), and females had greater LAIA (36.6\u00b0 vs 34.6\u00b0), smaller KFA (77.5\u00b0 vs 87.5\u00b0), and smaller HFA (55.8\u00b0 vs 82.0\u00b0) compared with males (P < .01 for all). At TO, female KVA showed more valgus (-0.7\u00b0 vs -3.1\u00b0) and female KFA, HFA, and LAIA were greater (31.7\u00b0 vs 19.2\u00b0; 19.9\u00b0 vs 16.4\u00b0; and 18.2\u00b0 vs 11.5\u00b0, respectively) than males (P < .01 for all). At H2, females had a greater KFA (18.6\u00b0 vs 14.6\u00b0) and LAIA (13.3\u00b0 vs 9.9\u00b0) than males (P < .04 for both).\nAsian female soccer players showed increased KVA and LAIA, decreased KFA and HFA at MKF, and increased KFA at IC and TO compared with their male counterparts in this analysis of the DVJ.\nElucidation of kinematic differences between the sexes can aid in predicting injuries.", "Pneumonia is a serious disease often accompanied by complications, sometimes leading to death. Unfortunately, diagnosis of pneumonia is frequently delayed until physical and radiologic examinations are performed. Diagnosing pneumonia with cough sounds would be advantageous as a non-invasive test that could be performed outside a hospital. We aimed to develop an artificial intelligence (AI)-based pneumonia diagnostic algorithm. We collected cough sounds from thirty adult patients with pneumonia or the other causative diseases of cough. To quantify the cough sounds, loudness and energy ratio were used to represent the level and its spectral variations. These two features were used for constructing the diagnostic algorithm. To estimate the performance of developed algorithm, we assessed the diagnostic accuracy by comparing with the diagnosis by pulmonologists based on cough sound alone. The algorithm showed 90.0% sensitivity, 78.6% specificity and 84.9% overall accuracy for the 70 cases of cough sound in pneumonia group and 56 cases in non-pneumonia group. For same cases, pulmonologists correctly diagnosed the cough sounds with 56.4% accuracy. These findings showed that the proposed AI algorithm has value as an effective assistant technology to diagnose adult pneumonia patients with significant reliability.", "Foot strike detection is important when evaluating a person's gait characteristics. Accelerometer and gyroscope signals from smartphones have been used to train artificial intelligence (AI) models for automated foot strike detection in able-bodied and elderly populations. However, there is limited research on foot strike detection in lower limb amputees, who have a more variable and asymmetric gait. A novel method for automated foot strike detection in lower limb amputees was developed using raw accelerometer and gyroscope signals collected from a smartphone positioned at the posterior pelvis. Raw signals were used to train a decision tree model and long short-term memory (LSTM) model for automated foot strike detection. These models were developed using retrospective data (n = 72) collected with the TOHRC Walk Test app during a 6-min walk test (6MWT). An Android smartphone was placed on a posterior belt for each participant during the 6MWT to collect accelerometer and gyroscope signals at 50 Hz. The best model for foot strike identification was the LSTM with 100 hidden nodes in the LSTM layer, 50 hidden nodes in the dense layer, and a batch size of 64 (99.0% accuracy, 86.4% sensitivity, 99.4% specificity, and 83.7% precision). This research created a novel method for automated foot strike identification in lower extremity amputee populations that is equivalent to manual labelling and accessible for clinical use. Automated foot strike detection is required for stride analysis and to enable other AI applications, such as fall detection.", "Several personality disorders have been associated with cognitive impairment, including executive functions like working memory. Yet, it is unclear whether subclinical expression in non-clinical persons is associated with cognitive functioning. Recent studies indicate that non-clinical subjects might, in fact, perform better with increasing moderate to mild expressions of narcissistic features. We tested working memory performance in a cohort of n=70 psychiatrically and neurologically healthy subjects using Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS/WIE) subtests Arithmetic, Digit Span and Letter-Number Sequencing, and assessed narcissistic features using three different inventories: the widely used Narcissistic Personality Inventory (NPI), as well as two clinically used measures of narcissistic traits and states, respectively, derived from schema-focused therapy, i.e., the Young Schema Questionnaire (YSQ) entitlement/grandiosity subscale and the Schema Mode Inventory (SMI) self-aggrandizer subscale. In accordance with our hypothesis, we found nominally significant positive correlations of WIE Arithmetic performance with NPI total score (Spearman's rho=0.208; p=0.043) and SMI self-aggrandizer scale (Spearman's rho=0.231; p=0.027), but findings did not survive false discovery rate (FDR) adjustment for multiple comparisons (pFDR=0.189 and pFDR=0.243, respectively). While our findings add to recent studies on cognitive performance in subclinical narcissism, they fail to demonstrate an association of cognitive performance with narcissistic traits across multiple working memory tests, indicating the need for additional study, including complementary executive functions in larger cohorts and ranges of phenotype expression.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) technology is innovatively combined with participatory video for artistic creation and communication to improve the enthusiasm of art lovers for artistic creation and communication and expand the application range of AI technology. First, the interactive framework of interactive participation video is proposed based on the analysis of the related literature of interactive non-linear video. Then, a questionnaire is designed accordingly to analyze the social needs of people on art social platforms. According to the survey results, the participatory art video online communication platform is designed and preliminarily realized. Finally, a participant video eye movement control experiment is conducted to test the performance of the participatory art video development platform. Meanwhile, the platform is evaluated through field research from two aspects of test efficiency and user experience. The results show that the operation time of the participatory art video development platform is much shorter than that of the control group. It takes only approximately 15 s to complete the annotation operation with low SD, indicating that the system performance is stable. The accuracy of the platform also reaches 100%.", "The objective of the present study was to determine the use of systemic corti-costeroids (SCs) in patients with bronchial asthma using big data analysis.\nWe performed an observational, retrospective, noninterventional study based on secondary data captured from free text in the electronic health records. This study was per-formed based on data from the regional health service of Castille-La Mancha (SESCAM), Spain. We performed the analysis using big data and artificial intelligence via Savana\u00ae Manager version 3.0.\nDuring the study period, 103 667 patients were diagnosed with and treated for asthma at different care levels. The search was restricted to patients aged 10 to 90 years (mean age, 43.5 [95%CI, 43.4-43.7] years). Of these, 59.8% were women. SCs were taken for treatment of asthma by 58 745 patients at some point during the study period. These patients were older, with a higher prevalence of hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes, ob-esity, depression, and hiatus hernia. SCs are used frequently in the general population with asthma (31.4% in 2015 and 39.6% in 2019). SCs were prescribed mainly in primary care (59%), allergy (13%) and pulmonology (20%). The frequency of prescription of SCs had a direct impact on the main associated adverse effects.\nIn clinical practice, SCs are frequently prescribed to patients with asthma, especially in primary care. Use of SCs is associated with a greater number of adverse events. It is necessary to implement measures to reduce prescription of SCs to patients with asthma, especially in primary care.", "Recently, with the increase in technological capabilities and the need to reduce bias in candidate selection processes, artificial intelligence (AI)-based selection procedures have been on the rise. However, the literature indicates that candidate reactions to a selection process need to be considered by organizations that compete for employees. In this study, we investigate reactions to AI-based selection procedures in a three-dimensional vignette study among young adults in Germany. By investigating the effects of the dimensions of AI complexity, intangibility, and reliability on the perceived quality of assessment of potential candidates, we found that AI complexity and intangibility impact the perceived quality of assessment negatively when the candidates' knowledge, strengths, and weaknesses should be assessed. We also found interactive relationships of all three dimensions for the assessment of motivation. In sum, results indicate that candidates are skeptical toward the assessment quality of AI-intense selection processes, especially if these assess complex assessment criteria such as personality or a job performance forecast. Hence, organizations need to be careful when implementing AI-based selection procedures. HR implications are made on the basis of these results to cope with negative candidate perceptions.", "Emergence of coronavirus in December 2019 and its spread across the world in the following months has made it a global health concern. The uncertainty about its evolution, transmission and effect of SARS-CoV-2, has left the countries and their governments in a worrisome state. Ambiguity about the strategies that would work towards mitigating the impact of virus has prompted them to use data-driven methods. Several countries started applying big data and advanced analytics technology for management of the crisis. This study aims to understand how different nations have employed analytics to deal with COVID-19. This paper reviews various strategies employed by different governments and organizations across nations that use advanced analytics to tackle pandemic. In the current emergency of corona virus, there have been several measures that organizations have taken to mitigate its impact, thanks to the evolution of computing technology. Big data and analytical tools provide various solutions like detection of existing COVID-19 cases, prediction of future outbreak, anticipation of potential preventive and therapeutic agents, and assistance in informed decision-making. This review discusses the big data analytics and artificial intelligence approaches that policy makers, researchers, epidemiologists and private organizations have adopted. By examining the different ways and areas where data analytics has been utilized, this study provides the other nations with the progressive scheme to address the pandemic.", "Visual working memory (VWM) is the ability to actively maintain visual information over short periods of time and is strongly related to global fluid intelligence and overall cognitive ability. In our study, we used two indices of visual working memory capacity: the behavioral estimate of capacity (K) and contralateral delay activity (CDA) in order to check whether training in a Real-Time Strategy (RTS) video game StarCraft II can influence the VWM capacity measured by the change detection task. We also asked a question whether individual differences in behavioral and psychophysiological indices of VWM can predict the effectiveness of video game training. Sixty-two participants (non-players) were recruited to the experiment. Participants were randomly assigned to either experimental (Variable environment), active control (Fixed environment), and passive control groups. Experimental and active control groups differed in the type of training received. Training consisted of 30 h of playing the StarCraft II game. Participants took part in two EEG sessions (pre- and post-training) during which they performed the VWM task. Our results showed that working memory capacity (K calculated according to Pashler's formula) increases after training in both experimental groups, but not in a control group. We have also found a correlation between average visual working memory capacity (calculated as K) and mean CDA amplitude no matter which group we are looking at. And, last but not least, we have found that we can predict the amount of improvement in the RTS video game by looking at the psychophysiological indices (CDA amplitude) recorded at baseline (before training), but only in the experimental group. We think that the strength of the psychophysiological indicator of VWM capacity might be a marker of the future success in video game acquisition.", "COVID-19 has affected every individual physically or physiologically, leading to substantial impacts on how they perceive and respond to the pandemic's danger. Due to the lack of vaccines or effective medicines to cure the infection, an urgent control measure is required to prevent the continued spread of COVID-19. This can be achieved using advanced computing, such as artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), cloud computing, and edge computing. To control the exponential spread of the novel virus, it is crucial for countries to contain and mitigate interventions. To prevent exponential growth, several control measures have been applied in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to mitigate the COVID-19 epidemic. As the pandemic has been spreading globally for more than a year, an ample amount of data is available for researchers to predict and forecast the effect of the pandemic in the near future. This article interprets the effects of COVID-19 using the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR-F) while F-stands for 'Fatal with confirmation,' age-structured SEIR (Susceptible Exposed Infectious Removed) and machine learning for smart health care and the well-being of citizens of Saudi Arabia. Additionally, it examines the different control measure scenarios produced by the modified SEIR model. The evolution of the simulation results shows that the interventions are vital to flatten the virus spread curve, which can delay the peak and decrease the fatality rate.", "Biomedical applications of deep learning algorithms rely on large expert annotated data sets. The classification of bone marrow (BM) cell cytomorphology, an important cornerstone of hematological diagnosis, is still done manually thousands of times every day because of a lack of data sets and trained models. We applied convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to a large data set of 171\u2009374 microscopic cytological images taken from BM smears from 945 patients diagnosed with a variety of hematological diseases. The data set is the largest expert-annotated pool of BM cytology images available in the literature. It allows us to train high-quality classifiers of leukocyte cytomorphology that identify a wide range of diagnostically relevant cell species with high precision and recall. Our CNNs outcompete previous feature-based approaches and provide a proof-of-concept for the classification problem of single BM cells. This study is a step toward automated evaluation of BM cell morphology using state-of-the-art image-classification algorithms. The underlying data set represents an educational resource, as well as a reference for future artificial intelligence-based approaches to BM cytomorphology.", "Waste sorting is an effective means of enhancing resource or energy recovery from municipal solid waste (MSW). Waste sorting management system is not limited to source separation, but also involves at least three stages, i.e., collection and transportation (C&T), pretreatment, and resource utilization. This review focuses on the whole process of MSW management strategy based on the waste sorting perspective. Firstly, as the sources of MSW play an essential role in the means of subsequent valorization, the factors affecting the generation of MSW and its prediction methods are introduced. Secondly, a detailed comparison of approaches to source separation across countries is presented. Constructing a top-down management system and incentivizing or constraining residents' sorting behavior from the bottom up is believed to be a practical approach to promote source separation. Then, the current state of C&T techniques and its network optimization are reviewed, facilitated by artificial intelligence\u00a0(AI) and the Internet of Things technologies. Furthermore, the advances in pretreatment strategies for enhanced sorting and resource recovery are introduced briefly. Finally, appropriate methods to valorize different MSW are proposed. It is worth noting that new technologies, such as AI, show high application potential in waste management. The sharing of (intermediate) products or energy of varying processing units will inject vitality into the waste management network and achieve sustainable development.", "Allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation is the standard of care for Hurler syndrome (mucopolysaccharidosis type I, Hurler variant [MPSIH]). However, this treatment is only partially curative and is associated with complications.\nWe are conducting an ongoing study involving eight children with MPSIH. At enrollment, the children lacked a suitable allogeneic donor and had a Developmental Quotient or Intelligence Quotient score above 70 (i.e., none had moderate or severe cognitive impairment). The children received autologous hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) transduced ex vivo with an \u03b1-L-iduronidase (IDUA)-encoding lentiviral vector after myeloablative conditioning. Safety and correction of blood IDUA activity up to supraphysiologic levels were the primary end points. Clearance of lysosomal storage material as well as skeletal and neurophysiological development were assessed as secondary and exploratory end points. The planned duration of the study is 5 years.\nWe now report interim results. The children's mean (\u00b1SD) age at the time of HSPC gene therapy was 1.9\u00b10.5 years. At a median follow-up of 2.10 years, the procedure had a safety profile similar to that known for autologous hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation. All the patients showed prompt and sustained engraftment of gene-corrected cells and had supraphysiologic blood IDUA activity within a month, which was maintained up to the latest follow-up. Urinary glycosaminoglycan (GAG) excretion decreased steeply, reaching normal levels at 12 months in four of five patients who could be evaluated. Previously undetectable levels of IDUA activity in the cerebrospinal fluid became detectable after gene therapy and were associated with local clearance of GAGs. Patients showed stable cognitive performance, stable motor skills corresponding to continued motor development, improved or stable findings on magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and spine, reduced joint stiffness, and normal growth in line with World Health Organization growth charts.\nThe delivery of HSPC gene therapy in patients with MPSIH resulted in extensive metabolic correction in peripheral tissues and the central nervous system. (Funded by Fondazione Telethon and others; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT03488394; EudraCT number, 2017-002430-23.).", "Atrial fibrillation (AFib) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia associated with stroke, blood clots, heart failure, coronary artery disease, and/or death. Multiple methods have been proposed for AFib detection, with varying performances, but no single approach appears to be optimal. We hypothesized that each state-of-the-art algorithm is appropriate for different subsets of patients and provides some independent information. Therefore, a set of suitably chosen algorithms, combined in a weighted voting framework, will provide a superior performance to any single algorithm.\nWe investigate and modify 38 state-of-the-art AFib classification algorithms for a single-lead ambulatory electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring device. All algorithms are ranked using a random forest classifier and an expert-labeled training dataset of 2,532 recordings. The seven top-ranked algorithms are combined by using an optimized weighting approach.\nThe proposed fusion algorithm, when validated on a separate test dataset consisting of 4,644 recordings, resulted in an area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of 0.99. The sensitivity, specificity, positive-predictive-value (PPV), negative-predictive-value (NPV), and F1-score of the proposed algorithm were 0.93, 0.97, 0.87, 0.99, and 0.90, respectively, which were all superior to any single algorithm or any previously published.\nThis study demonstrates how a set of well-chosen independent algorithms and a voting mechanism to fuse the outputs of the algorithms, outperforms any single state-of-the-art algorithm for AFib detection. The proposed framework is a case study for the general notion of crowdsourcing between open-source algorithms in healthcare applications. The extension of this framework to similar applications may significantly save time, effort, and resources, by combining readily existing algorithms. It is also a step toward the democratization of artificial intelligence and its application in healthcare.", "Short-term memory is a dynamic psychological process that operates within a network in which non-verbal intelligence and attentional domains are connected. However, no consensus has been reached about which process has the greatest effect on this memory ability, which was the main objective of the present study. A sample of 1448 Brazilian participants (mean age = 26.62 years, standard deviation = 9.97 years; 53.9% females) were collectively tested on pen-and-paper standardized and validated measures of selective (ROTAS-C), alternating (ROTAS-A), and divided (ROTAS-D) attention. They also performed the R1 Non-verbal Intelligence Test and a visual short-term memory test (Mem\u00f3ria Visual de Curto Prazo [MEMORE] test). The statistical analyses consisted of a data mining procedure, in which exhaustive automatic selection screening was performed. The results were compared with Corrected Akaike Information Criteria. The linear model met the classic assumptions of ordinary least squares and only included main effects of selective attention (standardized \u03b2 = 0.39) and non-verbal intelligence (standardized \u03b2 = 0.37) as main predictors (F2,39 = 7.01, p < 0.01, adjusted R2 = 24%). The results are discussed within a cognitive psychology framework.", "Fast recovery, high sensitivity, high selectivity, and room temperature (RT) sensing characteristics of NO gas sensors are essential for environmental monitoring, artificial intelligence, and inflammatory diagnosis of asthma patients. However, the conventional semiconductor-type gas sensors have poor sensing characteristics that need to be solved, such as slow recovery speeds (>360 s), low sensitivity (3.8), and high operating temperatures (>300 \u00b0C). We propose here a memristor-based NO gas sensor as a gasistor (gas sensor + memory resistor) with SnO2, Ta2O5, and HfO2 films, which successfully demonstrated the feasibility of fast reaction/recovery (<1 s/90 ns) and high sensitivities such as 11.66 and 5.22 in Ta2O5 and HfO2 gasistors for NO gas, at RT. Furthermore, so as to reinforce the selectivity in multigas ambient, we suggest a parallel circuit using three kinds of gasistors having different sensitivities for NO, O2, and C2H6 gases, which results in an improvement of selectivity for the selected gas at RT.", "The Pentagon Drawing Test (PDT) is a common assessment for visuospatial function. Evaluating the PDT by artificial intelligence can improve efficiency and reliability in the big data era. This study aimed to develop a deep learning (DL) framework for automatic scoring of the PDT based on image data.\nA total of 823 PDT photos were retrospectively collected and preprocessed into black-and-white, square-shape images. Stratified fivefold cross-validation was applied for training and testing. Two strategies based on convolutional neural networks were compared. The first strategy was to perform an image classification task using supervised transfer learning. The second strategy was designed with an object detection model for recognizing the geometric shapes in the figure, followed by a predetermined algorithm to score based on their classes and positions.\nOn average, the first framework demonstrated 62%accuracy, 62%recall, 65%precision, 63%specificity, and 0.72 area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. This performance was substantially outperformed by the second framework, with averages of 94%, 95%, 93%, 93%, and 0.95, respectively.\nAn image-based DL framework based on the object detection approach may be clinically applicable for automatic scoring of the PDT with high efficiency and reliability. With a limited sample size, transfer learning should be used with caution if the new images are distinct from the previous training data. Partitioning the problem-solving workflow into multiple simple tasks should facilitate model selection, improve performance, and allow comprehensible logic of the DL framework.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have been increasingly used in materials science to build predictive models and accelerate discovery. For selected properties, availability of large databases has also facilitated application of deep learning (DL) and transfer learning (TL). However, unavailability of large datasets for a majority of properties prohibits widespread application of DL/TL. We present a cross-property deep-transfer-learning framework that leverages models trained on large datasets to build models on small datasets of different properties. We test the proposed framework on 39 computational and two experimental datasets and find that the TL models with only elemental fractions as input outperform ML/DL models trained from scratch even when they are allowed to use physical attributes as input, for 27/39 (\u2248\u200969%) computational and both the experimental datasets. We believe that the proposed framework can be widely useful to tackle the small data challenge in applying AI/ML in materials science.", "Effective and efficient education and patient engagement are fundamental to improve health outcomes in heart failure (HF). The use of artificial intelligence (AI) to enable more effective delivery of education is becoming more widespread for a range of chronic conditions. We sought to determine whether an avatar-based HF-app could improve outcomes by enhancing HF knowledge and improving patient quality of life and self-care behaviour.\nIn a randomized controlled trial of patients admitted for acute decompensated HF (ADHF), patients at high risk (\u226533%) for 30-day hospital readmission and/or death were randomized to usual care or training with the HF-app. From August 2019 up until December 2020, 200 patients admitted to the hospital for ADHF were enrolled in the Risk-HF study. Of the 72 at high-risk, 36 (25 men; median age 81.5\u2009years; 9.5\u2009years of education; 15 in NYHA Class III at discharge) were randomized into the intervention arm and were offered education involving an HF-app. Whilst 26 (72%) could not use the HF-app, younger patients [odds ratio (OR) 0.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.82-0.97; P\u2009<\u20090.01] and those with a higher education level (OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.09-2.28; P\u2009=\u20090.03) were more likely to enrol. Of those enrolled, only 2 of 10 patients engaged and completed \u226570% of the program, and 6 of the remaining 8 who did not engage were readmitted.\nAlthough AI-based education is promising in chronic conditions, our study provides a note of caution about the barriers to enrolment in critically ill, post-acute, and elderly patients.", "Background The emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) provides opportunities for demand management of sexual and reproductive health services. Conversational agents/chatbots are increasingly common, although little is known about how this technology could aid services. This study aimed to identify barriers and facilitators for engagement with sexual health chatbots to advise service developers and related health professionals. Methods In January-June 2020, we conducted face-to-face, semi-structured and online interviews to explore views on sexual health chatbots. Participants were asked to interact with a chatbot, offering advice on sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and relevant services. Participants were UK-based and recruited via social media. Data were recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed thematically. Results Forty participants (aged 18-50 years; 64% women, 77% heterosexual, 58% white) took part. Many thought chatbots could aid sex education, providing useful information about STIs and sign-posting to sexual health services in a convenient, anonymous and non-judgemental way. Some compared chatbots to health professionals or Internet search engines and perceived this technology as inferior, offering constrained content and interactivity, limiting disclosure of personal information, trust and perceived accuracy of chatbot responses. Conclusions Despite mixed attitudes towards chatbots, this technology was seen as useful for anonymous sex education but less suitable for matters requiring empathy. Chatbots may increase access to clinical services but their effectiveness and safety need to be established. Future research should identify which chatbots designs and functions lead to optimal engagement with this innovation.", "The number and complexity of clinical trials is growing, making finding and accessing trials increasingly challenging. A key barrier to increasing recruitment efficiency is patients' low awareness of trials as an option. They rarely hear about trials from oncologists, unless these are based at a research center, which introduces trial population biases. Even if patients decide to search for trial information on their own, it is difficult for laypeople to understand. Trial search tools exist, but have multiple shortcomings: complex navigation, limited search functionality, data too complex for non-specialists, and next steps unclear.\nAccess to trials via a novel trial search tool using technology, including artificial intelligence (AI), to restructure trial information and match patients to trials was the focus of this study. We focused on 6 gastrointestinal cancers for evaluating the search tool's AI model in which their trial information was restructured based on key eligibility differentiators identified. Research participants were recruited with the support of patient associations leveraging social media. They were asked to complete a survey evaluating an established tool and the novel tool to find trials relevant for them. They assessed aspects of the tools' usability on 5-level Likert scales.\nSurvey respondents had a base level of awareness of trials, with patient associations and the internet as leading information sources. The novel tool made it easier to find trials, led to an improvement in ease of understanding information presented and provided more clarity on what the next steps towards enrollment would be. Overall, this led to higher patient satisfaction.\nNovel patient-focused tools can unlock trial access for all patients. Democratizing trial information will not only increase trial accrual, but also patient satisfaction while reducing disparities. This tool could also be of value for academic or community oncologists who face similar issues when navigating trials for patients.", "Chronic liver diseases (CLDs) are becoming increasingly more prevalent in modern society. The use of imaging techniques for early detection, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), is crucial in reducing the impact of these diseases on healthcare systems. Artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms have been shown over the past decade to excel at image-based analysis tasks such as detection and segmentation. When applied to liver MRI, they have the potential to improve clinical decision making, and increase throughput by automating analyses. With Liver diseases becoming more prevalent in society, the need to implement these techniques to utilize liver MRI to its full potential, is paramount. In this review, we report on the current methods and applications of AI methods in liver MRI, with a focus on machine learning and deep learning methods. We assess four main themes of segmentation, classification, image synthesis and artefact detection, and their respective potential in liver MRI and the wider clinic. We provide a brief explanation of some of the algorithms used and explore the current challenges affecting the field. Though there are many hurdles to overcome in implementing AI methods in the clinic, we conclude that AI methods have the potential to positively aid healthcare professionals for years to come.", "Despite the many comorbidities and high mortality rate in preterm infants with patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), therapeutic strategies vary depending on the clinical setting, and most studies of the related risk factors are based on small sample populations. We aimed to compare the performance of artificial intelligence (AI) analysis with that of conventional analysis to identify risk factors associated with symptomatic PDA (sPDA) in very low birth weight infants. This nationwide cohort study included 8369 very low birth weight (VLBW) infants. The participants were divided into an sPDA group and an asymptomatic PDA or spontaneously close PDA (nPDA) group. The sPDA group was further divided into treated and untreated subgroups. A total of 47 perinatal risk factors were collected and analyzed. Multiple logistic regression was used as a standard analytic tool, and five AI algorithms were used to identify the factors associated with sPDA. Combining a large database of risk factors from nationwide registries and AI techniques achieved higher accuracy and better performance of the PDA prediction tasks, and the ensemble methods showed the best performances.", "In recent years, with the development of artificial intelligence, the use of deep learning technology for clinical information extraction has become a new trend. Clinical Event Detection (CED) as its subtask has attracted the attention from academia and industry. However, directly applying the advancements in deep learning to CED task often yields unsatisfactory results. The main reasons are due to the following two points: (1) A great number of obscure professional terms in the electronic medical record leads to poor recognition performance of model. (2) The scarcity of datasets required for the task leads to poor model robustness. Therefore, it is urgent to solve these two problems to improve model performance.\nThis paper proposes a combining data augmentation and domain information with TENER Model for Clinical Event Detection.\nWe use two evaluation metrics to compare the overall performance of the proposed model with the existing model on the 2012 i2b2 challenge dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed model achieves the best F1-score of 80.26%, type accuracy of 93% and Span F1-score of 90.33%, and outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches.\nThis paper proposes a multi-granularity information fusion encoder-decoder framework, which applies the TENER model to the CED task for the first time. It uses the pre-trained language model (BioBERT) to generate word-level features, solving the problem of a great number of obscure professional terms in the electronic medical record lead to poor recognition performance of model. In addition, this paper proposes a new data augmentation method for sequence labeling tasks, solving the problem of the scarcity of datasets required for the task leads to poor model robustness.", "Dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration in water is one of the key parameters for assessing river water quality. Artificial intelligence (AI) methods have previously proved to be accurate tools for DO concentration prediction. This study presents the implementation of a deep learning approach applied to a recurrent neural network (RNN) algorithm. The proposed deep recurrent neural network (DRNN) model is compared with support vector machine (SVM) and artificial neural network (ANN) models, formerly shown to be robust AI algorithms. The Fanno Creek in Oregon (USA) is selected as a case study and daily values of water temperature, specific conductance, streamflow discharge, pH, and DO concentration are used as input variables to predict DO concentration for three different lead times (\"t\u2009+\u20091,\" \"t\u2009+\u20093,\" and \"t\u2009+\u20097\"). Based on Pearson's correlation coefficient, several input variable combinations are formed and used for prediction. The model prediction performance is evaluated using various indices such as correlation coefficient, Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency, root mean square error, and mean absolute error. The results identify the DRNN model ([Formula: see text]) as the most accurate among the three models considered, highlighting the potential of deep learning approaches for water quality parameter prediction.", "Subjective Risk Intelligence (SRI) is the ability to consider risky and uncertain situations as opportunities rather than threats. SRI is constituted by four dimensions: attitude toward uncertainty, imaginative capability, problem solving self-efficacy and stress management. Adolescence is a period in life in which individuals face crucial life-tasks, that nowadays become complex due to uncertainty about future life and career. The present study aims to adapt the Subjective Risk Intelligence Scale (SRIS-A) for use with adolescences and examine its factor structure, psychometric properties, and relationships with related constructs (coping strategies, problem solving self-efficacy and courage). Participants were 641 Italian adolescents, balanced by gender. The results of the study showed that the suggested four-dimension scale structure adequately explained item correlations. Further, adequate reliability, construct validity and measurement invariance by gender were supported, suggesting that SRIS-A has adequate concurrent and convergent validity. Suggestions for further studies of SRI during adolescence using the SRIS-A are discussed.", "Parkinson's disease is a disabling neurodegenerative movement disorder characterized by dopaminergic neuron loss induced by \u03b1-synuclein oligomers. There is an urgent need for disease-modifying therapies for Parkinson's disease, but drug discovery is challenged by lack of in vivo models that recapitulate early stages of neurodegeneration. Invertebrate organisms, such as the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans, provide in vivo models of human disease processes that can be instrumental for initial pharmacological studies.\nTo identify early motor impairment of animals expressing \u03b1-synuclein in dopaminergic neurons, we first used a custom-built tracking microscope that captures locomotion of single C. elegans with high spatial and temporal resolution. Next, we devised a method for semi-automated and blinded quantification of motor impairment for a population of simultaneously recorded animals with multi-worm tracking and custom image processing. We then used genetic and pharmacological methods to define the features of early motor dysfunction of \u03b1-synuclein-expressing C. elegans. Finally, we applied the C. elegans model to a drug repurposing screen by combining it with an artificial intelligence platform and cell culture system to identify small molecules that inhibit \u03b1-synuclein oligomers. Screen hits were validated using in vitro and in vivo mammalian models.\nWe found a previously undescribed motor phenotype in transgenic \u03b1-synuclein C. elegans that correlates with mutant or wild-type \u03b1-synuclein protein levels and results from dopaminergic neuron dysfunction, but precedes neuronal loss. Together with artificial intelligence-driven in silico and in vitro screening, this C. elegans model identified five compounds that reduced motor dysfunction induced by \u03b1-synuclein. Three of these compounds also decreased \u03b1-synuclein oligomers in mammalian neurons, including rifabutin which has not been previously investigated for Parkinson's disease. We found that treatment with rifabutin reduced nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurodegeneration due to \u03b1-synuclein in a rat model.\nWe identified a C. elegans locomotor abnormality due to dopaminergic neuron dysfunction that models early \u03b1-synuclein-mediated neurodegeneration. Our innovative approach applying this in vivo model to a multi-step drug repurposing screen, with artificial intelligence-driven in silico and in vitro methods, resulted in the discovery of at least one drug that may be repurposed as a disease-modifying therapy for Parkinson's disease.", "Transdisciplinary solutions are needed to achieve the sustainability of ecosystem services for future generations. We propose a framework to identify the causes of ecosystem function loss and to forecast the future of ecosystem services under different climate and pollution scenarios. The framework (i) applies an artificial intelligence (AI) time-series analysis to identify relationships among environmental change, biodiversity dynamics and ecosystem functions; (ii) validates relationships between loss of biodiversity and environmental change in fabricated ecosystems; and (iii) forecasts the likely future of ecosystem services and their socioeconomic impact under different pollution and climate scenarios. We illustrate the framework by applying it to watersheds, and provide system-level approaches that enable natural capital restoration by associating multidecadal biodiversity changes to chemical pollution.", "Liver fibrosis is thought to be associated with early recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after resection. To recognize HCC patients with higher risk of early recurrence, we used a second harmonic generation and two-photon excitation fluorescence (SHG/TPEF) microscopy to create a fully quantitative fibrosis score which is able to predict early recurrence.\nThe study included 81 HCC patients receiving curative intent hepatectomy. Detailed fibrotic features of resected hepatic tissues were obtained by SHG/TPEF microscopy, and we used multi-dimensional artificial intelligence analysis to create a recurrence prediction model \"combined index\" according to the morphological collagen features of each patient's non-tumor hepatic tissues.\nOur results showed that the \"combined index\" can better predict early recurrence (area under the curve = 0.917, sensitivity = 81.8%, specificity = 90.5%), compared to alpha fetoprotein level (area under the curve = 0.595, sensitivity = 68.2%, specificity = 47.6%). Using a Cox proportional hazards analysis, a higher \"combined index\" is also a poor prognostic factor of disease-free survival and overall survival.\nBy integrating multi-dimensional artificial intelligence and SHG/TPEF microscopy, we may locate patients with a higher risk of recurrence, follow these patients more carefully, and conduct further management if needed.", "Rapid technological advances in artificial intelligence are creating opportunities for real-time algorithmic modulations of a person's facial and vocal expressions, or 'deep-fakes'. These developments raise unprecedented societal and ethical questions which, despite much recent public awareness, are still poorly understood from the point of view of moral psychology. We report here on an experimental ethics study conducted on a sample of N = 303 participants (predominantly young, western and educated), who evaluated the acceptability of vignettes describing potential applications of expressive voice transformation technology. We found that vocal deep-fakes were generally well accepted in the population, notably in a therapeutic context and for emotions judged otherwise difficult to control, and surprisingly, even if the user lies to their interlocutors about using them. Unlike other emerging technologies like autonomous vehicles, there was no evidence of social dilemma in which one would, for example, accept for others what they resent for themselves. The only real obstacle to the massive deployment of vocal deep-fakes appears to be situations where they are applied to a speaker without their knowing, but even the acceptability of such situations was modulated by individual differences in moral values and attitude towards science fiction. This article is part of the theme issue 'Voice modulation: from origin and mechanism to social impact (Part II)'.", "This conceptual paper overviews how blockchain technology is involving the operation of multi-robot collaboration for combating COVID-19 and future pandemics. Robots are a promising technology for providing many tasks such as spraying, disinfection, cleaning, treating, detecting high body temperature/mask absence, and delivering goods and medical supplies experiencing an epidemic COVID-19. For combating COVID-19, many heterogeneous and homogenous robots are required to perform different tasks for supporting different purposes in the quarantine area. Managmnt and decentralizing multi-robot play a vital role in combating COVID-19 by reducing human interaction, monitoring, delivering goods. Blockchain technology can manage multi-robot collaboration in a decentralized fashion, improve the interaction among them to exchange information, share representation, share goals, and trust. We highlight the challenges and provide the tactical solutions enabled by integrating blockchain and multi-robot collaboration to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. The proposed conceptual framework can increase the intelligence, decentralization, and autonomous operations of connected multi-robot collaboration in the blockchain network. We overview blockchain potential benefits to defining a framework of multi-robot collaboration applications to combat COVID-19 epidemics such as monitoring and outdoor and hospital End to End (E2E) delivery systems. Furthermore, we discuss the challenges and opportunities of integrated blockchain, multi-robot collaboration, and the Internet of Things (IoT) for combating COVID-19 and future pandemics.", "Yager has proposed the decision making under measure-based granular uncertainty, which can make decision with the aid of Choquet integral, measure and representative payoffs. The decision making under measure-based granular uncertainty is an effective tool to deal with uncertain issues. The intuitionistic fuzzy environment is the more real environment. Since the decision making under measure-based granular uncertainty is not based on intuitionistic fuzzy environment, it cannot effectively solve the decision issues in the intuitionistic fuzzy environment. Then, when the issues of decision making are under intuitionistic fuzzy environment, what is the decision making under measure-based granular uncertainty with intuitionistic fuzzy sets is still an open issue. To deal with this kind of issues, this paper proposes the decision making under measure-based granular uncertainty with intuitionistic fuzzy sets. The decision making under measure-based granular uncertainty with intuitionistic fuzzy sets can effectively solve the decision making issues in the intuitionistic fuzzy environment, in other words, it can extend the decision making under measure-based granular uncertainty to the intuitionistic fuzzy environment. Numerical examples are applied to verify the validity of the decision making under measure-based granular uncertainty with intuitionistic fuzzy sets. The experimental results demonstrate that the decision making under measure-based granular uncertainty with intuitionistic fuzzy sets can represent the objects successfully and make decision effectively. In addition, a practical application of applied intelligence is used to compare the performance between the proposed model and the decision making under measure-based granular uncertainty. The experimental results show that the proposed model can solve some decision problems that the decision making under measure-based granular uncertainty cannot solve.", "The aim of this paper is to distinguish the vehicle detection and count the class number in each classification from the inputs. We proposed the use of Fuzzy Guided Scale Choice (FGSC)-based SSD deep neural network architecture for vehicle detection and class counting with parameter optimization. The 'FGSC' blocks are integrated into the convolutional layers of the model, which emphasize essential features while ignoring less important ones that are not significant for the operation. We created the passing detection lines and class counting windows and connected them with the proposed FGSC-SSD deep neural network model. The 'FGSC' blocks in the convolution layer emphasize essential features and find out unnecessary features by using the scale choice method at the training stage and eliminate that significant speedup of the model. In addition, FGSC blocks avoided many unusable parameters in the saturation interval and improved the performance efficiency. In addition, the Fuzzy Sigmoid Function (FSF) increases the activation interval through fuzzy logic. While performing operations, the FGSC-SSD model reduces the computational complexity of convolutional layers and their parameters. As a result, the model tested Frames Per Second (FPS) on edge artificial intelligence (AI) and reached a real-time processing speed of 38.4 and an accuracy rate of more than 94%. Therefore, this work might be considered an improvement to the traffic monitoring approach by using edge AI applications.", "Industry 4.0 is envisioned to transform the entire economical ecosystem by the inclusion of new paradigms, such as cyber-physical systems or artificial intelligence, into the production systems and solutions. One of the main benefits of this revolution is the increase in the production systems' efficiency, thanks to real-time algorithms and automatic decision-making mechanisms. However, at the software level, these innovative algorithms are very sensitive to the quality of received data. Common malfunctions in sensor nodes, such as delays, numerical errors, corrupted data or inactivity periods, may cause a critical problem if an inadequate decision is made based on those data. Many systems remove this risk by seamlessly integrating the sensor nodes and the high-level components, but this situation substantially reduces the impact of the Industry 4.0 paradigm and increases its deployment cost. Therefore, new solutions that guarantee the interoperability of all sensors with the software elements in Industry 4.0 solutions are needed. In this paper, we propose a solution based on numerical algorithms following a predictor-corrector architecture. Using a combination of techniques, such as Lagrange polynomial and Hermite interpolation, data series may be adapted to the requirements of Industry 4.0 software algorithms. Series may be expanded, contracted or completed using predicted samples, which are later updated and corrected using the real information (if received). Results show the proposed solution works in real time, increases the quality of data series in a relevant way and reduces the error probability in Industry 4.0 systems.", "Workplace violence towards psychiatric nurses by psychiatric patients is common, which can potentially affect care quality as well as nurses' health. This study aimed to synthesize the literature on workplace violence towards psychiatric nurses and identify the prevalence and factors influencing workplace violence and related outcomes. PubMed, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, EMBASE and PsychINFO were searched for English articles on workplace violence against psychiatric nurses published from January 2011 to December 2020. Sixteen articles were selected for the systematic review. This was followed by quality assessment and data extraction. The workplace violence prevalence ranged 11.4-97.6%. Diagnosis of the patient; nurse-related factors such as age, sex, marital status, education, emotional intelligence level and personality; and work shift were associated with the occurrence of workplace violence. Psychiatric nurses who experienced workplace violence had primarily poor mental health such as depressive symptoms and negative work-related outcomes such as turnover intention. The results revealed that there were relatively few patient-related factors associated with workplace violence and few reports on workplace violence-related to nurses' physical health, suggesting the need for a multi-dimensional approach. Future studies are needed to develop standardized instruments for workplace violence investigation considering inpatients psychiatric settings. Effective workplace violence prevention strategies should consider comprehensive patient-, nurse- and occupation-related factors.", "This paper develops a framework to track the trajectory of a target in 2D by considering a moving ownship able to measure bearing measurements. Notably, the framework allows one to incorporate additional information (e.g., obtained via intelligence) such as knowledge on the fact the target's trajectory is contained in the intersection of some sets or the fact it lies outside the union of other sets. The approach is formally characterized by providing a constrained maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) formulation and by extending the definition of the Cram\u00e9r-Rao lower bound (CRLB) matrix to the case of MLE problems with inequality constraints, relying on the concept of generalized Jacobian matrix. Moreover, based on the additional information, the ownship motion is chosen by mimicking the Artificial Potential Fields technique that is typically used by mobile robots to aim at a goal (in this case, the region where the target is assumed to be) while avoiding obstacles (i.e., the region that is assumed not to intersect the target's trajectory). In order to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach, the paper is complemented by a simulation campaign where the MLE computations are carried out via an evolutionary ant colony optimization software, namely, mixed-integer distributed ant colony optimization solver (MIDACO-SOLVER). As a result, the proposed framework exhibits remarkably better performance, and in particular, we observe that the solution is less likely to remain stuck in unsatisfactory local minima during the MLE computation.", "Clinical prediction rules (CPRs) can assist clinicians by focusing their clinical evaluation on the most important signs and symptoms, and if used properly can reduce the need for diagnostic testing. This study aims to perform an updated systematic review of clinical prediction rules and classification and regression tree (CART) models for the diagnosis of influenza.\nWe searched PubMed, CINAHL, and EMBASE databases. We identified prospective studies of patients presenting with suspected influenza or respiratory infection and that reported a CPR in the form of a risk score or CART-based algorithm. Studies had to report at a minimum the percentage of patients in each risk group with influenza. Studies were evaluated for inclusion and data were extracted by reviewers working in parallel. Accuracy was summarized descriptively; where not reported by the authors the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROCC), predictive values, and likelihood ratios were calculated.\nWe identified 10 studies that presented 14 CPRs. The most commonly included predictor variables were cough, fever, chills and/or sweats, myalgias, and acute onset, all which can be ascertained by phone or telehealth visit. Most CPRs had an AUROCC between 0.7 and 0.8, indicating good discrimination. However, only 1 rule has undergone prospective external validation, with limited success. Data reporting by the original studies was in some cases inadequate to determine measures of accuracy.\nWell-designed validation studies, studies of interrater reliability between telehealth an in-person assessment, and studies using novel data mining and artificial intelligence strategies are needed to improve diagnosis of this common and important infection.", "The objective of this study is the development and validation of a novel artificial intelligence driven tool for fast and accurate mandibular canal segmentation on cone beam computed tomography (CBCT).\nA total of 235 CBCT scans from dentate subjects needing oral surgery were used in this study, allowing for development, training and validation of a deep learning algorithm for automated mandibular canal (MC) segmentation on CBCT. Shape, diameter and direction of the MC were adjusted on all CBCT slices using a voxel-wise approach. Validation was then performed on a random set of 30 CBCTs - previously unseen by the algorithm - where voxel-level annotations allowed for assessment of all MC segmentations.\nPrimary results show successful implementation of the AI algorithm for segmentation of the MC with a mean IoU of 0.636 (\u00b1 0.081), a median IoU of 0.639 (\u00b1 0.081), a mean Dice Similarity Coefficient of 0.774 (\u00b1 0.062). Precision, recall and accuracy had mean values of 0.782 (\u00b1 0.121), 0.792 (\u00b1 0.108) and 0.99 (\u00b1 7.64\u00d710-05) respectively. The total time for automated AI segmentation was 21.26\u00a0s (\u00b12.79), which is 107 times faster than accurate manual segmentation.\nThis study demonstrates a novel, fast and accurate AI-driven module for MC segmentation on CBCT.\nGiven the importance of adequate pre-operative mandibular canal assessment, Artificial Intelligence could help relieve practitioners from the delicate and time-consuming task of manually tracing and segmenting this structure, helping prevent per- and post-operative neurovascular complications.", "The planning and control of team sport training activities is an extremely important aspect of athletic development and team performance. This research introduces a novel system which leverages techniques from the fields of control system theory and artificial intelligence to construct optimal future training plans when unexpected disturbances and deviations from a training plan goal occur.\nSimulation-based experimental design.\nThe adaptation of training load prescriptions was formulated as an optimal control problem where we seek to minimize the difference between a desired training plan goal and an observed training outcome. To determine the most suitable approach to optimize future training loads the performance of an artificial intelligence-based feedback controller was compared to random and proportional controllers. Computational simulations (N\u202f=\u202f1800) were conducted using a non-linear training plan spanning 60\u202fdays over a 12-week period, and the control strategies were assessed on their ability to adapt future training loads when disturbances and deviations from an optimal planning policy have occurred. Statistical analysis was conducted to determine if significant differences existed between the three control strategies.\nThe results of a repeated measures analysis of variance demonstrated that an intelligent feedback controller significantly outperforms the random (p\u202f<\u202f.001, ES\u202f=\u202f7.41, very large) and proportional control (p\u202f<\u202f.001, ES = 7.41, very large) strategies at reducing the deviations from a training plan goal.\nThis system can be used to support the decision making of practitioners across several areas considered important for the effective planning and adaption of athletic training.", "Gastrointestinal cancers are among the leading causes of death worldwide, with over 2.8 million deaths annually. Over the last few decades, advancements in artificial intelligence technologies have led to their application in medicine. The use of artificial intelligence in endoscopic procedures is a significant breakthrough in modern medicine. Currently, the diagnosis of various gastrointestinal cancer relies on the manual interpretation of radiographic images by radiologists and various endoscopic images by endoscopists. This can lead to diagnostic variabilities as it requires concentration and clinical experience in the field. Artificial intelligence using machine or deep learning algorithms can provide automatic and accurate image analysis and thus assist in diagnosis. In the field of gastroenterology, the application of artificial intelligence can be vast from diagnosis, predicting tumor histology, polyp characterization, metastatic potential, prognosis, and treatment response. It can also provide accurate prediction models to determine the need for intervention with computer-aided diagnosis. The number of research studies on artificial intelligence in gastrointestinal cancer has been increasing rapidly over the last decade due to immense interest in the field. This review aims to review the impact, limitations, and future potentials of artificial intelligence in screening, diagnosis, tumor staging, treatment modalities, and prediction models for the prognosis of various gastrointestinal cancers.", "Screening children for communicational disorders such as specific language impairment (SLI) is always challenging as it requires clinicians to follow a series of steps to evaluate the subjects. Artificial intelligence and computer-aided diagnosis have supported health professionals in making swift and error-free decisions about the neurodevelopmental state of children vis-\u00e0-vis language comprehension and production. Past studies have claimed that typical developing (TD) and SLI children show distinct vocal characteristics that can serve as discriminating facets between them. The objective of this study is to group children in SLI or TD categories by processing their raw speech signals using two proposed approaches: a customized convolutional neural network (CNN) model and a hybrid deep-learning framework where CNN is combined with long-short-term-memory (LSTM).\nWe considered a publicly available speech database of SLI and typical children of Czech accents for this study. The convolution filters in both the proposed CNN and hybrid models (CNN-LSTM) estimated fuzzy-automated features from the speech utterance. We performed the experiments in five separate sessions. Data augmentations were performed in each of those sessions to enhance the training strength.\nOur hybrid model exhibited a perfect 100% accuracy and F-measure for almost all the session-trials compared to CNN alone which achieved an average accuracy close to 90% and F-measure \u2265 92%. The models have further illustrated their robust classification essences by securing values of reliability indexes over 90%.\nThe results confirm the effectiveness of proposed approaches for the detection of SLI in children using their raw speech signals. Both the models do not require any dedicated feature extraction unit for their operations. The models may also be suitable for screening SLI and other neurodevelopmental disorders in children of different linguistic accents.", "Convolutional neural networks have become one of the most powerful computing tools of artificial intelligence in recent years. They are especially suitable for the analysis of images and other data that have an inherent sequence structure, such as time series data. In the case of data in the form of vectors of features, the order of which does not matter, the use of convolutional neural networks is not justified. This paper presents a new method of representing non-sequential data as images that can be analyzed by a convolutional network. The well-known Kohonen network was used for this purpose. After training on non-sequential data, each example is represented by so-called U-image that can be used as input to a convolutional layer. A hybrid approach was also presented, where the neural network uses two types of input signals, both U-image representation and the original features. The results of the proposed method on traditional machine learning databases as well as on a difficult classification problem originating from the analysis of measurement data from experiments in particle physics are presented.", "In modern years, network edges have been explored by many applications to lower communication and management costs. They are also integrated with the internet of things (IoT) to achieve network design, in terms of scalability and heterogeneous services for multimedia applications. Many proposed solutions are performing a vital role in the development of robust protocols and reducing the response time for critical networks. However, most of them are not able to support the forwarding processes of high multimedia traffic under dynamic characteristics with constraint bandwidth. Moreover, they increase the rate of data loss in an uncertain environment and compromise network performance by increasing delivery delay. Therefore, this paper presents an optimization model with mobile edges for multimedia sensors using artificial intelligence of things, which aims to maintain the process of real-time data collection with low consumption of resources. Moreover, it improves the unpredictability of network communication with the integration of software-defined networks (SDN) and mobile edges. Firstly, it utilizes the artificial intelligence of things (AIoT), forming the multi-hop network and guaranteed the primary services for constraints network with stable resources management. Secondly, the SDN performs direct association with mobile edges to support the load balancing for multimedia sensors and centralized the management. Finally, multimedia traffic is heading towards applications in an unchanged form and without negotiating using the sharing of subkeys. The experimental results demonstrated its effectiveness for delivery rate by an average of 35%, processing delay by an average of 29%, network overheads by an average of 41%, packet drop ratio by an average of 39%, and packet retransmission by an average of 34% against existing solutions.", "Human activity recognition plays a prominent role in numerous applications like smart homes, elderly healthcare and ambient intelligence. The complexity of human behavior leads to the difficulty of developing an accurate activity recognizer, especially in situations where different activities have similar sensor readings. Accordingly, how to measure the relationships among activities and construct an activity recognizer for better distinguishing the confusing activities remains critical. To this end, we in this study propose a clustering guided hierarchical framework to discriminate on-going human activities. Specifically, we first introduce a clustering-based activity confusion index and exploit it to automatically and quantitatively measure the confusion between activities in a data-driven way instead of relying on the prior domain knowledge. Afterwards, we design a hierarchical activity recognition framework under the guidance of the confusion relationships to reduce the recognition errors between similar activities. Finally, the simulations on the benchmark datasets are evaluated and results show the superiority of the proposed model over its competitors. In addition, we experimentally evaluate the key components of the framework comprehensively, which indicates its flexibility and stability.", "This paper considers the use of a post metadata-based approach to identifying intentionally deceptive online content. It presents the use of an inherently explainable artificial intelligence technique, which utilizes machine learning to train an expert system, for this purpose. It considers the role of three factors (textual context, speaker background, and emotion) in fake news detection analysis and evaluates the efficacy of using key factors, but not the inherently subjective processing of post text itself, to identify deceptive online content. This paper presents initial work on a potential deceptive content detection tool and also, through the networks that it presents for this purpose, considers the interrelationships of factors that can be used to determine whether a post is deceptive content or not and their comparative importance.", "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder affecting over 6 million people globally. Although there are symptomatic treatments that can increase the survivability of the disease, there are no curative treatments. The prevalence of PD and disability-adjusted life years continue to increase steadily, leading to a growing burden on patients, their families, society and the economy. Dopaminergic medications can significantly slow down the progression of PD when applied during the early stages. However, these treatments often become less effective with the disease progression. Early diagnosis of PD is crucial for immediate interventions so that the patients can remain self-sufficient for the longest period of time possible. Unfortunately, diagnoses are often late, due to factors such as a global shortage of neurologists skilled in early PD diagnosis. Computer-aided diagnostic (CAD) tools, based on artificial intelligence methods, that can perform automated diagnosis of PD, are gaining attention from healthcare services. In this review, we have identified 63 studies published between January 2011 and July 2021, that proposed deep learning models for an automated diagnosis of PD, using various types of modalities like brain analysis (SPECT, PET, MRI and EEG), and motion symptoms (gait, handwriting, speech and EMG). From these studies, we identify the best performing deep learning model reported for each modality and highlight the current limitations that are hindering the adoption of such CAD tools in healthcare. Finally, we propose new directions to further the studies on deep learning in the automated detection of PD, in the hopes of improving the utility, applicability and impact of such tools to improve early detection of PD globally.", "It was compared the level of perceived emotional intelligence (PEI) with prevalence or not prevalence of life of use of psychoactive substances (PLU-PS or n-PLU-PS) in 559 school adolescents in the city of Monteria, Colombia [men 49.69%, women 50.4%, average age 15 and range 12-18 years]. In this descriptive and cross-sectional study, an ad hoc questionnaire was applied to obtain socio-demographic and clinical data that evaluate the PLU-PS and the TMMS-24 questionnaire for the PEI. It appears with a higher prevalence of life of use alcohol, followed by cannabis and tobacco. When the groups were compared according to their PLU-PS or n-PLU-PS, in relation to the dimensions of the PEI, it was found that those who never used alcohol presented a better emotional clarity. The women with not prevalence of life of use of alcohol, perceived their emotions more clearly and those of others, but no significant differences were found in the groups and the other substances against the PEI. This would be a protective factor for the drug use, particularly alcohol and avoid the early appearance of PLU-PS. A low PEI can lead to consumption of alcohol, but its consumption would also affect the abilities of PEI. It is recommended the development of investigations the measuring the skills of emotional intelligence (EI), transcending only its perception. Likewise, the design of psychoeducational programs in EI for the prevention of psychoactive substances use.", "There are more and more foreigners in Poland who become clients of the Polish healthcare system. They use, among others, emergency medical services provided by healthcare professionals: doctors, nurses, and paramedics. Skillful care for culturally different patients requires cultural competencies and cultural intelligence to ensure good quality of care and cultural safety. The study aimed to measure and assess the cultural competencies and cultural intelligence of medical professionals working in hospital emergency departments (HEDs) and hospital emergency rooms (HERs) in Ma\u0142opolska, a region in southern Poland.\nThe following questionnaires were used in the study: the Cross-Cultural Competence Inventory (CCCI), the Cultural Intelligence Scale (CQS), and Questionnaire on Attitudes Towards Culturally Divergent People. In total, 709 medical professionals participated in the study, including 363 nurses, 223 paramedics, and 123 doctors.\nCultural intelligence-the overall score and the scores on the metacognitive, cognitive, motivational, and behavioral subscales were significantly higher among HED and HER doctors. Cultural competencies-the overall score and the score on the cultural adaptation subscale were also significantly higher among HED and HER doctors. The CCCI and CQS scores were influenced by selected variables: taking care of and close interactions with representatives of other cultural circles; staying outside Poland for more than a month. Doctors were the group of medical professionals that were most tolerant and most positive towards people from other cultures.\nThe research results confirm the positive impact of contact of medical professionals with people from other cultures on their cultural competencies and cultural intelligence. They indicate the need for training in acquiring cultural competencies and developing cultural intelligence, especially among nurses. They demonstrate the need to raise awareness among HED and HER medical professionals about issues in intercultural care and to increase diversity efforts, especially among nurses.", "Objective Dyslexia diagnosis is a challenging task, since traditional diagnosis methods are not based on biological markers but on behavioural tests. Although dyslexia diagnosis has been addressed by these tests in clinical practice, it is difficult to extract information about the brain processes involved in the different tasks and, then, to go deeper into its biological basis. Thus, the use of biomarkers can contribute not only to the diagnosis but also to a better understanding of specific learning disorders such as dyslexia. In this work, we use Electroencephalography (EEG) signals to discover differences among controls and dyslexic subjects using signal processing and artificial intelligence techniques. Specifically, we measure phase synchronization among channels, to reveal the functional brain network activated during auditory processing. On the other hand, to explore synchronicity patterns risen by low-level auditory processing, we used specific stimuli consisting in band-limited white noise, modulated in amplitude at different frequencies. The differential information contained in the functional (i.e., synchronization) network has been processed by an anomaly detection system that addresses the problem of subjects variability by an outlier-detection method based on vector quantization. The results, obtained for 7 years-old children, show that the proposed method constitutes an useful tool for clinical use, with the area under ROC curve (AUC) values up to 0.95 in differential diagnosis tasks.", "Diverse forms of artificial intelligence (AI) are at the forefront of triggering digital security innovations based on the threats that are arising in this post-COVID world. On the one hand, companies are experiencing difficulty in dealing with security challenges with regard to a variety of issues ranging from system openness, decision making, quality control, and web domain, to mention a few. On the other hand, in the last decade, research has focused on security capabilities based on tools such as platform complacency, intelligent trees, modeling methods, and outage management systems in an effort to understand the interplay between AI and those issues. the dependence on the emergence of AI in running industries and shaping the education, transports, and health sectors is now well known in the literature. AI is increasingly employed in managing data security across economic sectors. Thus, a literature review of AI and system security within the current digital society is opportune. This paper aims at identifying research trends in the field through a systematic bibliometric literature review (LRSB) of research on AI and system security. the review entails 77 articles published in the Scopus\u00ae database, presenting up-to-date knowledge on the topic. the LRSB results were synthesized across current research subthemes. Findings are presented. the originality of the paper relies on its LRSB method, together with an extant review of articles that have not been categorized so far. Implications for future research are suggested.", "To assess the diagnostic accuracy measures such as sensitivity and specificity of smartphone-based artificial intelligence (AI) approaches in the detection of diabetic retinopathy (DR).\nA literature search of the EMBASE and MEDLINE databases (up to March 2020) was conducted. Only studies using both smartphone-based cameras and AI software for image analysis were included. The main outcome measures were pooled sensitivity and specificity, diagnostic odds ratios and relative risk of smartphone-based AI approaches in detecting DR (of all types), and referable DR (RDR) (moderate nonproliferative retinopathy or worse and/or the presence of diabetic macular edema).\nSmartphone-based AI has a pooled sensitivity of 89.5% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 82.3%-94.0%) and pooled specificity of 92.4% (95% CI: 86.4%-95.9%) in detecting DR. For referable disease, sensitivity is 97.9% (95% CI: 92.6%-99.4%), and the pooled specificity is 85.9% (95% CI: 76.5%-91.9%). The technology is better at correctly identifying referable retinopathy.\nThe smartphone-based AI programs demonstrate high diagnostic accuracy for the detection of DR and RDR and are potentially viable substitutes for conventional diabetic screening approaches. Further, high-quality randomized controlled trials are required to establish the effectiveness of this approach in different populations.", "To develop and validate an automatic retinal pigment epithelial and outer retinal atrophy (RORA) progression prediction model for nonexudative age-related macular degeneration (AMD) cases in optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans.\nLongitudinal OCT data from 129 eyes/119 patients with RORA was collected and separated into training and testing groups. RORA was automatically segmented in all scans and additionally manually annotated in the test scans. OCT-based features such as layers thicknesses, mean reflectivity, and a drusen height map served as an input to the deep neural network. Based on the baseline OCT scan or the previous visit OCT, en face RORA predictions were calculated for future patient visits. The performance was quantified over time with the means of Dice scores and square root area errors.\nThe average Dice score for segmentations at baseline was 0.85. When predicting progression from baseline OCTs, the Dice scores ranged from 0.73 to 0.80 for total RORA area and from 0.46 to 0.72 for RORA growth region. The square root area error ranged from 0.13 mm to 0.33 mm. By providing continuous time output, the model enabled creation of a patient-specific atrophy risk map.\nWe developed a machine learning method for RORA progression prediction, which provides continuous-time output. It was used to compute atrophy risk maps, which indicate time-to-RORA-conversion, a novel and clinically relevant way of representing disease progression.\nApplication of recent advances in artificial intelligence to predict patient-specific progression of atrophic AMD.", "Terahertz (THz) technology lays the foundation for next-generation high-speed wireless communication, nondestructive testing, food safety inspecting, and medical applications. When THz technology is integrated by artificial intelligence (AI), it is confidently expected that THz technology could be accelerated from the laboratory research stage to practical industrial applications. Employing THz video imaging, we can gain more insights into the internal morphology of silkworm egg. Deep learning algorithm combined with THz silkworm egg images, rapid recognition of the silkworm egg development stages is successfully demonstrated, with a recognition accuracy of \u223c98.5%. Through the fusion of optical imaging and THz imaging, we further improve the AI recognition accuracy of silkworm egg development stages to \u223c99.2%. The proposed THz imaging technology not only features the intrinsic THz imaging advantages, but also possesses AI merits of low time consuming and high recognition accuracy, which can be extended to other application scenarios.", "Being able to interpret a model's predictions is a crucial task in many machine learning applications. Specifically, local interpretability is important in determining why a model makes particular predictions. Despite the recent focus on interpretable Artificial Intelligence (AI), there have been few studies on local interpretability methods for time series forecasting, while existing approaches mainly focus on time series classification tasks. In this study, we propose two novel evaluation metrics for time series forecasting: Area Over the Perturbation Curve for Regression and Ablation Percentage Threshold. These two metrics can measure the local fidelity of local explanation methods. We extend the theoretical foundation to collect experimental results on four popular datasets. Both metrics enable a comprehensive comparison of numerous local explanation methods, and an intuitive approach to interpret model predictions. Lastly, we provide heuristical reasoning for this analysis through an extensive numerical study.", "As the importance of artificial intelligence (AI) in the clinical setting increases, the need for clinicians to understand AI is also increasing. This review focuses on the fundamental principles of AI and the current state of cardiovascular AI. Various types of cardiovascular AI have been developed for evaluating examinations such as X-rays, electrocardiogram, echocardiography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging. Cardiovascular AI achieves high accuracy in diagnostic support and prognosis prediction. Furthermore, it can even detect abnormalities that were previously difficult for cardiologists to detect. Randomized controlled trials begin to be reported to verify the usefulness of cardiovascular AI. The day is approaching when cardiovascular AI will be commonly used in clinical practice. Various types of medical AI will be used for cardiovascular care; however, it will not replace medical doctors. We need to understand the strengths and weaknesses of medical AI so that cardiologists can effectively use AI to improve the medical care of patients.", "The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pneumonia has become a serious health challenge in countries worldwide. Many radiological findings have shown that X-ray and CT imaging scans are an effective solution to assess disease severity during the early stage of COVID-19. Many artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted diagnosis works have rapidly been proposed to focus on solving this classification problem and determine whether a patient is infected with COVID-19. Most of these works have designed networks and applied a single CT image to perform classification; however, this approach ignores prior information such as the patient's clinical symptoms. Second, making a more specific diagnosis of clinical severity, such as slight or severe, is worthy of attention and is conducive to determining better follow-up treatments. In this paper, we propose a deep learning (DL) based dual-tasks network, named FaNet, that can perform rapid both diagnosis and severity assessments for COVID-19 based on the combination of 3D CT imaging and clinical symptoms. Generally, 3D CT image sequences provide more spatial information than do single CT images. In addition, the clinical symptoms can be considered as prior information to improve the assessment accuracy; these symptoms are typically quickly and easily accessible to radiologists. Therefore, we designed a network that considers both CT image information and existing clinical symptom information and conducted experiments on 416 patient data, including 207 normal chest CT cases and 209 COVID-19 confirmed ones. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the additional symptom prior information as well as the network architecture designing. The proposed FaNet achieved an accuracy of 98.28% on diagnosis assessment and 94.83% on severity assessment for test datasets. In the future, we will collect more covid-CT patient data and seek further improvement.", "COVID-19 pandemic is increasing in an exponential rate, with restricted accessibility of rapid test kits. So, the design and implementation of COVID-19 testing kits remain an open research problem. Several findings attained using radio-imaging approaches recommend that the images comprise important data related to coronaviruses. The application of recently developed artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, integrated with radiological imaging, is helpful in the precise diagnosis and classification of the disease. In this view, the current research paper presents a novel fusion model hand-crafted with deep learning features called FM-HCF-DLF model for diagnosis and classification of COVID-19. The proposed FM-HCF-DLF model comprises three major processes, namely Gaussian filtering-based preprocessing, FM for feature extraction and classification. FM model incorporates the fusion of handcrafted features with the help of local binary patterns (LBP) and deep learning (DL) features and it also utilizes convolutional neural network (CNN)-based Inception v3 technique. To further improve the performance of Inception v3 model, the learning rate scheduler using Adam optimizer is applied. At last, multilayer perceptron (MLP) is employed to carry out the classification process. The proposed FM-HCF-DLF model was experimentally validated using chest X-ray dataset. The experimental outcomes inferred that the proposed model yielded superior performance with maximum sensitivity of 93.61%, specificity of 94.56%, precision of 94.85%, accuracy of 94.08%, F score of 93.2% and kappa value of 93.5%.", "The last decade has seen significant progress identifying genetic and brain differences related to intelligence. However, there remain considerable gaps in our understanding of how cognitive mechanisms that underpin intelligence map onto various brain functions. In this article, we argue that the locus coeruleus-norepinephrine system is essential for understanding the biological basis of intelligence. We review evidence suggesting that the locus coeruleus-norepinephrine system plays a central role at all levels of brain function, from metabolic processes to the organization of large-scale brain networks. We connect this evidence with our executive attention view of working-memory capacity and fluid intelligence and present analyses on baseline pupil size, an indicator of locus coeruleus activity. Using a latent variable approach, our analyses showed that a common executive attention factor predicted baseline pupil size. Additionally, the executive attention function of disengagement--not maintenance--uniquely predicted baseline pupil size. These findings suggest that the ability to control attention may be important for understanding how cognitive mechanisms of fluid intelligence map onto the locus coeruleus-norepinephrine system. We discuss how further research is needed to better understand the relationships between fluid intelligence, the locus coeruleus-norepinephrine system, and functionally organized brain networks.", "Objective: This aim of this study was to determine which variables from the demographic data most affect the EI regarding the COVID-19 outbreak and the lockdown amongst the nursing and midwifery students in Jordan. Background: Emotional intelligence (EI) is the ability to recognize, express, comprehend, motivate, influence and regulate emotions proposed the first EI model, which includes three constructs: emotion assessment and expression, emotion consumption and emotion control. During the COVID-19 outbreak and lockdown, face-to-face study methods have been replaced by online teaching, which has caused many psychological effects. Method: A cross-sectional approach was used to measure EI for nursing and midwifery students. The tool was completed online by nursing and midwifery students using Google Forms. All of the findings were received online and then analyzed accordingly. In this study, USMEQ-i was used to gather data from the participants. Results: The general EI score for the student respondents falls into the average score (M = 39.6). Regarding the difference between males and females, the results showed no significant difference. Moreover, the general linear regressions analysis of independent variables on EI score showed four significant factors. Nursing students who study in Years 1 and 4 had significantly higher EI scores than those in Years 2 and 3. EI ability decreased when a student's economic status changed from luxurious to middle income. Moreover, an increase in age significantly decreased the value of EI. This study indicates that all nursing and midwifery students who enrolled in general nursing program tended to have higher EI scores than others (p = 0.006). Conclusion: Year of study, age, average lifestyle and enrollment in a nursing program were found to be the most significant factors associated with EI amongst Jordanian nursing and midwifery students. This issue needs to be researched further, such that appropriate steps can be taken to address it.", "Malignant epithelial ovarian tumors (MEOTs) are the most lethal gynecologic malignancies, accounting for 90% of ovarian cancer cases. By contrast, borderline epithelial ovarian tumors (BEOTs) have low malignant potential and are generally associated with a good prognosis. Accurate preoperative differentiation between BEOTs and MEOTs is crucial for determining the appropriate surgical strategies and improving the postoperative quality of life. Multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an essential diagnostic tool. Although state-of-the-art artificial intelligence technologies such as convolutional neural networks can be used for automated diagnoses, their application have been limited owing to their high demand for graphics processing unit memory and hardware resources when dealing with large 3D volumetric data. In this study, we used multimodal MRI with a multiple instance learning (MIL) method to differentiate between BEOT and MEOT. We proposed the use of MAC-Net, a multiple instance convolutional neural network (MICNN) with modality-based attention (MA) and contextual MIL pooling layer (C-MPL). The MA module can learn from the decision-making patterns of clinicians to automatically perceive the importance of different MRI modalities and achieve multimodal MRI feature fusion based on their importance. The C-MPL module uses strong prior knowledge of tumor distribution as an important reference and assesses contextual information between adjacent images, thus achieving a more accurate prediction. The performance of MAC-Net is superior, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.878, surpassing that of several known MICNN approaches. Therefore, it can be used to assist clinical differentiation between BEOTs and MEOTs.", "There has been recent immense interest in the use of machine learning techniques in the prediction and screening of atrial fibrillation, a common rhythm disorder present with significant clinical implications primarily related to the risk of ischemic cerebrovascular events and heart failure. Prior to the advent of the application of artificial intelligence in clinical medicine, previous studies have enumerated multiple clinical risk factors that can predict the development of atrial fibrillation. These clinical parameters include previous diagnoses, laboratory data (e.g., cardiac and inflammatory biomarkers, etc.), imaging data (e.g., cardiac computed tomography, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, echocardiography, etc.), and electrophysiological data. These data are readily available in the electronic health record and can be automatically queried by artificial intelligence algorithms. With the modern computational capabilities afforded by technological advancements in computing and artificial intelligence, we present the current state of machine learning methodologies in the prediction and screening of atrial fibrillation as well as the implications and future direction of this rapidly evolving field.", "One controversial area of direct-to-consumer genetic testing in China is \"genetic talent testing\" for children. In this study, I show that while experts criticize genetic talent testing as unscientific, the persistence of genetic talent testing is not merely a product of parents' scientific illiteracy. Instead, genetic talent testing reflects parents' pragmatic use of technology in response to the parenting pressures in contemporary China. Parents see the results of genetic talent testing as offering an advantage for their children when combined with the intensive parenting strategy of precision education. Drawing on the sociology of testing, I argue how genetic talent testing in China is a product of broader concerns about population quality and can potentially reshape how parents imagine quality children through the theory of multiple intelligences. My study of this \"off label\" use of direct-to-consumer genetic testing also suggests that scientists need to broaden their imagination of potential misuses of their technologies.", "This paper presents a comprehensive model for representing and reasoning on situations to support decision makers in Intelligence analysis activities. The main result presented in the paper stems from a work of refinement and abstraction of previous results of the authors related to the use of Situation Awareness and Granular Computing for the development of analysis methods and techniques to support Intelligence. This work made it possible to derive the characteristics of the model from previous case studies and applications with real data, and to link the reasoning techniques to concrete approaches used by intelligence analysts such as, for example, the Structured Analytic Techniques. The model allows to represent an operational situation according to three complementary perspectives: descriptive, relational and behavioral. These three perspectives are instantiated on the basis of the principles and methods of Granular Computing, mainly based on the theories of fuzzy and rough sets, and with the help of further structures such as graphs. As regards the reasoning on the situations thus represented, the paper presents four methods with related case studies and applications validated on real data.", "Deep learning (DL) is a branch of machine learning and artificial intelligence that has been applied to many areas in different domains such as health care and drug design. Cancer prognosis estimates the ultimate fate of a cancer subject and provides survival estimation of the subjects. An accurate and timely diagnostic and prognostic decision will greatly benefit cancer subjects. DL has emerged as a technology of choice due to the availability of high computational resources. The main components in a standard computer-aided design (CAD) system are preprocessing, feature recognition, extraction and selection, categorization, and performance assessment. Reduction of costs associated with sequencing systems offers a myriad of opportunities for building precise models for cancer diagnosis and prognosis prediction. In this survey, we provided a summary of current works where DL has helped to determine the best models for the cancer diagnosis and prognosis prediction tasks. DL is a generic model requiring minimal data manipulations and achieves better results while working with enormous volumes of data. Aims are to scrutinize the influence of DL systems using histopathology images, present a summary of state-of-the-art DL methods, and give directions to future researchers to refine the existing methods.", "Clinical supervisors make judgements about how much to trust learners with critical activities in patient care. Such decisions mediate trainees' opportunities for learning and competency development and thus are a critical component of education. As educators apply entrustment frameworks to assessment, it is important to determine how narrative feedback reflecting entrustment may also address learners' educational needs.\nIn this study, we used artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP) to identify characteristics of feedback tied to supervisors' entrustment decisions during direct observation encounters of clerkship medical students (3328 unique observations). Supervisors conducted observations of students and collaborated with them to complete an entrustment-based assessment in which they documented narrative feedback and assigned an entrustment rating. We trained a deep neural network (DNN) to predict entrustment levels from the narrative data and developed an explainable AI protocol to uncover the latent thematic features the DNN used to make its prediction.\nWe found that entrustment levels were associated with level of detail (specific steps for performing clinical tasks), feedback type (constructive versus reinforcing) and task type (procedural versus cognitive). In justifying both high and low levels of entrustment, supervisors detailed concrete steps that trainees performed (or did not yet perform) competently.\nFraming our results in the factors previously identified as influencing entrustment, we find a focus on performance details related to trainees' clinical competency as opposed to nonspecific feedback on trainee qualities. The entrustment framework reflected in feedback appeared to guide specific goal-setting, combined with details necessary to reach those goals. Our NLP methodology can also serve as a starting point for future work on entrustment and feedback as similar assessment datasets accumulate.", "Ocular involvement is a rare manifestation of tuberculosis. Four key issues historically faced by clinicians when diagnosing and treating ocular tuberculosis - diagnostic uncertainty, naturally heterogeneous presentations, limitations of existing laboratory diagnostic tools, and non-uniform treatment guidelines - continue to test today's physicians. Unparalleled scientific and clinical developments over the past century have greatly expanded the knowledge surrounding this challenging ophthalmic condition. Experience with large volumes of cases at tuberculosis-endemic centres has led to recent growth in knowledge and physician experience, perhaps more so in developing countries. Looking forward, the role of diverse new technologies, including artificial intelligence and proteomics, will advance ocular tuberculosis research. Efforts have been made to address the lack of standardized nomenclature, diagnostic uncertainty, and unvalidated, geographically variable treatment guidelines.", "Nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) affects almost 6 million Americans and is a major contributor to stroke but is significantly undiagnosed and undertreated despite explicit guidelines for oral anticoagulation.\nThe aim of this study is to investigate whether the use of semisupervised natural language processing (NLP) of electronic health record's (EHR) free-text information combined with structured EHR data improves NVAF discovery and treatment and perhaps offers a method to prevent thousands of deaths and save billions of dollars.\nWe abstracted 96,681 participants from the University of Buffalo faculty practice's EHR. NLP was used to index the notes and compare the ability to identify NVAF, congestive heart failure, hypertension, age \u226575 years, diabetes mellitus, stroke or transient ischemic attack, vascular disease, age 65 to 74 years, sex category (CHA2DS2-VASc), and Hypertension,\u00a0Abnormal liver/renal function,\u00a0Stroke history,\u00a0Bleeding history or predisposition,\u00a0Labile INR,\u00a0Elderly,\u00a0Drug/alcohol usage (HAS-BLED) scores using unstructured data (International Classification of Diseases codes) versus structured and unstructured data from clinical notes. In addition, we analyzed data from 63,296,120 participants in the Optum and Truven databases to determine the NVAF frequency, rates of CHA2DS2\u2011VASc \u22652, and no contraindications to oral anticoagulants, rates of stroke and death in the untreated population, and first year's costs after stroke.\nThe structured-plus-unstructured method would have identified 3,976,056 additional true NVAF cases (P<.001) and improved sensitivity for CHA2DS2-VASc and HAS-BLED scores compared with the structured data alone (P=.002 and P<.001, respectively), causing a 32.1% improvement. For the United States, this method would prevent an estimated 176,537 strokes, save 10,575 lives, and save >US $13.5 billion.\nArtificial intelligence-informed bio-surveillance combining NLP of free-text information with structured EHR data improves data completeness, prevents thousands of strokes, and saves lives and funds. This method is applicable to many disorders with profound public health consequences.", "Stimulation and continuous monitoring of neural activities at cellular resolution are required for the understanding of the sensory processing of stimuli and development of effective neuromodulation therapies. We present bioluminescence multi-characteristic opsin (bMCOII), a hybrid optogenetic actuator, and a bioluminescence Ca2+ sensor for excitation-free, continuous monitoring of neural activities in the visual cortex, with high spatiotemporal resolution. An exceptionally low intensity (10 \u03bcW/mm2) of light could elicit neural activation that could be detected by Ca2+ bioluminescence imaging. An uninterrupted (>14 h) recording of visually evoked neural activities in the cortex of mice enabled the determination of strength of sensory activation. Furthermore, an artificial intelligence-based neural activation parameter transformed Ca2+ bioluminescence signals to network activity patterns. During continuous Ca2+-bioluminescence recordings, visual cortical activity peaked at the seventh to eighth hour of anesthesia, coinciding with circadian rhythm. For both direct optogenetic stimulation in cortical slices and visually evoked activities in the visual cortex, we observed secondary delayed Ca2+-bioluminescence responses, suggesting the involvement of neuron-astrocyte-neuron pathway. Our approach will enable the development of a modular and scalable interface system capable of serving a multiplicity of applications to modulate and monitor large-scale activities in the brain.", "To analyze the rule of traditional Chinese medicine in the treatment of acute pancreatitis (AP).\nUsing machine learning technology and artificial intelligence, we collected 516 traditional Chinese medicine compounds for treating AP in the recent past 20 years, and analyzed the application of Chinese medicine in the field of AP. The data set was established by the ingredients of each prescription and its corresponding effectiveness. 90% of the data was divided into the training set, and the remaining 10% of the data was used as the test set. We employed random forest method to build a model to predict the efficacy of the prescriptions in the treatment of AP. The R-squared score and mean absolute error was used to evaluate the model's performance.\nThe most frequently used drugs were rhubarb, Radix Bupleuri, Fructus Aurantii Immaturus, and Mirabilite. Rhubarb and Rhizoma Corydalis had the greatest curative effect. The random forest model that fit all data showed that its R-squared score reached 0.8021. And the results predicted on the test set showed that the R-squared score reached 0.7318.\nSoothing the liver, promoting qi, clearing heat, removing obstructions of organs, activating blood, and resolving stagnation are the treatment methods for AP.", "COVID-19 frequently provokes pneumonia, which can be diagnosed using imaging exams. Chest X-ray (CXR) is often useful because it is cheap, fast, widespread, and uses less radiation. Here, we demonstrate the impact of lung segmentation in COVID-19 identification using CXR images and evaluate which contents of the image influenced the most. Semantic segmentation was performed using a U-Net CNN architecture, and the classification using three CNN architectures (VGG, ResNet, and Inception). Explainable Artificial Intelligence techniques were employed to estimate the impact of segmentation. A three-classes database was composed: lung opacity (pneumonia), COVID-19, and normal. We assessed the impact of creating a CXR image database from different sources, and the COVID-19 generalization from one source to another. The segmentation achieved a Jaccard distance of 0.034 and a Dice coefficient of 0.982. The classification using segmented images achieved an F1-Score of 0.88 for the multi-class setup, and 0.83 for COVID-19 identification. In the cross-dataset scenario, we obtained an F1-Score of 0.74 and an area under the ROC curve of 0.9 for COVID-19 identification using segmented images. Experiments support the conclusion that even after segmentation, there is a strong bias introduced by underlying factors from different sources.", "An extension of neo-Darwinism, termed preassembly, states that genetic material required for many complex traits, such as echolocation, was present long before emergence of the traits. Assembly of genes and gene segments had occurred over protracted time-periods within large libraries of non-coding genes. Epigenetic factors ultimately promoted transfers from noncoding to coding genes, leading to abrupt formation of the trait via de novo genes. This preassembly model explains many observations that to this present day still puzzle biologists: formation of super-complexity in the absence of multiple fossil precursors, as with bat echolocation and flowering plants; major genetic and physical alterations occurring in just a few thousand years, as with housecat evolution; lack of precursors preceding lush periods of species expansion, as in the Cambrian explosion; and evolution of costly traits that exceed their need during evolutionary times, as with human intelligence. What follows in this paper is a mechanism that is not meant to supplant neo-Darwinism; instead, preassembly aims to supplement current ideas when complexity issues leave them struggling.", "Acute kidney injury (AKI) affects nearly 60% of all patients admitted to ICUs. Large volumes of clinical, monitoring and laboratory data produced in ICUs allow the application of artificial intelligence analytics. The purpose of this article is to assimilate and critically evaluate recently published literature regarding artificial intelligence applications for predicting, diagnosing and subphenotyping AKI among critically ill patients.\nAmong recent studies regarding artificial intelligence implementations for predicting, diagnosing and subphenotyping AKI among critically ill patients, there are many promising models, but few had external validation, clinical interpretability and high predictive performance. Deep learning techniques leveraging multimodal clinical data show great potential to provide continuous, accurate, early predictions of AKI risk, which could be implemented clinically to optimize preventive and early therapeutic management strategies.\nUse of consensus criteria, standard definitions and common data models could facilitate access to machine learning-ready data sets for external validation. The lack of interpretability, explainability, fairness and transparency of artificial intelligence models hinder their entrustment and clinical implementation; compliance with standardized reporting guidelines can mitigate these challenges.", "Medicine is heading towards personalized care based on individual situations and conditions. With smartphones and increasingly miniaturized wearable devices, the sensors available on these devices can perform long-term continuous monitoring of several user health-related parameters, making them a powerful tool for a new medicine approach for these patients. Our proposed system, described in this article, aims to develop innovative solutions based on artificial intelligence techniques to empower patients with cardiovascular disease. These solutions will realize a novel 5P (Predictive, Preventive, Participatory, Personalized, and Precision) medicine approach by providing patients with personalized plans for treatment and increasing their ability for self-monitoring. Such capabilities will be derived by learning algorithms from physiological data and behavioral information, collected using wearables and smart devices worn by patients with health conditions. Further, developing an innovative system of smart algorithms will also focus on providing monitoring techniques, predicting extreme events, generating alarms with varying health parameters, and offering opportunities to maintain active engagement of patients in the healthcare process by promoting the adoption of healthy behaviors and well-being outcomes. The multiple features of this future system will increase the quality of life for cardiovascular diseases patients and provide seamless contact with a healthcare professional.", "To synthesize peer-reviewed evidence related to the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in surgical education DESIGN: We conducted and reported a scoping review according to the standards outlined in the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis with extension for Scoping Reviews guideline and the fourth edition of the Joanna Briggs Institute Reviewer's Manual. We systematically searched eight interdisciplinary databases including MEDLINE-Ovid, ERIC, EMBASE, CINAHL, Web of Science: Core Collection, Compendex, Scopus, and IEEE Xplore. Databases were searched from inception until the date of search on April 13, 2021.\nWe only examined original, peer-reviewed interventional studies that self-described as AI interventions, focused on medical education, and were relevant to surgical trainees (defined as medical or dental students, postgraduate residents, or surgical fellows) within the title and abstract (see Table 2). Animal, cadaveric, and in vivo studies were not eligible for inclusion.\nAfter systematically searching eight databases and 4255 citations, our scoping review identified 49 studies relevant to artificial intelligence in surgical education. We found diverse interventions related to the evaluation of surgical competency, personalization of surgical education, and improvement of surgical education materials across surgical specialties. Many studies used existing surgical education materials, such as the Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills framework or the JHU-ISI Gesture and Skill Assessment Working Set database. Though most studies did not provide outcomes related to the implementation in medical schools (such as cost-effective analyses or trainee feedback), there are numerous promising interventions. In particular, many studies noted high accuracy in the objective characterization of surgical skill sets. These interventions could be further used to identify at-risk surgical trainees or evaluate teaching methods.\nThere are promising applications for AI in surgical education, particularly for the assessment of surgical competencies, though further evidence is needed regarding implementation and applicability.", "In healthcare, a multitude of data is collected from medical sensors and devices, such as X-ray machines, magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography (CT), and so on, that can be analyzed by artificial intelligence methods for early diagnosis of diseases. Recently, the outbreak of the COVID-19 disease caused many deaths. Computer vision researchers support medical doctors by employing deep learning techniques on medical images to diagnose COVID-19 patients. Various methods were proposed for COVID-19 case classification. A new automated technique is proposed using parallel fusion and optimization of deep learning models. The proposed technique starts with a contrast enhancement using a combination of top-hat and Wiener filters. Two pre-trained deep learning models (AlexNet and VGG16) are employed and fine-tuned according to target classes (COVID-19 and healthy). Features are extracted and fused using a parallel fusion approach-parallel positive correlation. Optimal features are selected using the entropy-controlled firefly optimization method. The selected features are classified using machine learning classifiers such as multiclass support vector machine (MC-SVM). Experiments were carried out using the Radiopaedia database and achieved an accuracy of 98%. Moreover, a detailed analysis is conducted and shows the improved performance of the proposed scheme.", "Emotional intelligence has been considered an important construct by schools and universities because of its theoretical importance and practical implications. Considerable resources and time have been spent by the educational institutions to develop the emotional skills of their students. The present meta-analysis aimed at studying the relationship of emotional intelligence, including its three theoretical models, with academic performance while accounting for age and gender as moderators. \"Robumeta\" package was used for the meta-analysis of multilevel random effects with robust variance estimation (RVE) in R version 4.0.3. Effect sizes were calculated and meta-regression analysis with RVE was used to assess the relationship with the moderator variables. A positive and significant overall relationship was found between emotional intelligence and academic performance (\u03c1\u00a0=\u00a00.19). The moderating effect of emotional intelligence with gender streams on emotional intelligence and academic performance's relationship was examined through meta-regression with robust variance estimation and sub-group analyses. Whereas the relationship between emotional intelligence and academic performance was not found to be moderated by age, it was found to be partially mediated by gender.", "Background: Diagnosing pediatric appendicitis by ultrasonography (US) is difficult because US requires significant training and skill. We evaluated whether artificial intelligence (AI) can augment US. Materials and Methods: Among 70 abdominal ultrasound videos containing 85-347 images each, 50 were used to train the AI neural network. Each video was categorized based on the detection percentage and percent accuracy: most (>50%), partial (10-50%), and none (<10%). Test 1 involved verification of appendix detection by AI using the remaining 20 videos. Test 2 involved the evaluation of the effect of AI utilization on pediatricians. Results: From 50 videos, 6914 images were used to train the AI network. In test 1, 3 pediatric surgeons judged 10 (50.0%), 4 (20.0%), and 6 (30.0%) videos as \"most,\" \"partial,\" and \"none,\" respectively, regarding the detection percentage; 7 (35.0%), 7 (35.0%), and 6 (30.0%) videos were judged, respectively, concerning the percent accuracy. Five (83.3%) of six test videos with a scan area depth of 8\u2009cm were judged as \"none\" for both detection and accuracy. In test 2, six videos were also judged as \"none\" for both categories, showing a negative effect on the participants (5 pediatric residents and 5 pediatric intensive-emergency fellows), but the other categories showed little negative effect. Conclusions: Appendicitis in a shallow US scan area can be easily identified with AI support. Even with the detection of a partial appendicitis shadow, AI is still helpful. However, if AI does not detect appendicitis at all, examiners may be negatively affected.", "The quantification of human brain functional (re)configurations across varying cognitive demands remains an unresolved topic. We propose that such functional configurations may be categorized into three different types: (a) network configural breadth, (b) task-to task transitional reconfiguration, and (c) within-task reconfiguration. Such functional reconfigurations are rather subtle at the whole-brain level. Hence, we propose a mesoscopic framework focused on functional networks (FNs) or communities to quantify functional (re)configurations. To do so, we introduce a 2D network morphospace that relies on two novel mesoscopic metrics, trapping efficiency (TE) and exit entropy (EE), which capture topology and integration of information within and between a reference set of FNs. We use this framework to quantify the network configural breadth across different tasks. We show that the metrics defining this morphospace can differentiate FNs, cognitive tasks, and subjects. We also show that network configural breadth significantly predicts behavioral measures, such as episodic memory, verbal episodic memory, fluid intelligence, and general intelligence. In essence, we put forth a framework to explore the cognitive space in a comprehensive manner, for each individual separately, and at different levels of granularity. This tool that can also quantify the FN reconfigurations that result from the brain switching between mental states.", "Recently, artificial intelligence has been successfully used in fields, such as computer vision, voice, and big data analysis. However, various problems, such as security, privacy, and ethics, also occur owing to the development of artificial intelligence. One such problem are deepfakes. Deepfake is a compound word for deep learning and fake. It refers to a fake video created using artificial intelligence technology or the production process itself. Deepfakes can be exploited for political abuse, pornography, and fake information. This paper proposes a method to determine integrity by analyzing the computer vision features of digital content. The proposed method extracts the rate of change in the computer vision features of adjacent frames and then checks whether the video is manipulated. The test demonstrated the highest detection rate of 97% compared to the existing method or machine learning method. It also maintained the highest detection rate of 96%, even for the test that manipulates the matrix of the image to avoid the convolutional neural network detection method.", "The speed and accuracy of phenotype detection from medical images are some of the most important qualities needed for any informed and timely response such as early detection of cancer or detection of desirable phenotypes for animal breeding. To improve both these qualities, the world is leveraging artificial intelligence and machine learning against this challenge. Most recently, deep learning has successfully been applied to the medical field to improve detection accuracies and speed for conditions including cancer and COVID-19. In this study, we applied deep neural networks, in the form of a generative adversarial network (GAN), to perform image-to-image processing steps needed for ovine phenotype analysis from CT scans of sheep. Key phenotypes such as gigot geometry and tissue distribution were determined using a computer vision (CV) pipeline. The results of the image processing using a trained GAN are strikingly similar (a similarity index of 98%) when used on unseen test images. The combined GAN-CV pipeline was able to process and determine the phenotypes at a speed of 0.11 s per medical image compared to approximately 30 min for manual processing. We hope this pipeline represents the first step towards automated phenotype extraction for ovine genetic breeding programmes.", "The long-awaited progress in digitalisation is generating huge amounts of medical data every day, and manual analysis and targeted, patient-oriented evaluation of this data is becoming increasingly difficult or even infeasible. This state of affairs and the associated, increasingly complex requirements for individualised precision medicine underline the need for modern software solutions and algorithms across the entire healthcare system. The utilisation of state-of-the-art equipment and techniques in almost all areas of medicine over the past few years has now indeed enabled automation processes to enter - at least in part - into routine clinical practice. Such systems utilise a wide variety of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, the majority of which have been developed to optimise medical image reconstruction, noise reduction, quality assurance, triage, segmentation, computer-aided detection and classification and, as an emerging field of research, radiogenomics. Tasks handled by AI are completed significantly faster and more precisely, clearly demonstrated by now in the annual findings of the ImageNet Large-Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVCR), first conducted in 2015, with error rates well below those of humans. This review article will discuss the potential capabilities and currently available applications of AI in gynaecological-obstetric diagnostics. The article will focus, in particular, on automated techniques in prenatal sonographic diagnostics.", "This study was to explore the application value of chest computed tomography (CT) images processed by artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms in the diagnosis of neonatal bronchial pneumonia (NBP). The AI adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction (ASiR) algorithm was adopted to reconstruct the chest CT image to compare and analyze the effect of the reconstruction of CT image under the ASiR algorithm under different preweight and postweight values based on the objective measurement and subjective evaluation. 85 neonates with pneumonia treated in hospital from September 1, 2015, to July 1, 2020, were selected as the research objects to analyze their CT imaging characteristics. Subsequently, the peripheral blood of healthy neonates during the same period was collected, and the levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) were detected. The efficiency of CT examination, CRP, ESR, and combined examination in the diagnosis of NBP was analyzed. The results showed that the subjective quality score, lung window subjective score, and mediastinal window subjective score were the highest after CT image reconstruction when the preweight value of the ASiR algorithm was 50%. After treatment, 79 NBP cases (92.9%) showed ground-glass features in CT images. Compared with the healthy neonates, the levels of CRP and ESR in the peripheral blood of neonates with bronchial pneumonia were much lower (P < 0.05). The accuracy rates of CT examination, CRP examination, ESR examination, CRP\u2009+\u2009ESR examination, and CRP\u2009+\u2009ESR\u2009+\u2009CT examination for the diagnosis of NBP were 80.7%, 75.3%, 75.1%, 80.3%, and 98.6%, respectively. CT technology based on AI algorithm showed high clinical application value in the feature analysis of NBP.", "In 2019, the US Government announced its goal to end the HIV epidemic within 10 years, mirroring the initiatives set forth by UNAIDS. Public health prevention interventions are a crucial part of this ambitious goal. However, numerous challenges to this goal exist, including improving HIV awareness, increasing early HIV infection detection, ensuring rapid treatment, optimising resource distribution, and providing efficient prevention services for vulnerable populations. Artificial intelligence has had a pivotal role in revolutionising health care and has shown great potential in developing effective HIV prevention intervention strategies. Although artificial intelligence has been used in a few HIV prevention intervention areas, there are challenges to address and opportunities to explore.", "The shift in the way how health care is delivered from exclusive (disciplinary) to a more collective and inclusive (interprofessional) has recently been gaining traction in health care. The need for this shift is even magnified when the health care system face unprecedented challenges that single expertise is no more enough. The promise of transformative power of collaboration in health care suggests that collective intelligence achieves tasks more effectively than a single expertise could achieve.", "Although social cognitive deficits were found in euthymic patients of bipolar disorder (BD), the characteristics of social cognition in Han Chinese euthymic BD patients remain obscure. This study aimed to examine social cognition in Han Chinese euthymic BD patients relative to healthy controls (HC). Moreover, we explore the differences in social cognition between euthymic BD I and BD II patients.\n43 Han Chinese BD patients (BD-I:25, BD-II:18) and 28 HC were recruited. All patients were euthymic (Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS)\u00a0\u2264\u00a07 and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS)\u00a0\u2264\u00a07). Social cognitive ability was measured using Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test (MSCEIT), including 4 branches: perceiving emotions, facilitating emotions, understanding emotions, and managing emotions. Continuous performance Test (CPT) and Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) were used to examine attention and executive function.\nSignificant difference in understanding emotions branch of MSCEIT was found between BD patients and HCs (Mann-Whitney U test, p\u00a0=\u00a00.005). Besides, BD patients had significantly worse performance in WCST and CPT. However, the differences in WCST, CPT, MSCEIT total scores and its subscales were not significant between BD I and BD II patients.\nEuthymic Han Chinese BD patients exhibit significant social cognitive deficits in understanding emotion and cognitive dysfunction in attention and executive function. Furthermore, Han Chinese BD I patients showed similar social cognitive and general cognitive ability as compared with BD II patients. Social cognitive rehabilitation on both euthymic BD I and II patients should be considered.", "Accurate risk assessment is essential for the success of population screening programs in breast cancer. Models with high sensitivity and specificity would enable programs to target more elaborate screening efforts to high-risk populations, while minimizing overtreatment for the rest. Artificial intelligence (AI)-based risk models have demonstrated a significant advance over risk models used today in clinical practice. However, the responsible deployment of novel AI requires careful validation across diverse populations. To this end, we validate our AI-based model, Mirai, across globally diverse screening populations.\nWe collected screening mammograms and pathology-confirmed breast cancer outcomes from Massachusetts General Hospital, USA; Novant, USA; Emory, USA; Maccabi-Assuta, Israel; Karolinska, Sweden; Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taiwan; and Barretos, Brazil. We evaluated Uno's concordance index for Mirai in predicting risk of breast cancer at one to five years from the mammogram.\nA total of 128,793 mammograms from 62,185 patients were collected across the seven sites, of which 3,815 were followed by a cancer diagnosis within 5 years. Mirai obtained concordance indices of 0.75 (95% CI, 0.72 to 0.78), 0.75 (95% CI, 0.70 to 0.80), 0.77 (95% CI, 0.75 to 0.79), 0.77 (95% CI, 0.73 to 0.81), 0.81 (95% CI, 0.79 to 0.82), 0.79 (95% CI, 0.76 to 0.83), and 0.84 (95% CI, 0.81 to 0.88) at Massachusetts General Hospital, Novant, Emory, Maccabi-Assuta, Karolinska, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, and Barretos, respectively.\nMirai, a mammography-based risk model, maintained its accuracy across globally diverse test sets from seven hospitals across five countries. This is the broadest validation to date of an AI-based breast cancer model and suggests that the technology can offer broad and equitable improvements in care.", "The incidence of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) continues to rise due to the improved survival of very low birth weight infants in developed countries. This epidemic is also fueled by increased survival of preterm babies with variable use of oxygen and a lack of ROP awareness and screening services in resource-limited regions. Improvements in technology and a basic understanding of the disease pathophysiology have changed the way we screen and manage ROP, educate providers and patients, and improve ROP awareness. Advancements in imaging techniques, expansion of telemedicine services, and the potential for artificial intelligence-assisted ROP screening programs have created opportunities to improve ROP care in areas with a shortage of ophthalmologists trained in ROP. To address the gap in provider knowledge regarding ROP, the Global Education Network for Retinopathy of Prematurity (GEN-ROP) created a web-based tele-education training module that can be used to educate all providers involved in ROP, including non-physician ROP screeners. Over the past 50 years, the treatment of severe ROP has evolved from limited treatment modalities to cryotherapy and laser photocoagulation. More recently, there has been growing evidence to support the use of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) agents for the treatment of severe ROP. However, VEGF is known to be important in organogenesis and microvascular maintenance, and given that intravitreal anti-VEGF treatment can result in systemic VEGF suppression over a period of at least 1-12 weeks, there are concerns regarding adverse effects and long-term ocular and systemic developmental consequences of anti-VEGF therapy. Future research in ophthalmology to address the growing burden of ROP should focus on cost-effective fundus imaging devices, implementation of artificial intelligence platforms, updated treatment algorithms with optimal use of anti-VEGF and careful investigation of its long-term effects, and surgical options in advanced ROP. Addressing these unmet needs will aid the global effort against the ROP epidemic and optimize our understanding and treatment of this blinding disease.", "Human errors cause accidents in the workplace. Screening workers at employment can prevent future accidents from happening. Two important tools that can be helpful in screening are determining the emotional intelligence score and personality traits score of the workers.\nThe purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationship between emotional intelligence, personality traits and safety behaviors in metal industries workers.\nThis is a cross-sectional survey. Confirmatory factor analysis was performed to determine the relationship between the components of emotional intelligence, unsafe behaviors, and personality. To collect data for this study, Five-Factor Goldberg questionnaire, Bar-On Emotional questionnaire and Safety behavior questionnaire were used. The collected data were entered into software (SPSS version 22) and refined.\nThe results of this study showed that there was a significant positive correlation between personality traits, emotional intelligence and safe behaviors (p-value\u200a=\u200a0.000). The confirmatory factor analysis showed that personality traits influence safe behaviours. Also, studies have shown that emotional intelligence has a positive effect on safe behaviours. The amount indicators of goodness of fit (GFI), Comparative Fit index (CFI), Tucker-Lewis index (TLI) and root mean square error approximation (RMSEA) were 0.944, 0.970, 0.965 and 0.061, respectively.\nThe results of this study suggest that personality traits and emotional intelligence influence safe behaviours in the workplace. Employers can use these two tools in the employment phase and prevent future human-related accidents.", "Increasing the level of emotional intelligence (EI) is seen as a strategy for improving both relational quality and efficiency at work. As of today, there was no validated Persian brief instrument for evaluating EI. To fill this gap, this article was aimed to investigate the validity and reliability of the Persian version of the Brief Emotional Intelligence Scale (BEIS-10).\nA methodological cross-sectional study was conducted among 201 Persian-speaking individuals. These individuals were selected from different parts of Iran using the convenience sampling method. Translation of the BEIS-10 was conducted by employed forward-backward method. Internal consistency was evaluated by Cronbach's \u03b1, and for test-retest reliability, the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was employed. The construct validity was investigated by confirmatory factor analysis (CFA).\nThe Persian version of BEIS-10 indicates a good test-retest reliability (ICC = 0.612, 95% confidence interval: 0.384 and 0.769) as well as internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.748, ranging from 0.359 to 0.868 for different domains). The construct validity was evaluated by CFA and five factors from ten items were confirmed and all goodness-of-fit-indices were in acceptable levels.\nThe article concludes that the Persian version of BEIS-10 in five factors from ten items was a reliable and valid instrument for measuring EI in the general population. As well, the article was suggesting that the Persian version of BEIS-10 may stand as a suitable alternative to time-consuming tools for EI measurement since this scale appears to be time-saving and applicable to Iranian society.", "Abnormalities in language processing, psychological distress, and subtle neurodevelopmental features called neurological soft signs (NSS) are expressed by people with dyslexia and those scoring highly on schizotypy. We investigated whether the expression of NSS, distress, and schizotypy predicted dyslexia status. Participants (N\u00a0=\u00a096, 48 dyslexic) selected to be age and sex matched, completed the Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire, General Health Questionnaire, Neurological Evaluation Scale, and the National Adult Reading Test (NART; a measure of verbal intelligence). Dyslexia status was predicted by higher total NSS and disorganized schizotypy scores in the absence of NART. However, even with the inclusion of NART, disorganized schizotypy remained a significant predictor. The findings suggest that disorganized features of schizotypy could be a significant factor for those with dyslexia. Conversely, more attention needs to be given to developmental language disorders in those who score highly on schizotypy.", "Due to the non-uniformity of bond stress distribution, the full bar development length should be tested to validate the development length of the reinforcing bar embedded in concretes. The current study proposed the design of a hybrid artificial intelligence (AI) model using integration of support vector regression (SVR) coupled with response surface method (RSM) for prediction of reinforcement bar development length. Two nonlinear calibrating processes are conducted, RSM is used to connect the input data on the hardening dataset in first stage while SVR is used for determining the nonlinear relation between the hardening dataset and the output development bar stress. 534 pull-out test observations on short unit bar length are used for the modeling. Several physical dimensional properties are incorporated as input attributes for the hybrid predictive model. Stand-alone AI models, empirical formulations, and design codes are used for validation. Parametric analysis is performed to investigate the sensitivity of RSM-SVR model toward as input variables. Results evidenced the capability of the proposed RSM-RVM model to approximate the non-linear relations between physical information and bar development length. The RSM-SVR model proved to be a reliable intelligence model for bar materials design. Additionally, the model was highly consistent in the calibration of the existing design codes for more reliability. In quantitative terms, RSM-SVR model attained minimum root mean square error (RMSE = 25.60 MPa), compared with for example ACI 318-14 modeling design (306.56 MPa) or stand-alone SVR model (90.95 MPa), over the testing phase. The bar development length formulation using RSM-SVR model showed the nonlinear relationship with respect to the influence of the input variables such as transvers bars in development region, reinforcing yield stress, and concrete compressive strength in normal domain.", "Purpose \u2003Only from reviewing applications, it is difficult to identify which applicants will be successful ophthalmology residents. The change of the USMLE Step 1 scoring to \"Pass/Fail\" removes another quantitative metric. We aimed to identify application attributes correlated with successful residency performance. This study also used artificial intelligence (AI) to evaluate letters of recommendation (LOR), the Dean's letter (MSPE), and personal statement (PS). Design \u2003Retrospective analysis of application characteristics versus residency performance was conducted. Participants \u2003Residents who graduated from the Dean McGee Eye Institute/University of Oklahoma Ophthalmology residency from 2004 to 2019 were included in this study. Methods \u2003Thirty-four attributes were recorded from each application. Residents were subjectively ranked into tertiles and top and bottom deciles based on residency performance by faculty present during their training. The Ophthalmic Knowledge Assessment Program (OKAP) examination scores were used as an objective performance metric. Analysis was performed to identify associations between application attributes and tertile/decile ranking. Additional analysis used AI and natural language processing to evaluate applicant LORs, MSPE, and PS. Main Outcome Measures \u2003Characteristics from residency applications that correlate with resident performance were the primary outcome of this study. Results \u2003Fifty-five residents and 21 faculty members were included. A grade of \"A\" or \"Honors\" in the obstetrics/gynecology (OB/GYN) clerkship and the presence of a home ophthalmology department were associated with ranking in the top tertile but not the top decile. Mean core clerkship grades, medical school ranking in the top 25 U.S. News and World Report (USNWR) primary care rankings, and postgraduate year (PGY)-2 and PGY-3 OKAP scores were predictive of being ranked in both the top tertile and the top decile. USMLE scores, alpha-omega-alpha (AOA) status, and number of publications did not correlate with subjective resident performance. AI analysis of LORs, MSPE, and PS did not identify any text features that correlated with resident performance. Conclusions \u2003Many metrics traditionally felt to be predictive of residency success (USMLE scores, AOA status, and research) did not predict resident success in our study. We did confirm the importance of core clerkship grades and medical school ranking. Objective measures of success such as PGY-2 and PGY-3 OKAP scores were associated with high subjective ranking.", "Youth experiencing homelessness (YEH) are at elevated risk of HIV/AIDS and disproportionately identify as racial, ethnic, sexual, and gender minorities. We developed a new peer change agent (PCA) HIV prevention intervention with 3 arms: (1) an arm using an artificial intelligence (AI) planning algorithm to select PCAs; (2) a popularity arm, the standard PCA approach, operationalized as highest degree centrality (DC); and (3) an observation-only comparison group.\nA total of 713 YEH were recruited from 3 drop-in centers in Los Angeles, CA.\nYouth consented and completed a baseline survey that collected self-reported data on HIV knowledge, condom use, and social network information. A quasi-experimental pretest/posttest design was used; 472 youth (66.5% retention at 1 month postbaseline) and 415 youth (58.5% retention at 3 months postbaseline) completed follow-up. In each intervention arm (AI and DC), 20% of youth was selected as PCAs and attended a 4-hour initial training, followed by 7 weeks of half-hour follow-up sessions. Youth disseminated messages promoting HIV knowledge and condom use.\nUsing generalized estimating equation models, there was a significant reduction over time (P < 0.001) and a significant time by AI arm interaction (P < 0.001) for condomless anal sex act. There was a significant increase in HIV knowledge over time among PCAs in DC and AI arms.\nPCA models that promote HIV knowledge and condom use are efficacious for YEH. Youth are able to serve as a bridge between interventionists and their community. Interventionists should consider working with computer scientists to solve implementation problems.", "Analyzing the relation between intelligence and neural activity is of the utmost importance in understanding the working principles of the human brain in health and disease. In existing literature, functional brain connectomes have been used successfully to predict cognitive measures such as intelligence quotient (IQ) scores in both healthy and disordered cohorts using machine learning models. However, existing methods resort to flattening the brain connectome (i.e., graph) through vectorization which overlooks its topological properties. To address this limitation and inspired from the emerging graph neural networks (GNNs), we design a novel regression GNN model (namely RegGNN) for predicting IQ scores from brain connectivity. On top of that, we introduce a novel, fully modular sample selection method to select the best samples to learn from for our target prediction task. However, since such deep learning architectures are computationally expensive to train, we further propose a learning-based sample selection method that learns how to choose the training samples with the highest expected predictive power on unseen samples. For this, we capitalize on the fact that connectomes (i.e., their adjacency matrices) lie in the symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrix cone. Our results on full-scale and verbal IQ prediction outperforms comparison methods in autism spectrum disorder cohorts and achieves a competitive performance for neurotypical subjects using 3-fold cross-validation. Furthermore, we show that our sample selection approach generalizes to other learning-based methods, which shows its usefulness beyond our GNN architecture.", "Pathology plays a very important role in cancer diagnosis. The rapid development of digital pathology (DP) based on whole slide image (WSI) has led to many improvements in computer-assisted diagnosis by artificial intelligence. The common digitization strategy is to scan the pathology slice with 20\u00d7 or 40\u00d7 objective, and the 40\u00d7 objective requires excessive storage space and transmission time, which are significant negative factors in the popularization of DP. In this article, we present a novel reconstructed high-resolution (HR) process based on deep learning to switch 20 \u00d7 WSI to 40 \u00d7 without the loss of whole and local features. Furthermore, we collected the WSI data of 100 uterine leiomyosarcomas and 100 adult granulosa cell tumors to test our reconstructed HR process. We tested the reconstructed HR WSI by the peak signal-to-noise ratio, structural similarity, and the blind/reject image spatial quality evaluator, which were 42.03, 0.99, and 49.22, respectively. Subsequently, we confirmed the consistency between the actual and our reconstructed HR images. The testing results indicate that the reconstructed HR imaging is a reliable method for the digital slides of a variety of tumors and can be available on a large scale in clinical pathology as an innovative technique.", "IVF techniques have changed over time with the aim of improving clinical results. Today, embryology is facing a change common to most areas of medicine, the introduction of automation. The use of automated systems in the IVF laboratory is already happening, for example, with electronic witnessing and the ranking of embryos according to their implantation potential. It is expected that in the near future, various systems in the IVF laboratory will be automated. In this way, gamete manipulation would cease to be manual and embryo culture and selection would be performed by means of microfluidics and artificial intelligence. Therefore, the tasks of the embryologist will inevitably be reduced. However, new functions related to data capture, management and analysis will emerge, along with other research skills and increased communication with other professionals and patients.", "We review the current applications of artificial intelligence (AI) in functional genomics. The recent explosion of AI follows the remarkable achievements made possible by \"deep learning\", along with a burst of \"big data\" that can meet its hunger. Biology is about to overthrow astronomy as the paradigmatic representative of big data producer. This has been made possible by huge advancements in the field of high throughput technologies, applied to determine how the individual components of a biological system work together to accomplish different processes. The disciplines contributing to this bulk of data are collectively known as functional genomics. They consist in studies of: i) the information contained in the DNA (genomics); ii) the modifications that DNA can reversibly undergo (epigenomics); iii) the RNA transcripts originated by a genome (transcriptomics); iv) the ensemble of chemical modifications decorating different types of RNA transcripts (epitranscriptomics); v) the products of protein-coding transcripts (proteomics); and vi) the small molecules produced from cell metabolism (metabolomics) present in an organism or system at a given time, in physiological or pathological conditions. After reviewing main applications of AI in functional genomics, we discuss important accompanying issues, including ethical, legal and economic issues and the importance of explainability.", "Green solvents (GS) in chromatography originate from green chemistry. Therefore, using GSs in liquid chromatographic analysis to separate drugs and chemicals is an emerging approach to reduce hazardous chemicals in nature. The\u00a0Orbit Intelligence database was used to conduct a strategic patent search for peer-reviewed patents on GSs as a mobile phase for chromatographic analysis. This article reported numerous approaches for encouraging GSs such as ethanol, butanol, esters, polyethylene glycol, supercritical fluids and nonionic surfactants to analyze drugs or compounds. The main aim of this article is to explore the patented GSs for chromatographic analysis and forecasting of the GSs that encourage industries to shift from hazardous to GSs.", "Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and S100B are reported to play an important role in neurodevelopment and may contribute to developmental pathogenesis in neuropsychiatric diseases. In this study, we aimed to examine the possible roles of BDNF and S100B in the pathogenesis of nonsyndromic intellectual disability (NS-ID) and their relationship with cognitive performance.\nThirty-three patients with intellectual disability (ID) and 30 typically developing children were compared. BDNF and S100B serum levels were measured with ELISA. The Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised Short form (WISC-R) and Leiter intelligence test were administered to determine the intelligence levels of subjects. Leiter intelligence test was applied to 10 participants (30.31%) in the ID group because they had speech and communication problems. All other participants underwent WISC-R.\nBrain-derived neurotrophic factor levels were found to be significantly low in the patient group (mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD, 67.43\u00a0\u00b1\u00a029.74\u00a0pg/mL) compared with the control group (94.67\u00a0\u00b1\u00a032.55\u00a0pg/mL) (P\u00a0=\u00a00.002). When S100B is assessed, there was no significant difference found between the patient group (335.05\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0279.89\u00a0pg/mL) and control group (295.30\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0146.55\u00a0pg/mL) (P\u00a0=\u00a00.901). There was a significant positive correlation between BDNF and performance IQ (r\u00a0=\u00a00.424 and P\u00a0=\u00a00.001) in all participants. In addition, positive correlations were found between BDNF levels and initiating speech time (r\u00a0=\u00a0-0.369 and P\u00a0=\u00a00.003).\nBrain-derived neurotrophic factor deficiency is proposed to have a possible role in the pathology of NS-ID. High BDNF levels may be associated with better cognitive performance.", "Treatment of infertility has evolved as understanding of reproduction has improved. Fertility promoting surgery still is performed and recent advances have broken new ground. Hormonal treatments to correct gonadal dysfunction have been developed, but multiple gestation continues to be a significant complication. Assisted reproductive technologies have improved such that in\u00a0vitro fertilization and its variants increasingly are used to treat nearly all causes of infertility. Advances in assisted reproduction are of 2 types: (1) incremental optimization of existing techniques and (2) development of new, disruptive technologies. Artificial intelligence and stem cell technologies are poised to have impact in the near future.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) is fast becoming the tool of choice for scalable and reliable analysis of medical images. However, constraints in sharing medical data outside the institutional or geographical space, as well as difficulties in getting AI models and modeling platforms to work across different environments, have led to a \"reproducibility crisis\" in digital medicine.\nThis study details the implementation of a web platform that can be used to mitigate these challenges by orchestrating a digital pathology AI pipeline, from raw data to model inference, entirely on the local machine. We discuss how this federated platform provides governed access to data by consuming the Application Program Interfaces exposed by cloud storage services, allows the addition of user-defined annotations, facilitates active learning for training models iteratively, and provides model inference computed directly in the web browser at practically zero cost. The latter is of particular relevance to clinical workflows because the code, including the AI model, travels to the user's data, which stays private to the governance domain where it was acquired.\nWe demonstrate that the web browser can be a means of democratizing AI and advancing data socialization in medical imaging backed by consumer-facing cloud infrastructure such as Box.com. As a case study, we test the accompanying platform end-to-end on a large dataset of digital breast cancer tissue microarray core images. We also showcase how it can be applied in contexts separate from digital pathology by applying it to a radiology dataset containing COVID-19 computed tomography images.\nThe platform described in this report resolves the challenges to the findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable stewardship of data and AI models by integrating with cloud storage to maintain user-centric governance over the data. It also enables distributed, federated computation for AI inference over those data and proves the viability of client-side AI in medical imaging.\nThe open-source application is publicly available at , with a short video demonstration at .", "Purpose.We have previously reported an artificial intelligence (AI) agent that automatically generates intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) plans via fluence map prediction, by-passing inverse planning. This AI agent achieved clinically comparable quality for prostate cases, but its performance on head-and-neck patients leaves room for improvement. This study aims to collect insights of the deep-learning-based (DL-based) fluence map prediction model by systematically analyzing its prediction errors.Methods.From the modeling perspective, the DL model's output is the fluence maps of IMRT plans. However, from the clinical planning perspective, the plan quality evaluation should be based on the clinical dosimetric criteria such as dose-volume histograms. To account for the complex and non-intuitive relationships between fluence map prediction errors and the corresponding dose distribution changes, we propose a novel error analysis approach that systematically examines plan dosimetric changes that are induced by varying amounts of fluence prediction errors. We investigated four decomposition modes of model prediction errors. The two spatial domain decompositions are based on fluence intensity and fluence gradient. The two frequency domain decompositions are based on Fourier-space banded frequency rings and Fourier-space truncated low-frequency disks. The decomposed error was analyzed for its impact on the resulting plans' dosimetric metrics. The analysis was conducted on 15 test cases spared from the 200 training and 16 validation cases used to train the model.Results.Most planning target volume metrics were significantly correlated with most error decompositions. The Fourier space disk radii had the largest Spearman's coefficients. The low-frequency region within a disk of \u223c20% Fourier space contained most of errors that impact overall plan quality.Conclusions.This study demonstrates the feasibility of using fluence map prediction error analysis to understand the AI agent's performance. Such insights will help fine-tune the DL models in architecture design and loss function selection.", "The aim of the study was to evaluate the performance of the Prophet forecasting procedure, part of the Facebook open-source Artificial Intelligence portfolio, for forecasting variations in radiological examination volumes. Daily CT and MRI examination volumes from our institution were extracted from the radiology information system (RIS) database. Data from January 1, 2015, to December 31, 2019, was used for training the Prophet algorithm, and data from January 2020 was used for validation. Algorithm performance was then evaluated prospectively in February and August 2020. Total error and mean error per day were evaluated, and computational time was logged using different Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) samples. Data from 610,570 examinations were used for training; the majority were CTs (82.3%). During retrospective testing, prediction error was reduced from 19 to\u2009<\u20091 per day in CT (total 589 to 17) and from 5 to\u2009<\u20091 per day (total 144 to 27) in MRI by fine-tuning the Prophet procedure. Prospective prediction error in February was 11 per day in CT (9934 predicted, 9667 actual) and 1 per day in MRI (2484 predicted, 2457 actual) and was significantly better than manual weekly predictions (p\u2009=\u20090.001). Inference with MCMC added no substantial improvements while vastly increasing computational time. Prophet accurately models weekly, seasonal, and overall trends paving the way for optimal resource allocation for radiology exam acquisition and interpretation.", "Swarm intelligence techniques have a vast range of real world applications.Some applications are in the domain of medical data mining where, main attention is on structure models for the classification and expectation of numerous diseases. These biomedical applications have grabbed the interest of numerous researchers because these are most serious and prevalent causes of death among the human whole world out of which breast cancer is the most serious issue. Mammography is the initial screening assessment of breast cancer. In this study, an enhanced version of Harris Hawks Optimization (HHO) approach has been developed for biomedical databases, known as DLHO. This approach has been introduced by integrating the merits of dimension learning-based hunting (DLH) search strategy with HHO. The main objective of this study is to alleviate the lack of crowd diversity, premature convergence of the HHO and the imbalance amid the exploration and exploitation. DLH search strategy utilizes a dissimilar method to paradigm a neighborhood for each search member in which the neighboring information can be shared amid search agents. This strategy helps in maintaining the diversity and the balance amid global and local search. To evaluate the DLHO lot of experiments have been taken such as (i) the performance of optimizers have analysed by using 29-CEC -2017 test suites, (ii) to demonstrate the effectiveness of the DLHO it has been tested on different biomedical databases out of which we have used two different databases for Breast i.e. MIAS and second database has been taken from the University of California at Irvine (UCI) Machine Learning Repository.Also to test the robustness of the proposed method its been tested on two other databases of such as Balloon and Heart taken from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. All the results are in the favour of the proposed technique.", "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a leading cause of dementia, and the current diagnostic methods of AD, such as positron emission tomography imaging, have a high cost and poor accessibility. Amyloid\u03b2 accumulates in the brain long before the symptomatic onset of AD, and can also be found in the inner retina. Anatomically and developmentally, the retina is an extension of the brain, and is the only part of the central nervous system that can be imaged non-invasively. Therefore, retinal imaging has potential as a potential biomarker for dementia. Previous studies have demonstrated that inner retinal thinning (measured using optical coherence tomography [OCT]) is associated with an increased risk of dementia, including AD. In addition, retinal vascular changes assessed using fundus photographs and OCT angiography were associated with dementia. We propose that artificial intelligence algorithms could be applied to process these retinal images and contribute to the automated interpretation of retinal images and screening for dementia. In addition, amyloid\u03b2 in the retina has been identified using hyperspectral imaging, a non-invasive retinal imaging, as a surrogate marker of brain amyloid\u03b2. Retinal imaging may provide a novel biomarker and contribute to screening individuals at risk of dementia, monitoring disease progression, and assessing therapeutic efficacy.", "Atrial fibrillation is a paroxysmal heart disease without any obvious symptoms for most people during the onset. The electrocardiogram (ECG) at the time other than the onset of this disease is not significantly different from that of normal people, which makes it difficult to detect and diagnose. However, if atrial fibrillation is not detected and treated early, it tends to worsen the condition and increase the possibility of stroke. In this paper, P-wave morphology parameters and heart rate variability feature parameters were simultaneously extracted from the ECG. A total of 31 parameters were used as input variables to perform the modeling of artificial intelligence ensemble learning model.\nThis paper applied three artificial intelligence ensemble learning methods, namely Bagging ensemble learning method, AdaBoost ensemble learning method, and Stacking ensemble learning method. The prediction results of these three artificial intelligence ensemble learning methods were compared. As a result of the comparison, the Stacking ensemble learning method combined with various models finally obtained the best prediction effect with the accuracy of 92%, sensitivity of 88%, specificity of 96%, positive predictive value of 95.7%, negative predictive value of 88.9%, F1 score of 0.9231 and area under receiver operating characteristic curve value of 0.911.\nIn feature extraction, this paper combined P-wave morphology parameters and heart rate variability parameters as input parameters for model training, and validated the value of the proposed parameters combination for the improvement of the model's predicting effect. In the calculation of the P-wave morphology parameters, the hybrid Taguchi-genetic algorithm was used to obtain more accurate Gaussian function fitting parameters. The prediction model was trained using the Stacking ensemble learning method, so that the model accuracy had better results, which can further improve the early prediction of atrial fibrillation.", "This study aimed to investigate the application of infrared thermal imaging and adopt deep learning to detect air leakage for determining the fitness of respirators during fit-checks.\nThe outbreak of Covid-19 virus constitutes a public health crisis with substantial resultant morbidities and mortalities; has exerted profound impacts.\nThis was a prospective observational study, employing a non-probability sampling method on a convenience sample to recruit the participants and followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology statement guidelines.\nThe use of infrared thermal imaging identified air leakage points as a disruption to the facial thermal pattern distribution at (a) front of face; (b) right lateral of the face; (c) left lateral of the face; (d) top of the facemask with the head facing down; and (e) bottom of the facemask with the head facing up. Results also indicated that artificial intelligence tools and the proliferation of deep learning have the potential to detect the location of air leakage locations.\nThe use of infrared thermal imaging provides evidence of the feasibility and applicability of infrared thermal imaging techniques in detecting air leakage for individuals wearing respirators.\nThe use of infrared thermal technology can serve a potential role in complement fit-checking of respiratory protective devices and offers promising practical utility in determining the fitness of respirators for nurses at the frontline to protect against the air-borne viruses.", "This study aimed to identify patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) by developing different machine learning (ML) models based on tryptophan hydroxylase-2 (TPH2) methylation and environmental stress.\nThe data were collected from 291 patients with MDD and 100 healthy control participants: individual basic information, the Negative Life Events Scale (NLES) scores, the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) scores and the methylation level at 38 CpG sites in TPH2. Information gain was used to select critical input variables. Support vector machine (SVM), back propagation neural network (BPNN) and random forest (RF) algorithms were used to build recognition models, which were evaluated by the 10-fold cross-validation. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method was used to evaluate features importance.\nGender, NLES scores, CTQ scores and 13 CpG sites in TPH2 gene were considered as predictors in the models. Three ML algorithms showed satisfactory performance in predicting MDD and the BPNN model indicated best prediction effects.\nML models with TPH2 methylation and environmental stress were identified to possess great performance in identifying patients with MDD, which provided precious experience for artificial intelligence to assist traditional diagnostic methods in the future.", "Quality control is a key process designed to ensure that only products satisfying the defined quality requirements reach the end consumer or the next step in a production line. In the food industry, in the packaging step, there are many products that are still evaluated by human operators. To automate the process and improve efficiency and effectiveness, computer vision and artificial intelligence techniques can be applied. This automation is challenging since specific strategies designed according to the application scenario are required. Focusing on the quality control of the sealing and closure of matrix-shaped thermoforming food packages, the aim of the article is to propose a deep-learning-based solution designed to automatically perform the quality control while satisfying production cadence and ensuring 100% inline inspection of the products. Particularly, the designed computer vision system and the image-based criteria defined to determine when a product has to be accepted or rejected are presented. In addition, the vision control software is described with special emphasis on the different convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures that have been considered (ResNet18, ResNet50, Vgg19 and DenseNet161, non-pre-trained and pre-trained on ImageNet) and on the specifically designed dataset. To test the solution, different experiments are carried out in the laboratory and also in a real scenario, concluding that the proposed CNN-based approach improves the efficiency and security of the quality control process. Optimal results are obtained with the pre-trained DenseNet161, achieving false positive rates that range from 0.03 to 0.30% and false negative rates that range from 0 to 0.07%, with a rejection rate between 0.64 and 5.09% of production, and being able to detect at least 99.93% of the sealing defects that occur in any production. The modular design of our solution as well as the provided description allow it to adapt to similar scenarios and to new deep-learning models to prevent the arrival of faulty products to end consumers by removing them from the automated production line.", "The search for effective drugs to treat new and existing diseases is a laborious one requiring a large investment of capital, resources, and time. The coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has been a painful reminder of the lack of development of new antimicrobial agents to treat emerging infectious diseases. Artificial intelligence (AI) and other in silico techniques can drive a more efficient, cost-friendly approach to drug discovery by helping move potential candidates with better clinical tolerance forward in the pipeline. Several research teams have developed successful AI platforms for hit identification, lead generation, and lead optimization. In this review, we investigate the technologies at the forefront of spearheading an AI revolution in drug discovery and pharmaceutical sciences.", "Emotional intelligence (EI) is associated with job success in multiple fields, in part, because\u00a0EI may mitigate stress and burnout. Research suggests these relationships may include teaching. Our purpose is to further explore the relationships between EI, burnout, and teaching for faculty surgeons.\nWith IRB approval, surgical faculty were offered the opportunity to complete personal demographics, the Maslach Burnout Inventory, the SETQ-SMART assessment of teaching ability, and the SEF:MED self-assessment of emotional intelligence. Surgical residents rated faculty teaching ability using the SETQ-SMART SETTING: A medium-sized academic medical center in the Southeast approved to graduate 6 residents per year.\nACGME surgical faculty and general surgical residents PGY1 to PGY5 including preliminary residents, were given the opportunity to participate.\nFaculty self-assessed teaching scores were significantly different from resident scores for nine (60%) faculty; three (33%) overrated their and 6 (67%) under rated their overall teaching ability, relative to resident ratings. The 3 SEF:MED scales correlated low-moderate to strongly with the SETQ-OTS: IS (r\u202f=\u202f0.41, p\u202f=\u202f0.13), EM (r\u202f=\u202f0.67, p < 0.01), and EA (r\u202f=\u202f0.43, p\u202f=\u202f0.11). Overall, 8(53%) faculty scored moderate to high on at least 1 of the 3 MBI subscales. Overall self-rated faculty teaching scores correlated negatively with higher EE and DP and positively with PA (r\u202f=\u202f-0.08, -0.21, and 0.52, p\u202f=\u202f0.047; respectively). EI negatively correlated with MBI-EE and DP and positively with PA (r\u202f=\u202f-0.31, -0.18, 0.45, respectively), though due to the small sample none reach statistical significance with alpha set to 0.05.\nIn this pilot study, EI is positively correlated to surgical faculty members' teaching ability. Burnout was less strongly correlated with resident-assessed faculty teaching scores, but with similar trends. Finally, EI was correlated with MBI EE, DP, and PA as expected given the literature in other fields. Expanded study is warranted.", "The popularization of social media has led to the coalescing of user groups around mental health conditions; in particular, depression. Social media offers a rich environment for contextualizing and predicting users' self-reported burden of depression. Modern artificial intelligence (AI) methods are commonly employed in analyzing user-generated sentiment on social media. In the forthcoming systematic review, we will examine the content validity of these computer-based health surveillance models with respect to standard diagnostic frameworks. Drawing from a clinical perspective, we will attempt to establish a normative judgment about the strengths of these modern AI applications in the detection of depression.\nWe will perform a systematic review of English and German language publications from 2010 to 2020 in PubMed, APA PsychInfo, Science Direct, EMBASE Psych, Google Scholar, and Web of Science. The inclusion criteria span cohort, case-control, cross-sectional studies, randomized controlled studies, in addition to reports on conference proceedings. The systematic review will exclude some gray source materials, specifically editorials, newspaper articles, and blog posts. Our primary outcome is self-reported depression, as expressed on social media. Secondary outcomes will be the types of AI methods used for social media depression screen, and the clinical validation procedures accompanying these methods. In a second step, we will utilize the evidence-strengthening Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcomes, Study type (PICOS) tool to refine our inclusion and exclusion criteria. Following the independent assessment of the evidence sources by two authors for the risk of bias, the data extraction process will culminate in a thematic synthesis of reviewed studies.\nWe present the protocol for a systematic review which will consider all existing literature from peer reviewed publication sources relevant to the primary and secondary outcomes. The completed review will discuss depression as a self-reported health outcome in social media material. We will examine the computational methods, including AI and machine learning techniques which are commonly used for online depression surveillance. Furthermore, we will focus on standard clinical assessments, as indicating content validity, in the design of the algorithms. The methodological quality of the clinical construct of the algorithms will be evaluated with the COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health status Measurement Instruments (COSMIN) framework. We conclude the study with a normative judgment about the current application of AI to screen for depression on social media.\nInternational Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews PROSPERO (registration number CRD42020187874).", "Heart sound measurement is crucial for analyzing and diagnosing patients with heart diseases. This study employed phonocardiogram signals as the input signal for heart disease analysis due to the accessibility of the respective method. This study referenced preprocessing techniques proposed by other researchers for the conversion of phonocardiogram signals into characteristic images composed using frequency subband. Image recognition was then conducted through the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), in order to classify the predicted of phonocardiogram signals as normal or abnormal. However, CNN requires the tuning of multiple hyperparameters, which entails an optimization problem for the hyperparameters in the model. To maximize CNN robustness, the uniform experiment design method and a science-based methodical experiment design were used to optimize CNN hyperparameters in this study.\nAn artificial intelligence prediction model was constructed using CNN, and the uniform experiment design method was proposed to acquire hyperparameters for optimal CNN robustness. The results indicate Filters ([Formula: see text]), Stride ([Formula: see text]), Activation functions ([Formula: see text]), and Dropout ([Formula: see text]) to be significant factors considerably influencing the ability of CNN to distinguish among heart sound states. Finally, the confirmation experiment was conducted, and the hyperparameter combination for optimal model robustness was Filters ([Formula: see text])\u2009=\u200932, Kernel Size ([Formula: see text] = 3\u2009\u00d7\u20093, Stride ([Formula: see text])\u2009=\u2009(1,1), Padding ([Formula: see text] as same, Optimizer ([Formula: see text] as the stochastic gradient descent, Activation functions ([Formula: see text]) as relu, and Dropout ([Formula: see text])\u2009=\u20090.544. With this combination of parameters, the model had an average prediction accuracy rate of 0.787 and standard deviation of 0.\nIn this study, phonocardiogram signals were used for the early prediction of heart diseases. The science-based and methodical uniform experiment design was used for the optimization of CNN hyperparameters to construct a CNN with optimal robustness. The results revealed that the constructed model exhibited robustness and an acceptable accuracy rate. Other literature has failed to address hyperparameter optimization problems in CNN; a method is subsequently proposed for robust CNN optimization, thereby solving this problem.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) has enormous potential to support clinical routine workflows and therefore is gaining increasing popularity among medical professionals. In the field of gastroenterology, investigations on AI and computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems have mainly focused on the lower gastrointestinal (GI) tract. However, numerous CAD tools have been tested also in upper GI disorders showing encouraging results. The main application of AI in the upper GI tract is endoscopy; however, the need to analyze increasing loads of numerical and categorical data in short times has pushed researchers to investigate applications of AI systems in other upper GI settings, including gastroesophageal reflux disease, eosinophilic esophagitis, and motility disorders. AI and CAD systems will be increasingly incorporated into daily clinical practice in the coming years, thus at least basic notions will be soon required among physicians. For noninsiders, the working principles and potential of AI may be as fascinating as obscure. Accordingly, we reviewed systematic reviews, meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials, and original research articles regarding the performance of AI in the diagnosis of both malignant and benign esophageal and gastric diseases, also discussing essential characteristics of AI.", "Patients with chest pain and persistent ST segment elevation (STE) may not have acute coronary occlusions or serum troponin curves suggestive of acute necrosis. Our objective is the validation and cost-effectiveness analysis of a diagnostic model assisted by artificial intelligence (AI).\nProspective multicenter registry in two groups of patients with STE: I) coronary arteries without significant lesions and without serum troponin curve suggestive of acute necrosis, II) myocardial infarction with acute coronary occlusion. The inclusion criteria are the following: 1) age\u00a0\u2265\u00a018\u00a0years, 2) chest pain or symptoms suggestive of myocardial ischemia, 3) STE at point J in two contiguous leads \u22650.1\u00a0mV, in V2 and V3\u00a0\u2265\u00a00,2\u00a0mV and 4) signature of informed consent. The exclusion criteria are the following: 1) left bundle branch block, 2) acute cardiac necrosis in the absence of significant epicardial coronary artery stenosis, 3) STE\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.1\u00a0mV with pathologic Q wave, 4) severe anemia (hemoglobin <8.0\u00a0g/dl). For each patient without acute cardiac necrosis, the next patient from that center of the same sex and similar age (\u00b1 5\u00a0years) with myocardial infarction and acute coronary occlusion will be included. A manual centralized electrocardiographic analysis and another by deep learning AI will be performed.\nThe results of the study will provide new information for the stratification of patients with STE. Our hypothesis is that an AI analysis of the surface electrocardiogram allows a better distinction of patients with STE due to acute myocardial ischemia, from those with another etiology.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) made it achievable that aortic dilation could be measured in CT images indirectly, while aortic diameter (AD) has the certain relationship with blood pressure. It was potential that the blood pressure condition be determined by AD measurement using the data obtained from a CT scanning especially in identifying masked hypertension and predicting the risk of poor control of blood pressure (BP) which was easy to elude diagnosis in clinic. We aimed to evaluate the possibility of utilizing AD by AI for predicting the risk of adverse BP status (including masked hypertension or poor BP control) and the optimal thoracic aortic position in measurement as well as the cutoff value for predicting the risk.\nEight hundred and one patients were enrolled in our study. AI-Rad Companion Cardiovascular (K183268 FDA approved) was used to perform automatic aorta measurement in thoracic CT images at nine key positions based on AHA guidelines. Data was post processed by software from AI-Rad Companion undergone rigorous clinical validation by both FDA and CE as verification of its efficacy and usability. The AD's risk and diagnostic value was assessed in identifying hypertension in the general population, in identifying the poor BP controlled in the hypertension population, and in screening masked hypertension in the general population respectively by multiple regression analysis and receiver operating curve analysis.\nAD measured by AI was a risk factor for adverse BP status after clinical covariates adjustment (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.02\u00a0~\u00a01.26). The AD at mid descending aorta was mostly affected by BP particularly, which is optimal indicator in identifying hypertension in the general population (AUC\u00a0=\u00a00.73) and for screening masked hypertension (AUC\u00a0=\u00a00.78).\nUsing AI to measure the AD of the aorta, particularly at the position of mid descending aorta, is greatly valuable for identifying people with poor BP status. It will be possible to reveal more clinical information reflected by ordinary CT images and enrich the screening methods for hypertension, especially masked hypertension.PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARYHTN has a significant adverse effect on arterial deformation. BP and arterial dilation promote each other in a vicious circle. Arterial dilation may not be restricted by apparent fluctuations in BP and is objective evidence of an undesirable BP state. The accuracy of AD measurements by AI on chest CT images has been verified. There has not been the application of AD measurement by AI in the scene of poor BP status in clinical practice.In this study, we applied AI to measure the diameter of the aorta in nine consecutive positions. We explored the association between AD at various positions and BP levels and the possibility that AD in identifying poor BP status in different populations. We found that the AD at the MD is of great value in screening MH and evaluating the control state of BP in HTN. It will be possible to significantly expand the clinical information reflected by ordinary CT images and enrich the screening methods for HTN, especially MH.", "The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic continues to spread sporadically in the Unites States and worldwide. The severity and mortality excessively affected the frail elderly with co-existing medical diseases. There is growing evidence that cross-talk between the gut microbiome, Vitamin D and RAS/ACE2 system is essential for a balanced functioning of the elderly immune system and in regulating inflammation. In this review, we hypothesize that the state of gut microbiome, prior to infection determines the outcome associated with COVID-19 sepsis and may also be a critical factor in success to vaccination.\nArticles from PubMed/Medline searches were reviewed using a combination of terms \"SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, Inflammaging, Immune-senescence, Gut microbiome, Vitamin D, RAS/ACE2, Vaccination\".\nEvidence indicates a complex association between gut microbiota, ACE-2 expression and Vitamin D in COVID-19 severity. Status of gut microbiome is highly predictive of the blood molecular signatures and inflammatory markers and host responses to infection. Vitamin D has immunomodulatory function in innate and adaptive immune responses to viral infection. Anti-inflammatory functions of Vit D include regulation of gut microbiome and maintaining microbial diversity. It promotes growth of gut-friendly commensal strains of Bifida and Fermicutus species. In addition, Vitamin D is a negative regulator for expression of renin and interacts with the RAS/ ACE/ACE-2 signaling axis. Collectively, this triad may be the critical, link in determination of outcomes in SARS-CoV-2 infection. The presented data are empirical and informative. Further research using advanced systems biology techniques and artificial intelligence-assisted integration could assist with correlation of the gut microbiome with sepsis and vaccine responses. Modulating these factors may impact in guiding the success of vaccines and clinical outcomes in COVID-19 infections.", "This study investigated the systematic rise in cognitive ability scores over generations, known as the Flynn Effect, across middle childhood and early adolescence (7-15\u00a0years; 291\u00a0monozygotic pairs, 298 dizygotic pairs; 89% White). Leveraging the unique structure of the Louisville Twin Study (longitudinal data collected continuously from 1957 to 1999 using the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children [WISC], WISC-R, and WISC-III ed.), multilevel analyses revealed between-subjects Flynn Effects-as both decrease in mean scores upon test re-standardization and increase in mean scores across cohorts-as well as within-child Flynn Effects on cognitive growth across age. Overall gains equaled approximately three IQ points per decade. Novel genetically informed analyses suggested that individual sensitivity to the Flynn Effect was moderated by an interplay of genetic and environmental factors.", "Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common sleep disorder with multiple comorbidities including hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disorders. Detected based on an overnight sleep study is called polysomnography (PSG); OSA still remains undiagnosed in majority of the population mainly attributed to lack of awareness. To overcome the limitations posed by PSG such as patient discomfort and overnight hospitalization, newer technologies are being explored. In addition, challenges associated with current management of OSA using continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), etc. presents several pitfalls.\nConventional and modern detection/management techniques including PSG, CPAP, smart wearable/pillows, bio-motion sensors, etc., have both pros and cons. To fulfill the limitations in OSA diagnostics, there is an imperative need for new technology for screening of symptomatic and more importantly asymptomatic OSA patients to reduce the risk of several associated life-threatening comorbidities. In this line, molecular marker-based diagnostics have shown great promises.\nA detailed overview is presented on the OSA management and diagnostic approaches and recent advances in the molecular screening methods. The potentials of biomarker-based detection and its limitations are also portrayed and a comparison between the standard, current modern approaches, and promising futuristic technologies for OSA diagnostics and management is set forth.ABBREVIATIONS AHI: Apnea hypopnea index; AI: artificial intelligence; CAM: Cell adhesion molecules; CPAP: Continuous Positive Airway Pressure; COVID-19: Coronavirus Disease 2019; CVD: Cardiovascular disease; ELISA: Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; HSAT: Home sleep apnea testing; IR-UWB: Impulse radio-ultra wideband; MMA: maxillomandibular advancement; PSG: Polysomnography; OSA: Obstructive sleep apnea; SOD: Superoxide dismutase; QD: Quantum dot.", "Circle of Willis (CoW) is the most critical collateral pathway that supports the redistribution of blood supply in the brain. The variation of CoW is closely correlated with cerebral hemodynamic and cerebral vessel-related diseases. But what is responsible for CoW variation remains unclear. Moreover, the visual evaluation for CoW variation is highly time-consuming. In the present study, based on the computer tomography angiography (CTA) dataset from 255 patients, the correlation between the CoW variations with age, gender, and cerebral or cervical artery stenosis was investigated. A multitask convolutional neural network (CNN) was used to segment cerebral arteries automatically. The results showed the prevalence of variation of the anterior communicating artery (Aco) was higher in the normal senior group than in the normal young group and in females than in males. The changes in the prevalence of variations of individual segments were not demonstrated in the population with stenosis of the afferent and efferent arteries, so the critical factors for variation are related to genetic or physiological factors rather than pathological lesions. Using the multitask CNN model, complete cerebral and cervical arteries could be segmented and reconstructed in 120 seconds, and an average Dice coefficient of 78.2% was achieved. The segmentation accuracy for precommunicating part of anterior cerebral artery and posterior cerebral artery, the posterior communicating arteries, and Aco in CoW was 100%, 99.2%, 94%, and 69%, respectively. Artificial intelligence (AI) can be considered as an adjunct tool for detecting the CoW, particularly related to reducing workload and improving the accuracy of the visual evaluation. The study will serve as a basis for the following research to determine an individual's risk of stroke with the aid of AI.", "Depressive symptoms, feelings of sadness, anger, and loss that interfere with a person's daily life, are prevalent health concerns across populations that significantly result in adverse health outcomes with direct and indirect economic burdens at a national and global level. This article aims to synthesize known mechanisms of depressive symptoms and the established and emerging methodologies used to understand depressive symptoms; implications and directions for future nursing research are discussed. A comprehensive search was performed by Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, MEDLINE, and PUBMED databases between 2000-2021 to examine contributing factors of depressive symptoms. Many environmental, psychological, and physiological factors are associated with the development or increased severity of depressive symptoms (anhedonia, fatigue, sleep and appetite disturbances to depressed mood). This paper discusses biological and psychological theories that guide our understanding of depressive symptoms, as well as known biomarkers (gut microbiome, specific genes, multi-cytokine, and hormones) and established and emerging methods. Disruptions within the nervous system, hormonal and neurotransmitters levels, brain structure, gut-brain axis, leaky-gut syndrome, immune and inflammatory process, and genetic variations are significant mediating mechanisms in depressive symptomology. Nursing research and practice are at the forefront of furthering depressive symptoms' mechanisms and methods. Utilizing advanced technology and measurement tools (big data, machine learning/artificial intelligence, and multi-omic approaches) can provide insight into the psychological and biological mechanisms leading to effective intervention development. Thus, understanding depressive symptomology provides a pathway to improve patients' health outcomes, leading to reduced morbidity and mortality and the overall nation-wide economic burden.Supplemental data for this article is available online at https://doi.org/10.1080/01612840.2021.1998261 .", "Background: The aim was to study the relationship between quantitative information provided by optical coherence tomography (OCT) angiography (OCTA) and conventional angiography in macular neovascularization (MNV) secondary to age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Methods: The research was designed as an interventional, prospective study. We included 66 eyes (66 patients) affected by na\u00efve MNV. Multimodal imaging included structural OCT, OCTA, fluorescein angiography (FA), and indocyanine green angiography (ICGA). The follow-up lasted 1 year. Patients were treated by PRN anti-VEGF injections. Based on FA/ICGA examinations, we divided the patients into two categories: low vessel tortuosity (VT) (<8.40) and high VT (>8.40), correlating VT with the MNV area, leakage area, speckled fluorescence (SF) quadrants and MNV area/leakage area ratio. Results: Mean baseline BCVA was 0.50 \u00b1 0.61 LogMAR, improved to 0.31 \u00b1 0.29 LogMAR after 1 year (p < 0.01), with a mean number of 7 \u00b1 2 anti-VEGF injections. The patients revealed type-1 MNV in 36 eyes (55%), mixed type 1 and 2 MNV in 18 eyes (27%), and type-2 MNV in 12 eyes (18%). MNV eyes in high-VT MNV featured poorer BCVA, CMT, and OCTA parameters, higher SF quadrants, and less exudation, compared with low-VT MNV (p < 0.01). Moreover, 30% of high-VT MNV eyes developed outer retinal atrophy. Conclusions: Low VT MNV turned out to be more exudative at the baseline but less damaging to the outer retinal structures, whereas high VT MNV proved to be less exudative but more prone to lead to atrophic changes and visual function deterioration. VT may be usefully applied to artificial intelligence-based models designed to characterize MNV secondary to AMD.", "Society suffers from biases and discrimination, a longstanding dilemma that stems from ungrounded, subjective judgments. Especially unequal opportunities in labor remain a persistent challenge, despite the recent inauguration of top-down diplomatic measures. Here we propose a solution by using an objective approach to the measurement of nonverbal behaviors of job candidates that trained for a job assessment. First, we implemented and developed artificial intelligence, computer vision, and unbiased machine learning software to automatically detect facial muscle activity and emotional expressions to predict the candidates' self-reported motivation levels. The motivation judgments by our model outperformed recruiters' unreliable, invalid, and sometimes biased judgments. These findings mark the necessity and usefulness of novel, bias-free, and scientific approaches to candidate and employee screening and selection procedures in recruitment and human resources.", "Automated characterization of spatial data is a kind of critical geographical intelligence. As an emerging technique for characterization, spatial Representation Learning (SRL) uses deep neural networks (DNNs) to learn non-linear embedded features of spatial data for characterization. However, SRL extracts features by internal layers of DNNs, and thus suffers from lacking semantic labels. Texts of spatial entities, on the other hand, provide semantic understanding of latent feature labels, but is insensible to deep SRL models. How can we teach a SRL model to discover appropriate topic labels in texts and pair learned features with the labels? This paper formulates a new problem: feature-topic pairing, and proposes a novel Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) based deep learning framework. Specifically, we formulate the feature-topic pairing problem into an automated alignment task between 1) a latent embedding feature space and 2) a textual semantic topic space. We decompose the alignment of the two spaces into: 1) point-wise alignment, denoting the correlation between a topic distribution and an embedding vector; 2) pair-wise alignment, denoting the consistency between a feature-feature similarity matrix and a topic-topic similarity matrix. We design a PSO based solver to simultaneously select an optimal set of topics and learn corresponding features based on the selected topics. We develop a closed loop algorithm to iterate between 1) minimizing losses of representation reconstruction and feature-topic alignment and 2) searching the best topics. Finally, we present extensive experiments to demonstrate the enhanced performance of our method.", "To evaluate the role of chest computed tomography in patients with COVID-19 who presented initial negative result in reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).\nA single-center, retrospective study that evaluated 39 patients with negative RT-PCR for COVID-19, who underwent chest computed tomography and had a final clinical or serological diagnosis of COVID-19. The visual tomographic classification was evaluated according to the Consensus of the Radiological Society of North America and software developed with artificial intelligence for automatic detection of findings and chance estimation of COVID-19.\nIn the visual tomographic analysis, only one of them (3%) presented computed tomography classified as negative, 69% were classified as typical and 28% as indeterminate.

In this regard, the study addresses the development of an integrated approach encompassing DNA barcode and HPTLC fingerprinting to authenticate chiefly traded ayurvedic raw drugs in south India [viz. Saraca asoca (Roxb.) Willd., Terminalia arjuna (Roxb. ex DC.) Wight and Arn., Sida alnifolia L. and Desmodium gangeticum (L.) DC.] from its adulterants. Consortium of Barcode of Life (CBOL) recommended DNA barcode gene regions viz. nuclear ribosomal-Internal Transcribed Spacer (nrDNA-ITS), maturase K (matK), ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase large subunit (rbcL) and psbA-trnH spacer regions along with HPTLC profiling were experimented and a reference database was created. Further, an integrated analytical approach employing genetic distance-based Maximum Likelihood phylogenetic tree and Artificial Intelligence (AI)based Machine Learning Algorithms (MLA)-Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis (WEKA) and Barcoding with Logic (BLOG) were employed to prove efficacy of DNA barcode tool. Even though, among the four barcodes, psbA-trnH (S. alnifolia and its adulterants, T. arjuna and its adulterants) or ITS region (S. asoca and its adulterants, D. gangeticum and its adulterants) showed highest inter specific divergences in the selected Biological Reference Materials (BRMs), rbcL or matK barcode regions alone were successful for authentication of traded samples. The automated species identification techniques, WEKA and BLOG, experimented for the first time in India for raw drug validation, could achieve rapid and precise identification. A national certification agency for raw drug authentication employing an integrated approach involving a DNA barcoding tool along with standard organoleptic and analytical methods can strengthen and ensure safety and quality of herbal medicines in India.\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s13205-021-03001-5.", "The main purpose of this study is to compare the silent and loud reading ability of typical and dyslexic readers, using eye-tracking technology to monitor the reading process. The participants (156 students of normal intelligence) were first divided into three groups based on their school grade, and each subgroup was then further separated into typical readers and students diagnosed with dyslexia. The students read the same text twice, one time silently and one time out loud. Various eye-tracking parameters were calculated for both types of reading. In general, the performance of the typical students was better for both modes of reading - regardless of age. In the older age groups, typical readers performed better at silent reading. The dyslexic readers in all age groups performed better at reading out loud. However, this was less prominent in secondary and upper secondary dyslexics, reflecting a slow shift towards silent reading mode as they age. Our results confirm that the eye-tracking parameters of dyslexics improve with age in both silent and loud reading, and their reading preference shifts slowly towards silent reading. Typical readers, before 4th grade do not show a clear reading mode preference, however, after that age they develop a clear preference for silent reading.", "In this study, which aims at early diagnosis of Covid-19 disease using X-ray images, the deep-learning approach, a state-of-the-art artificial intelligence method, was used, and automatic classification of images was performed using convolutional neural networks (CNN). In the first training-test data set used in the study, there were 230 X-ray images, of which 150 were Covid-19 and 80 were non-Covid-19, while in the second training-test data set there were 476 X-ray images, of which 150 were Covid-19 and 326 were non-Covid-19. Thus, classification results have been provided for two data sets, containing predominantly Covid-19 images and predominantly non-Covid-19 images, respectively. In the study, a 23-layer CNN architecture and a 54-layer CNN architecture were developed. Within the scope of the study, the results were obtained using chest X-ray images directly in the training-test procedures and the sub-band images obtained by applying dual tree complex wavelet transform (DT-CWT) to the above-mentioned images. The same experiments were repeated using images obtained by applying local binary pattern (LBP) to the chest X-ray images. Within the scope of the study, four new result generation pipeline algorithms having been put forward additionally, it was ensured that the experimental results were combined and the success of the study was improved. In the experiments carried out in this study, the training sessions were carried out using the k-fold cross validation method. Here the k value was chosen as 23 for the first and second training-test data sets. Considering the average highest results of the experiments performed within the scope of the study, the values of sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, F-1 score, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for the first training-test data set were 0,9947, 0,9800, 0,9843, 0,9881 and 0,9990 respectively; while for the second training-test data set, they were 0,9920, 0,9939, 0,9891, 0,9828 and 0,9991; respectively. Within the scope of the study, finally, all the images were combined and the training and testing processes were repeated for a total of 556 X-ray images comprising 150 Covid-19 images and 406 non-Covid-19 images, by applying 2-fold cross. In this context, the average highest values of sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, F-1 score, and AUC for this last training-test data set were found to be 0,9760, 1,0000, 0,9906, 0,9823 and 0,9997; respectively.", "The shifting health care landscape in the United States has surfaced challenges related to increased accountability, interprofessional health care teams, and changes in federal policy-all of which compel physicians to adopt roles beyond clinician such as clinical investigator, team leader, and manager. To address these challenges, leadership development programs across the continuum of medical education aim to develop critical leadership skills and competencies, such as emotional intelligence. Such skills and competencies are largely taught through didactic approaches (e.g., classroom). These approaches often neglect the context of learning. From medical residency to a hospital or clinic, the contextual lived experience is habitually overlooked as a vehicle for developing emotional intelligence. This article highlights lived experience, such as medical residency, as an approach to develop emotional intelligence. First, we address the need for developing emotional intelligence as a leadership skill as well as the suitability of medical residency for such development. Next, we discuss the background of lived experience and emotional intelligence. Lastly, we identify future directions for leveraging lived experiences of medical residency to develop emotional intelligence.", "Birth order is a crucial environmental factor for child development. For example, later-born children are relatively unlikely to feel secure due to sibling competition or diluted parental resources. The positive effect of being earlier-born on cognitive intelligence is well-established. However, whether birth order is linked to social behavior remains controversial, and the neural correlates of birth order effects in adolescence when social cognition develops remain unknown. Here, we explored the birth order effect on prosociality using a large-scale population-based adolescent cohort. Next, since the amygdala is a key region for sociality and environmental stress, we examined amygdala substrates of the association between birth order and prosociality using a subset neuroimaging cohort. We found enhanced prosociality in later-born adolescents (N\u2009=\u20093160), and observed the mediating role of larger amygdala volume (N\u2009=\u2009208) and amygdala-prefrontal functional connectivity with sex-selective effects (N\u2009=\u2009183). We found that birth order, a non-genetic environmental factor, affects adolescent social development via different neural substrates. Our findings may indicate the later-born people's adaptive survival strategy in stressful environments.", "Experimental data have shown that the developing brain is especially vulnerable to exogenous noxious substances. The potential effects of anesthetic drugs on brain growth and development are a matter of concern. Clinical studies of children who underwent general anesthesia in their earliest years can make a major contribution to our understanding of the effects of anesthetic drugs on infants and toddlers (i.e., children under age 5).\nChildren born at term during the years 2007-2011 who were exposed to general anesthesia before their third birthday were included in the study. Data on general anesthesia were retrospectively evaluated, and the overall intelligence quotient (IQ) was determined prospectively as the primary target parameter. Children who had not been exposed to general anesthesia were recruited as a control group. The non-inferiority threshold was set at a difference of 5 IQ points out of a consideration of clinical relevance.\n430 complete data sets were available from exposed children and 67 from members of the control group. The exposed group achieved a mean IQ score of 108.2, with a 95% confidence interval of [107; 109.4]; the corresponding values in the control group were 113 [110; 116.1]. Both groups achieved a mean score that was higher than the expected 100 points. After adjustment for age, socioeconomic status, and sex, the difference between the two groups was 2.9 points [0.2; 5.6], indicating a significantly better outcome in the control group than in the exposed group. The non-inferiority threshold of 5 IQ points was within the confidence interval; thus, non-inferiority was not demonstrated.\nThe fact that both groups achieved a higher IQ score than the expected 100 points may be attributable, at least in part, to the restriction of the study to children born at term. The results indicate that general anesthesia in early childhood is not associated with markedly reduced intelligence in later years, although noninferiority could not be demonstrated.", "This study evaluated changes over time in the quality of children's home environment, using the Home Observation Measurement of the Environment (HOME). Longitudinal increases in HOME scores were predicted by both theory and past empirical results. Analysis of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth Children data (N\u2009=\u20095715, aged 0-14) suggested that HOME scores have been increasing, and that the increase is a family-level phenomenon. The data were a sample of children born to mothers who were approximately representative of the United States in 1979. An increase in HOME scores occurred primarily for the three age categories younger than ten. Effect sizes were of approximately the same magnitude as the Flynn effect for intelligence. These results have implications for policy and future research regarding the home environment.", "Individuals with Williams syndrome (WS) have an elevated risk for anxiety disorders throughout the life span, making it a research priority to identify the individual factors associated with anxiety. Most of the existing literature is based on questionnaire data and suggests that impaired executive functions (EF) increase the risk for anxiety in WS. The aim of this study was to use direct measures by trained clinicians to investigate the effects of general intelligence, inhibition, sustained attention, and working memory on anxiety in WS, to further elucidate potential underlying mechanisms.\nTwenty-four individuals with WS participated in the study (mean age: 29\u00a0years, range: 9-53\u00a0years), together with at least one of their parents. The MINI international neuropsychiatric interview for DSM-5 was completed to establish clinical diagnosis of anxiety, and the Clinical Global Impression Scale - Severity was used for an expert rating of symptom severity. Intellectual abilities were measured using the Wechsler scales, and attention and inhibition using the Conner's Continuous Performance Test. In addition, a parent-report questionnaire measuring EF, learning and memory was collected.\nIn contrast to the apriori hypothesis, there was no significant association between anxiety and core elements of EF such as working memory, sustained attention, and inhibition (i.e. the process of restraining one's impulses or behaviour). Using ordinal logistic regression analyses, we showed that decreasing intelligence quotient (IQ) and age are associated with elevated anxiety. We confirmed these results in between-groups analyses (anxiety disorder vs no current anxiety disorder), and low IQ was associated with higher risk of having an anxiety diagnosis. In addition, Bayesian statistics gave substantial evidence for no significant association between anxiety and inhibition.\nBy using direct measures of psychological pathology and functioning, the current results provide a deeper characterisation of the WS phenotype and provide novel insights into the potential mechanisms underpinning anxiety.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) has illuminated a clear path towards an evolving health-care system replete with enhanced precision and computing capabilities. Medical imaging analysis can be strengthened by machine learning as the multidimensional data generated by imaging naturally lends itself to hierarchical classification. In this Review, we describe the role of machine intelligence in image-based endocrine cancer diagnostics. We first provide a brief overview of AI and consider its intuitive incorporation into the clinical workflow. We then discuss how AI can be applied for the characterization of adrenal, pancreatic, pituitary and thyroid masses in order to support clinicians in their diagnostic interpretations. This Review also puts forth a number of key evaluation criteria for machine learning in medicine that physicians can use in their appraisals of these algorithms. We identify mitigation strategies to address ongoing challenges around data availability and model interpretability in the context of endocrine cancer diagnosis. Finally, we delve into frontiers in systems integration for AI, discussing automated pipelines and evolving computing platforms that leverage distributed, decentralized and quantum techniques.", "The severe spread of the COVID-19 pandemic has created a situation of public health emergency and global awareness. In our research, we analyzed the demographical factors affecting the global pandemic spread along with the features that lead to death due to the infection. Modeling results stipulate that the mortality rate increase as the age increase and it is found that most of the death cases belong to the age group 60-80. Cluster-based analysis of age groups is also conducted to analyze the maximum targeted age-groups. An association between positive COVID-19 cases and deceased cases are also presented, with the impact on male and female death cases due to corona. Additionally, we have also presented an artificial intelligence-based statistical approach to predict the survival chances of corona infected people in South Korea with the analysis of the impact on the exploratory factors, including age-groups, gender, temporal evolution, etc. To analyze the coronavirus cases, we applied machine learning with hyperparameters tuning and deep learning models with an autoencoder-based approach for estimating the influence of the disparate features on the spread of the disease and predict the survival possibilities of the quarantined patients in isolation. The model calibrated in the study is based on positive corona infection cases and presents the analysis over different aspects that proven to be impactful to analyze the temporal trends in the current situation along with the exploration of deceased cases due to coronavirus. Analysis delineates key points in the outbreak spreading, indicating that the models driven by machine intelligence and deep learning can be effective in providing a quantitative view of the epidemical outbreak.", "The vast majority of thyroid cancers originate from follicular cells. We outline outstanding issues at each step along the path of cancer patient care, from prevention to post-treatment follow-up and highlight how emerging technologies will help address them in the coming years. Three directions will dominate the coming technological landscape. Genomics will reveal tumoral evolutionary history and shed light on how these cancers arise from the normal epithelium and the genomics alteration driving their progression. Transcriptomics will gain cellular and spatial resolution providing a full account of intra-tumor heterogeneity and opening a window on the microenvironment supporting thyroid tumor growth. Artificial intelligence will set morphological analysis on an objective quantitative ground laying the foundations of a systematic thyroid tumor classification system. It will also integrate into unified representations the molecular and morphological perspectives on thyroid cancer.", "Almost two decades of research produced mixed findings on the relationship between celebrity worship and cognitive skills. Several studies demonstrated that cognitive performance slightly decreases with higher levels of celebrity worship, while other studies found no association between these constructs. This study has two aims: (1) to extend previous research on the association between celebrity worship and cognitive skills by applying the two-factor theory of intelligence by Cattell on a relatively large sample of Hungarian adults, and (2) to investigate the explanatory power of celebrity worship and other relevant variables in cognitive performance.\nA cross-sectional study design was used. Applying an online survey, a total of 1763 Hungarian adults (66.42% male, Mage\u2009=\u200937.22\u00a0years, SD\u2009=\u200911.38) completed two intelligence subtests designed to measure ability in vocabulary (Vocabulary Test) and digit symbol (Short Digit Symbol Test). Participants also completed the Celebrity Attitude Scale and the Rosenberg Self-esteem Scale. Subjective material wealth, current family income and general sociodemographics were also reported by participants.\nLinear regression models indicated that celebrity worship was associated with lower performance on the cognitive tests even after controlling for demographic variables, material wealth and self-esteem, although the explanatory power was limited.\nThese findings suggest that there is a direct association between celebrity worship and poorer performance on the cognitive tests that cannot be accounted for by\u00a0demographic and socioeconomic factors.", "Little is known about which indicators of performance elite athlete coaches (i.e., professional coaches who coach at the national or international levels) consider to be important for basketball.\nUsing a Delphi procedure, the aim of this study was to identify the non-game performance indicators elite athlete coaches consider to be important for the recruitment/selection of basketball players.\nNinety elite athlete coaches (basketball coaches (n\u2009=\u200971) and strength/conditioning coaches (n\u2009=\u200919) who coached men (n\u2009=\u200960), women (n\u2009=\u200923), or both (n\u2009=\u20097)), employed in 23 countries across six continents, participated in a three-round online Delphi survey. Round 1 asked coaches to identify the non-game performance indicators (i.e., measures other than game statistics) they currently used (or would like to use) for player recruitment/selection, with common indicators combined into single indicators. Round 2 asked coaches to rate the importance of each performance indicator using a Likert scale (range: 0\u2009=\u2009no importance whatsoever to 10\u2009=\u2009extremely important). Round 3 asked coaches to identify the single best test measure for each indicator rated\u2009\u2265\u20096 (i.e., important to extremely important) in Round 2. Results were reported descriptively.\nA total of 608 responses (344 after removal of duplicates) were reported in Round 1, which were collapsed into 35 indicators, all of which were rated as 'important' in Round 2. Psychological and game intelligence indicators were typically rated as very important to extremely important (i.e., median\u2009=\u20099), with physical fitness and movement skills typically rated as very important (i.e., median\u2009=\u20098). For most indicators, coach observation was identified as the best test measure, with unique objective performance/anthropometric tests identified for all physical fitness indicators.\nThis study identified a range of psychological, game intelligence, physical fitness, and movement skill indicators that were considered by elite athlete coaches to be important to extremely important for the recruitment/selection of basketball players. These findings may inform the development of a basketball-specific test battery for recruiting/selecting and monitoring players.", "To examine the role of explainability in machine learning for healthcare (MLHC), and its necessity and significance with respect to effective and ethical MLHC application.\nThis commentary engages with the growing and dynamic corpus of literature on the use of MLHC and artificial intelligence (AI) in medicine, which provide the context for a focused narrative review of arguments presented in favour of and opposition to explainability in MLHC.\nWe find that concerns regarding explainability are not limited to MLHC, but rather extend to numerous well-validated treatment interventions as well as to human clinical judgment itself. We examine the role of evidence-based medicine in evaluating inexplicable treatments and technologies, and highlight the analogy between the concept of explainability in MLHC and the related concept of mechanistic reasoning in evidence-based medicine.\nUltimately, we conclude that the value of explainability in MLHC is not intrinsic, but is instead instrumental to achieving greater imperatives such as performance and trust. We caution against the uncompromising pursuit of explainability, and advocate instead for the development of robust empirical methods to successfully evaluate increasingly inexplicable algorithmic systems.", "This review aims to demonstrate how natural language processing is used in orthopaedic research.\nNatural language processing is a form of artificial intelligence that involves encoding human-generated text or speech into a form which can be interpreted by computers to perform a variety of tasks. Natural language processing gathers, processes, and organizes large amounts of free-text data more efficiently than humans. In orthopaedics, it has been utilized for retrospective chart review, automated reporting of electronic health record data, analyzing operative notes and radiology reports, and patient reviews of physicians and practices. Although still in its infancy, natural language processing promises to be a valuable tool in the future of orthopaedic research. It will not eliminate the need for the essential human component of questioning involved in research, but natural language processing can improve the quality, efficiency, and thoroughness of research, thus improving patient care.", "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence in machines so they can perform various actions and execute decision-making. Machine learning (ML), a branch of AI, can analyse information from data and discover novel patterns. AI and ML are rapidly gaining prominence in healthcare as data become increasingly complex. These algorithms can enhance the role of cardiovascular imaging by automating many tasks or calculations, find new patterns or phenotypes in data and provide alternative diagnoses. In interventional cardiology, AI can assist in intraprocedural guidance, intravascular imaging and provide additional information to the operator. AI is slowly expanding its boundaries into interventional cardiology and can fundamentally alter the field. In this review, the authors discuss how AI can enhance the role of cardiovascular imaging and imaging in interventional cardiology.", "Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) is a vital diagnostic tool in the management of cardiovascular diseases. The advent of advanced CMR technologies combined with artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to simplify imaging, reduce image acquisition time without compromising image quality (IQ), and improve magnetic field uniformity. Here, we aim to implement two AI-based deep learning techniques for automatic slice alignment and cardiac shimming and evaluate their performance in clinical cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).\nTwo deep neural networks were developed, trained, and validated on pre-acquired cardiac MRI datasets (>500 subjects) to achieve automatic slice planning and shimming (implemented in the scanner) for CMR. To examine the performance of our automated cardiac planning (EasyScan) and AI-based shim (AI shim), two prospective studies were performed subsequently. For the EasyScan validation, 10 healthy subjects underwent two identical CMR protocols: with manual cardiac planning and with AI-based EasyScan to assess protocol scan time difference and accuracy of cardiac plane prescriptions on a 1.5 T clinical MRI scanner. For the AI shim validation, a total of 20 subjects were recruited: 10 healthy and 10 cardio-oncology patients with referrals for a CMR examination. Cine images were obtained with standard cardiac volume shim and with AI shim to assess signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), overall IQ (sharpness and MR image degradation), ejection fraction (EF), and absolute wall thickening. A hybrid statistical method using of nonparametric (Wilcoxon) and parametric (t-test) assessments was employed for statistical analyses.\nCMR protocol with AI-based plane prescriptions, EasyScan, minimized operator dependence and reduced overall scanning time by over 2 min (\u223c13\u00a0% faster, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) compared to the protocol with manual cardiac planning. EasyScan plane prescriptions also demonstrated more accurate (less plane angulation errors from planes manually prescribed by a certified cardiac MRI technologist) cardiac planes than previously reported strategies. Additionally, AI shim resulted in improved B0 field homogeneity. Cine images obtained with AI shim revealed a significantly higher SNR (12.49%; p\u00a0=\u00a00.002) than those obtained with volume shim (volume shim: 32.90\u00a0\u00b1 7.42\u00a0vs. AI shim: 37.01\u00a0\u00b1 8.87) for the left ventricle (LV) myocardium. LV myocardium CNR was 12.48% higher for cine imaging with AI shim (149.02\u00a0\u00b1 39.15) than volume shim (132.49\u00a0\u00b1 33.94). Images obtained with AI shim resulted in sharper images than those obtained with volume shim (p\u00a0=\u00a00.012). The LVEF and absolute wall thickening also showed that differences exist between the two shimming methods. The LVEF by AI shim was shown to be slightly larger than LVEF by volume shim in two groups: 2.87% higher with AI shim for the healthy group and 1.70% higher with AI shim for the patient group. The LV absolute wall thickening (in mm) also showed that differences exist between shimming methods for each group with larger changes observed in the patient group (healthy: 3.31%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.234 and patient group: 7.29%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.059).\nCMR exams using EasyScan for cardiac planning demonstrated accelerated cardiac exam compared to the CMR protocol with manual cardiac planning. Improved and more uniform B0 magnetic field homogeneity also achieved using AI shim technique compared to volume shimming.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) has been transforming the practice of drug discovery in the past decade. Various AI techniques have been used in many drug discovery applications, such as virtual screening and drug design. In this survey, we first give an overview on drug discovery and discuss related applications, which can be reduced to two major tasks, i.e. molecular property prediction and molecule generation. We then present common data resources, molecule representations and benchmark platforms. As a major part of the survey, AI techniques are dissected into model architectures and learning paradigms. To reflect the technical development of AI in drug discovery over the years, the surveyed works are organized chronologically. We expect that this survey provides a comprehensive review on AI in drug discovery. We also provide a GitHub repository with a collection of papers (and codes, if applicable) as a learning resource, which is regularly updated.", "The proposed European Artificial Intelligence Act (AIA) is the first attempt to elaborate a general legal framework for AI carried out by any major global economy. As such, the AIA is likely to become a point of reference in the larger discourse on how AI systems can (and should) be regulated. In this article, we describe and discuss the two primary enforcement mechanisms proposed in the AIA: the conformity assessments that providers of high-risk AI systems are expected to conduct, and the post-market monitoring plans that providers must establish to document the performance of high-risk AI systems throughout their lifetimes. We argue that the\u00a0AIA can be interpreted as a proposal to establish a Europe-wide ecosystem for conducting AI auditing, albeit in other words. Our analysis offers two main contributions. First, by describing the enforcement mechanisms included in the AIA in terminology borrowed from existing literature on AI auditing, we help providers of AI systems understand how they can prove adherence to the requirements set out in the AIA in practice. Second, by examining the AIA from an auditing perspective, we seek to provide transferable lessons from previous research about how to refine further the regulatory approach outlined in the AIA. We conclude by highlighting seven aspects of the AIA where amendments (or simply clarifications) would be helpful. These include, above all, the need to translate vague concepts into verifiable criteria and to strengthen the institutional safeguards concerning conformity assessments based on internal checks.", "Deep neural networks have achieved great success in almost every field of artificial intelligence. However, several weaknesses keep bothering researchers due to its hierarchical structure, particularly when large-scale parallelism, faster learning, better performance, and high reliability are required. Inspired by the parallel and large-scale information processing structures in the human brain, a shallow broad neural network model is proposed on a specially designed multi-order Descartes expansion operation. Such Descartes expansion acts as an efficient feature extraction method for the network, improve the separability of the original pattern by transforming the raw data pattern into a high-dimensional feature space, the multi-order Descartes expansion space. As a result, a single-layer perceptron network will be able to accomplish the classification task. The multi-order Descartes expansion neural network (MODENN) is thus created by combining the multi-order Descartes expansion operation and the single-layer perceptron together, and its capacity is proved equivalent to the traditional multi-layer perceptron and the deep neural networks. Three kinds of experiments were implemented, the results showed that the proposed MODENN model retains great potentiality in many aspects, including implementability, parallelizability, performance, robustness, and interpretability, indicating MODENN would be an excellent alternative to mainstream neural networks.", "The face of a person is an important source of communication and information especially for politicians who are continuously portrayed through media. Voters may use this information to form an impression about the candidates and several inferences may be drawn. Within this frame, research has largely investigated gender differences. One line of research has focused on the facial prominence of people portrayed in pictures, describing a tendency to portray men with a higher face prominence as compared to women. This bias has been defined as the face-ism effect and it has a key influence on the perception of dominance, competence, intelligence, and ambition of the portrayed individuals. Several studies in recent years analyzed the differences between the self-representation of men and women in social media, but no study specifically focused on politicians directly comparing two different types of profiles: private vs. public. In two studies, we analyzed differences in face-ism index comparing male and female politicians both for pictures posted in private and public Facebook accounts. In Study 1 results showed that no difference emerged between men and women engaged in politics when considering public pages; however, when private profiles are analyzed, women displayed a higher face-ism index than their male counterparts. Study 2 partially confirmed results from Study 1 considering Italian politicians. Overall, current results showed a different pattern as compared to previous studies suggesting an increase in perceived agency and dominance for female candidates, particularly emphasized in their private profiles.", "Despite the invention of various non-invasive bioengineering tools, skin-type analysis has largely been based on subjective assessments. However, advancements in the functional cosmetic industry and artificial intelligence-assisted dermatology are creating a greater demand for an objective skin-type classification system.\nTo propose an objective skin-type classification system solely based on non-invasive, bioengineering devices; provide reference values applicable to the Korean population; and compare our reference values with those of published studies.\nBiophysical parameter measurements were obtained from the 2018 International Skin Characteristics Data Bank Project conducted by the Foundation of Korea Cosmetic Industry Institute. The participants were 434 healthy South Korean adults. Each participant was assessed using eight bioengineering devices (Tewameter\u00ae , pH-meter\u00ae , Corneometer\u00ae , Sebumeter\u00ae , Cutometer\u00ae , Spectrophotometer\u00ae , PRIMOS\u00ae lite, and Janus\u00ae ). The measurements were divided into tertiles to determine reference points.\nOur objective skin-type classification consists of five main categories (sensitivity, hydration, oiliness, elasticity, and skin tone) and five corresponding subcategories (erythema, roughness, pores, wrinkles, and pigmentation, respectively). Each skin type was assigned based on the reference point of the biophysical parameter, which was established as the tertile value associated with 'unfavourable' skin characteristics. Individuals were categorized as having sensitive skin when the TEWL scores were over 18.0\u2009g/m2 /h or the pH was over 5.45; dehydrated skin when the corneometric value measured below 47.17 A.U.; oily skin when the sebumetric value exceeded 70\u2009\u03bcg/cm2 ; and loose skin when the cutometric R2 value was below 0.68 E/mm.\nThis study is the first to provide a comprehensive skin-type classification system based solely on non-invasive biophysical parameters. As measurement data accumulate, the reference points will progress to become more accurate, and they will be subdivided according to gender, age, and ethnic group. Therefore, our classification system serves as a basis for artificial intelligence-based skin-type analysis.", "Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is one of the leading causes of vision loss globally, and early detection plays a significant role in the prognosis. Several studies have been done on the single field fundus photography and artificial intelligence (AI) in DR screening using standardized data sets in urban outpatient settings. This study was carried out to validate AI algorithm in the detection of DR severity using fundus photography in real-time rural setting.\nThis cross-sectional study was carried out among 138 patients who underwent routine ophthalmic examination, irrespective of their diabetic status. The participants were subjected to a single field color fundus photography using nonmydriatic fundus camera. The images acquired were processed by AI algorithm for image quality, presence and refer ability of DR. The results were graded by four ophthalmologists. Interobserver variability between the four observers was also calculated.\nOf the 138 patients, 26 patients (18.84%) had some stage of DR, represented by 47 images (17.03%) positive for signs of DR. All 26 patients were immoderate or severe stage. About 6.5% of the images were considered as not gradable due to poor optical quality. The average agreement between pairs of the four graders was 95.16% for referable DR (RDR). The AI showed 100% sensitivity in detecting DR while the specificity for RDR was 91.47%.\nAI has shown excellent sensitivity and specificity in RDR detection, at par with the performance of individual ophthalmologists and is an invaluable tool for DR screening.", "The prevalence of chronic disease is growing in aging societies, and artificial-intelligence-assisted interpretation of macular degeneration images is a topic that merits research. This study proposes a residual neural network (ResNet) model constructed using uniform design. The ResNet model is an artificial intelligence model that classifies macular degeneration images and can assist medical professionals in related tests and classification tasks, enhance confidence in making diagnoses, and reassure patients. However, the various hyperparameters in a ResNet lead to the problem of hyperparameter optimization in the model. This study employed uniform design-a systematic, scientific experimental design-to optimize the hyperparameters of the ResNet and establish a ResNet with optimal robustness.\nAn open dataset of macular degeneration images ( https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/rscbjbr9sj/3 ) was divided into training, validation, and test datasets. According to accuracy, false negative rate, and signal-to-noise ratio, this study used uniform design to determine the optimal combination of ResNet hyperparameters. The ResNet model was tested and the results compared with results obtained in a previous study using the same dataset. The ResNet model achieved higher optimal accuracy (0.9907), higher mean accuracy (0.9848), and a lower mean false negative rate (0.015) than did the model previously reported. The optimal ResNet hyperparameter combination identified using the uniform design method exhibited excellent performance.\nThe high stability of the ResNet model established using uniform design is attributable to the study's strict focus on achieving both high accuracy and low standard deviation. This study optimized the hyperparameters of the ResNet model by using uniform design because the design features uniform distribution of experimental points and facilitates effective determination of the representative parameter combination, reducing the time required for parameter design and fulfilling the requirements of a systematic parameter design process.", "Development of neural interface and brain-machine interface (BMI) systems enables the treatment of neurological disorders including cognitive, sensory, and motor dysfunctions. While neural interfaces have steadily decreased in form factor, recent developments target pervasive implantables. Along with advances in electrodes, neural recording, and neurostimulation circuits, integration of disease biomarkers and machine learning algorithms enables real-time and on-site processing of neural activity with no need for power-demanding telemetry. This recent trend on combining artificial intelligence and machine learning with modern neural interfaces will lead to a new generation of low-power, smart, and miniaturized therapeutic devices for a wide range of neurological and psychiatric disorders. This paper reviews the recent development of the 'on-chip' machine learning and neuromorphic architectures, which is one of the key puzzles in devising next-generation clinically viable neural interface systems.", "The development of vaccines for the treatment of COVID-19 is paving the way for new hope. Despite this, the risk of the virus mutating into a vaccine-resistant variant still persists. As a result, the demand of efficacious drugs to treat COVID-19 is still pertinent. To this end, scientists continue to identify and repurpose marketed drugs for this new disease. Many of these drugs are currently undergoing clinical trials and, so far, only one has been officially approved by FDA. Drug repurposing is a much faster route to the clinic than standard drug development of novel molecules, nevertheless in a pandemic this process is still not fast enough to halt the spread of the virus. Artificial intelligence has already played a large part in hastening the drug discovery process, not only by facilitating the selection of potential drug candidates but also in monitoring the pandemic and enabling faster diagnosis of patients. In this chapter, we focus on the impact and challenges that artificial intelligence has demonstrated thus far with respect to drug repurposing of therapeutics for the treatment of COVID-19.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) has made considerable progress in image recognition, especially in the analysis of endoscopic images. The availability of large-scale annotated datasets has contributed to the recent progress in this field. Datasets of high-quality annotated endoscopic images are widely available, particularly in Japan. A system for collecting annotated data reported daily could aid in accumulating a significant number of high-quality annotated datasets.\nWe assessed the validity of using daily annotated endoscopic images in a constructed reporting system for a prototype AI model for polyp detection.\nWe constructed an automated collection system for daily annotated datasets from an endoscopy reporting system. The key images were selected and annotated for each case only during daily practice, not to be performed retrospectively. We automatically extracted annotated endoscopic images of diminutive colon polyps that had been diagnosed (study period March-September 2018) using the keywords of diagnostic information, and additionally collect the normal colon images. The collected dataset was devised into training and validation to build and evaluate the AI system. The detection model was developed using a deep learning algorithm, RetinaNet.\nThe automated system collected endoscopic images (47,391) from colonoscopies (745), and extracted key colon polyp images (1356) with localized annotations. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of our AI model were 97.0%, 97.7%, and 97.3% (n\u2009=\u2009300), respectively.\nThe automated system enabled the development of a high-performance colon polyp detector using images in endoscopy reporting system without the efforts of retrospective annotation works.", "Objective. Alzheimer's disease (AD), a common disease of the elderly with unknown etiology, has been adversely affecting many people, especially with the aging of the population and the younger trend of this disease. Current artificial intelligence (AI) methods based on individual information or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can solve the problem of diagnostic sensitivity and specificity, but still face the challenges of interpretability and clinical feasibility. In this study, we propose an interpretable multimodal deep reinforcement learning model for inferring pathological features and the diagnosis of AD.Approach. First, for better clinical feasibility, the compressed-sensing MRI image is reconstructed using an interpretable deep reinforcement learning model. Then, the reconstructed MRI is input into the full convolution neural network to generate a pixel-level disease probability risk map (DPM) of the whole brain for AD. The DPM of important brain regions and individual information are then input into the attention-based fully deep neural network to obtain the diagnosis results and analyze the biomarkers. We used 1349 multi-center samples to construct and test the model.Main results.Finally, the model obtained 99.6% \u00b1 0.2%, 97.9% \u00b1 0.2%, and 96.1% \u00b1 0.3% area under curve in ADNI, AIBL and NACC, respectively. The model also provides an effective analysis of multimodal pathology, predicts the imaging biomarkers in MRI and the weight of each individual item of information. In this study, a deep reinforcement learning model was designed, which can not only accurately diagnose AD, but analyze potential biomarkers.Significance. In this study, a deep reinforcement learning model was designed. The model builds a bridge between clinical practice and AI diagnosis and provides a viewpoint for the interpretability of AI technology.", "Artificial Intelligence has been widely applied today, and the subsequent privacy leakage problems have also been paid attention to. Attacks such as model inference attacks on deep neural networks can easily extract user information from neural networks. Therefore, it is necessary to protect privacy in deep learning. Differential privacy, as a popular topic in privacy-preserving in recent years, which provides rigorous privacy guarantee, can also be used to preserve privacy in deep learning. Although many articles have proposed different methods to combine differential privacy and deep learning, there are no comprehensive papers to analyze and compare the differences and connections between these technologies. For this purpose, this paper is proposed to compare different differential private methods in deep learning. We comparatively analyze and classify several deep learning models under differential privacy. Meanwhile, we also pay attention to the application of differential privacy in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), comparing and analyzing these models. Finally, we summarize the application of differential privacy in deep neural networks.", "The purpose of this study was to engineer deep learning (DL) models that can identify myopic maculopathy in patients with high myopia based on optical coherence tomography (OCT) images.\nAn artificial intelligence (AI) system was developed using 2342 qualified OCT macular images from 1041 patients with pathologic myopia admitted to the Affiliated Eye Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University (WMU). We adopted an ResNeSt101 architecture to train five independent models to identify the following five myopic maculopathies: macular choroidal thinning, macular Bruch membrane (BM) defects, subretinal hyper-reflective material (SHRM), myopic traction maculopathy (MTM), and dome-shaped macula (DSM). We tested the models with an independent test dataset that included 450 images obtained from 297 patients with high myopia. Focal loss was used to address class imbalance, and optimal operating thresholds were determined according to the Youden Index. The performance was quantified using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, and confusion matrix.\nFor the identification of myopic maculopathy, the AUCs of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were 0.927 to 0.974 for 5 myopic maculopathies. Our AI system achieved sensitivities equal to or even better than those of junior retinal specialists (56.16-99.73%). The diagnosis of it is also interpretable that we provide visual explanations clearly via heatmaps.\nWe developed a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based DL AI system for detection and classification of myopic maculopathy in patients with high myopia using OCT macular images. Our AI system achieved sensitivities equal to or even better than those of junior retinal specialists.\nThis AI system can be widely applied in sophisticated situations in large-scale high myopia screening.", "Doctors have multiple roles to play in the society. The emotional intelligence (EI) of medical college teachers plays a decisive role on the outcome of medical students. Teachers with good EI will create a learning environment that encourages positive social interaction, active encouragement, and motivation to learn among students.\nThe objective of the study is to assess the level of EI and the influence of sociodemographic variables on it among teaching faculties of a medical college.\nA cross-sectional study was conducted using self-report EI questionnaire scale. The data were analyzed and expressed in percentages and proportions. Mean, standard deviation, and statistical significance were calculated, wherever necessary.\nMore than half of the teaching faculty showed average EI (66.67%) and 8.33% had poor EI. The social skills of teaching faculty showed positive correlation and statistical significance with teaching experience.\nThere is a need to take appropriate steps to improve the EI of teaching faculties by the institutions as it has an impact on the outcome of learner doctors.", "With increasing computing and storage capacity, the application of big data and artificial intelligence (AI) is almost inexorably finding its way into medicine. The main areas of application so far have been in radiology and pathology, as well as in other areas such as genome sequencing and psychiatry. By evaluating ever larger amounts of data, patterns are sought that can make physicians' work easier by making a\u00a0preselection. In addition, efforts are being made to uncover previously unrecognized connections. Large amounts of data are recorded by the patients themselves using so-called wearables. How can this data be used meaningfully? What are the dangers? Efforts are also being made in urology to improve the treatment of urinary tract infections and kidney stones, for example, through the use of networked computer systems. Great progress can be expected in the next few years in the field of big data and AI. An enormous expansion of the areas of application is going to come; as such, we are only at the beginning of the development.\nMit zunehmender Rechen- und Speicherkapazit\u00e4t h\u00e4lt in der Medizin fast unaufhaltsam die Anwendung von Big Data und k\u00fcnstlicher Intelligenz Einzug.

This cross-sectional study explores to what extent standardized symptom questionnaires and intelligence tests are applied in German Socialpediatric Centres. In Germany there exist 152 SPZ. One third participated in this questionnaire study (N = 50). Symptom questionnaires are applied by all participating SPZ (100 %), intelligence tests are used by 98 %. Among the most frequent used tests are intelligence tests (\"Wechsler Intelligence Scale For Children (WISC)\"; \"Snijders-Oomen Nonverbale Intelligenztest\" (SON-R5,5-17)) and tests assessing mental health symptoms (\"Diagnostik-System f\u00fcr psychische St\u00f6rungen (DISYPS-2)\"; \"Child Behavior Checklist-Elternfragebogen\" (CBCL 4/18)). Specific mental disorders are assessed with a variety of different questionnaires. In our questionnaire 14 standardized symptom and intelligence tests were listed. The participating SPZ listed 110 additional symptom questionnaires that are used as well. Standardized symptom diagnostic at SPZ seems to focus on autism spectrum disorders, anxiety disorders, and depression. Implications for research and clinical practice are derived.\nZusammenfassung Sozialp\u00e4diatrische Zentren (SPZ) sind ambulante Einrichtungen, in denen Kinder und Jugendliche mit psychischen, geistigen und k\u00f6rperlichen Erkrankungen und Behinderungen diagnostiziert und behandelt werden. Diese Querschnitt-Studie untersucht, in welchem Umfang standardisierte Symptomfrageb\u00f6gen und Intelligenztests an Sozialp\u00e4diatrischen Zentren (SPZ) in Deutschland eingesetzt werden. Ein Drittel aller 152 SPZ in Deutschland nahmen an der schriftlichen Befragung teil (N = 50). Alle teilnehmenden SPZ nutzen standardisierte Verfahren der Symptomdiagnostik (100 %) und 98 % setzen Intelligenztests ein. Zwei Intelligenztests werden von fast allen SPZ genutzt (\u201eWechsler Intelligence Scale For Children (WISC)\u201c; \u201eSnijders-Oomen Nonverbale Intelligenztest\u201c (SON-R5,5-17)).

Currently, primary uses involve presurgical planning and patient and medical trainee education. Neuroradiology is a complex subdiscipline of radiology that requires further training beyond radiology residency. This review seeks to explore the clinical value of 3D printing and modeling specifically in enhancing neuroradiology education for radiology physician residents and medical trainees.\nA brief review summarizing the key steps from radiologic image to 3D printed model is provided, including storage of computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging data as digital imaging and communications in medicine files; conversion to standard tessellation language (STL) format; manipulation of STL files in interactive medical image control system software (Materialise) to create 3D models; and 3D printing using various resins via a Formlabs 2 printer.\nFor the purposes of demonstration and proof of concept, neuroanatomy models deemed crucial in early radiology education were created via open-source hardware designs under free or open licenses. 3D-printed objects included a sphenoid bone, cerebellum, skull base, middle ear labyrinth and ossicles, mandible, circle of Willis, carotid aneurysm, and lumbar spine using a combination of clear, white, and elastic resins.\nBased on this single-institution experience, 3D-printed complex neuroanatomical structures seem feasible and may enhance resident education and patient safety. These same steps and principles may be applied to other subspecialties of radiology. Artificial intelligence also has the potential to advance the 3D process.", "Delinquent behaviors are risky behaviors that increase during puberty and reach their highest peak in late adolescence. It has been proposed that poor decision-making and theory of mind (ToM) are key cognitive processes implicated with delinquency during adolescence, affecting evaluation of risks and impairing appreciation of social norms. Nevertheless, it is not yet clear whether adolescent offenders who are subjected to provisional deprivation of liberty due to conflict with the law (adolescents in conflict with the law [ACL]) might, in fact, present a specific profile with regard to these cognitive processes.\nTo assess deliberative decision-making and ToM among adolescents in conflict with the law and adolescents not in conflict with the law.\nThe sample comprised 62 participants: ACL (n = 29) and a control group (CG) (n = 33). ToM was assessed with the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET) and decision-making was assessed with the Columbia Card Task (CCT). Substance use, callous-unemotional traits, childhood maltreatment, and intelligence quotient (IQ) were also assessed.\nACL had more ToM errors for negative mental states in comparison to CG, but not for error rates concerning neutral and positive mental states. With regards to decision-making, our results suggest that ACL group members did not vary their behavior based on the available information and that the risk information had an opposite effect on the number of cards chosen (risk-taking behavior) when compared to CG.\nThese findings have important implications for development of interventions for these adolescents, suggesting that they tend to learn little from negative outcomes and have reduced capacity to process negative emotions.", "Previous studies have found a correlation between numerosity processing and arithmetical performance. Visual perception has already been indicated as the shared cognitive mechanism between these two; however, these studies mostly focused on children. It is not clear whether the association between numerosity processing and arithmetical performance still existed following the development of individual arithmetical performance. Consequently, the underlying role of visual perception in numerosity processing and arithmetical performance has not been sufficiently studied in adults. For this study, researchers selected a total of 205 adult participants with an average age of 22years. The adults were administered arithmetic tests, numerosity comparison, and visual figure matching. Mental rotation, choice reaction time, and nonverbal intelligence were used as cognitive covariates. Results showed that numerosity comparison of adults correlated with their arithmetical performance, even after controlling for age and gender differences as well as general cognitive processing. However, after controlled for visual figure matching, the well-established association between numerosity comparison and arithmetic performance disappeared. These results supported the visual perception hypothesis, that visual perception measured by visual figure matching can account for the correlation between numerosity comparison and arithmetic performance. This indicated that even for adult populations, visual perceptual ability was the underlying component of numerosity processing and arithmetic performance.", "Envy is a mixed negative emotion that is characterized by feelings of hostility, inferiority, resentment, and depression. It has been found that mindfulness is negatively associated with envy. This paper aimed to explore the interaction between mindfulness and envy by referring to the mindful emotion regulation model, and it also examines the mediation of emotional intelligence. Six hundred and seventy-six participants (182 men and 494 women) completed the Mindful Attention Awareness Scale, the Dispositional Envy Scale, and the Wong Law Emotional Intelligence Scale. Results suggest that mindfulness is significantly and negatively correlated with envy. Meanwhile, a multiple mediation analysis indicated that regulation of emotion and use of emotion partially mediate the impact of mindfulness on envy. The current study not only provides a theoretical basis for possible mechanisms underlying the inhibition of envy, but also provides valuable guidance for developing mindfulness-based intervention programs aiming at reducing the negative effects of envy.", "Skin cancer remains the most commonly diagnosed cancer in the USA with more than 1 million new cases each year. Melanomas account for about 1% of all skin cancers and most skin cancer deaths. Multiethnic individuals whose skin is pigmented underestimate their risk for skin cancers and melanomas and may delay seeking a diagnosis. The use of artificial intelligence may help improve the diagnostic precision of dermatologists/physicians to identify malignant lesions. To validate our artificial intelligence's efficiency in distinguishing between images, we utilized 50 images obtained from our International Skin Imaging Collaboration dataset (n\u2009=\u200925) and pathologically confirmed lesions (n\u2009=\u200925). We compared the ability of our artificial intelligence to visually diagnose these 50 skin cancer lesions with a panel of three dermatologists. The artificial intelligence model better differentiated between melanoma vs. nonmelanoma with an area under the curve of 0.948. The three-panel member dermatologists correctly diagnosed a similar number of images (n\u2009=\u200935) as the artificial intelligence program (n\u2009=\u200934). Fleiss' kappa (\u0138) score for the raters and artificial intelligence indicated fair (0.247) agreement. However, the combined result of the dermatologists panel with the artificial intelligence assessments correctly identified 100% of the images from the test data set. Our artificial intelligence platform was able to utilize visual images to discriminate melanoma from nonmelanoma, using de-identified images. The combined results of the artificial intelligence with those of the dermatologists support the use of artificial intelligence as an efficient lesion assessment strategy to reduce time and expense in diagnoses to reduce delays in treatment.", "Loneliness and social isolation are significant public health crises in older adults. The issues about companionship have many psychosocial and cultural dimensions, which is further compounded by the current COVID-19 pandemic. In modern-day India, there is a significant increase in the number of older adults left to live alone because of sociocultural changes in our society. Companionship in late life is known to promote the quality of life and decrease the mental health morbidity. There is an increasing role of pets as companions to the elderly. Novel technologies such as artificial intelligence in the form of robots are being explored to support the elderly. Sexuality is another complex issue related to older adults that is often ignored. The sexuality and sexual functioning in older adults largely depend on physiological, psychological, and sociocultural factors. The principles of ageism have influenced sexuality in older adults. Sociocultural issues and the aging-related pathophysiological changes can contribute to an increased risk for legal issues related to sexuality in this population. There is a need for more systematic research into the multifaceted concept of companionship and sexuality in the older adult population. This review article addresses these two distinct subjects separately.", "Artificial intelligence has seen an incredibly fast development in recent years. Many novel technologies for property prediction of drug molecules as well as for the design of novel molecules were introduced by different research groups. These artificial intelligence-based design methods can be applied for suggesting novel chemical motifs in lead generation or scaffold hopping as well as for optimization of desired property profiles during lead optimization. In lead generation, broad sampling of the chemical space for identification of novel motifs is required, while in the lead optimization phase, a detailed exploration of the chemical neighborhood of a current lead series is advantageous. These different requirements for successful design outcomes render different combinations of artificial intelligence technologies useful. Overall, we observe that a combination of different approaches with tailored scoring and evaluation schemes appears beneficial for efficient artificial intelligence-based compound design.", "Less than 10% of the individuals seeking behavioral health care receive measurement-based care (MBC). Technology has the potential to implement MBC in a secure and efficient manner. To test this idea, a mobile health (mHealth) platform was developed with the goal of making MBC easier to deliver by clinicians and more accessible to patients within integrated behavioral health care. Data from over 3000 users of the mHealth platform were used to develop an output severity score, a robust screening measure for depression and anxiety.\nThe aim of this study is to compare severity scores with scores from validated assessments for depression and anxiety and scores from clinician review to evaluate the potential added value of this new measure.\nThe severity score uses patient-reported and passively collected data related to behavioral health on an mHealth platform. An artificial intelligence-derived algorithm was developed that condenses behavioral health data into a single, quantifiable measure for longitudinal tracking of an individual's depression and anxiety symptoms. Linear regression and Bland-Altman analyses were used to evaluate the relationships and differences between severity scores and Personal Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) or Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) scores from over 35,000 mHealth platform users. The severity score was also compared with a review by a panel of expert clinicians for a subset of 250 individuals.\nLinear regression results showed a strong correlation between the severity score and PHQ-9 (r=0.74; P<.001) and GAD-7 (r=0.80; P<.001) changes. A strong positive correlation was also found between the severity score and expert panel clinical review (r=0.80-0.84; P<.001). However, Bland-Altman analysis and the evaluation of outliers on regression analysis showed that the severity score was significantly different from the PHQ-9.\nClinicians can reliably use the mHealth severity score as a proxy measure for screening and monitoring behavioral health symptoms longitudinally. The severity score may identify at-risk individuals who are not identified by the PHQ-9. Further research is warranted to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the severity score.", "With the advent of the big data era, the application of artificial intelligence represented by deep learning in medicine has become a hot topic.

Generalizing scalability to larger pharmaceutical problems instead of specialization is now the main principle for transforming pharmaceutical tasks on multiple fronts, for which systematic and cost-effective solutions have benefited in areas such as molecular screening, synthetic pathway design, and drug discovery and development.The information generated by coupling the life cycle of drugs and AI and/or QC through data-driven analysis, neural network prediction, and chemical system monitoring will enable (1) better understanding of the complexity of process data, (2) streamlining the design of experiments, (3) discovering new molecular targets and materials, and also (4) planning or rethinking upcoming pharmaceutical challenges The power of AI-QC makes accessible a range of different pharmaceutical problems and their rationalization that have not been previously addressed due to a lack of appropriate analytical tools, demonstrating the breadth of potential applications of these emerging multidimensional approaches. In this context, creating the right AI-QC strategy often involves a steep learning path, especially given the embryonic stage of the industry development and the relative lack of case studies documenting success. As such, a comprehensive knowledge of the underlying pillars is imperative to extend the landscape of applications across the drug life cycle.The topics enclosed in this chapter will focus on AI-QC methods applied to drug discovery and development, with emphasis on the most recent advances in this field.", "Delineation of clinical target volume (CTV) and organs at risk (OARs) is important for radiotherapy but is time-consuming. We trained and evaluated a U-ResNet model to provide fast and consistent auto-segmentation.\nWe collected 160 patients' CT scans with breast cancer who underwent breast-conserving surgery (BCS) and were treated with radiotherapy. CTV and OARs were delineated manually and were used for model training. The dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and 95th percentile Hausdorff distance (95HD) were used to assess the performance of our model. CTV and OARs were randomly selected as ground truth (GT) masks, and artificial intelligence (AI) masks were generated by the proposed model. Two clinicians randomly compared CTV score differences of the contour. The consistency between two clinicians was tested. Time cost for auto-delineation was evaluated.\nThe mean DSC values of the proposed method were 0.94, 0.95, 0.94, 0.96, 0.96 and 0.93 for breast CTV, contralateral breast, heart, right lung, left lung and spinal cord, respectively. The mean 95HD values were 4.31mm, 3.59mm, 4.86mm, 3.18mm, 2.79mm and 4.37mm for the above structures, respectively. The average CTV scores for AI and GT were 2.89 versus 2.92 when evaluated by oncologist A (P=0.612), and 2.75 versus 2.83 by oncologist B (P=0.213), with no statistically significant differences. The consistency between two clinicians was poor (kappa=0.282). The time for auto-segmentation of CTV and OARs was 10.03 s.\nOur proposed model (U-ResNet) can improve the efficiency and accuracy of delineation compared with U-Net, performing equally well with the segmentation generated by oncologists.", "Many languages use the same letters to represent different sounds (e.g., the letter P represents /p/ in English but /r/ in Russian). We report two experiments that examine how native language experience impacts the acquisition and processing of words with conflicting letter-to-sound mappings. Experiment 1 revealed that individual differences in nonverbal intelligence predicted word learning and that novel words with conflicting orthography-to-phonology mappings were harder to learn when their spelling was more typical of the native language than less typical (due to increased competition from the native language). Notably, Experiment 2 used eye tracking to reveal, for the first time, that hearing non-native spoken words activates native language orthography and both native and non-native letter-to-sound mappings. These findings evince high interactivity in the language system, illustrate the role of orthography in phonological learning and processing, and demonstrate that experience with written form changes the linguistic mind.", "Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) provides a non-invasive method to obtain angiography of the chorioretinal vasculature leading to its recent widespread adoption. With a growing number of studies exploring the use of OCTA, various biomarkers quantifying the vascular characteristics have come to light. In the current report, we summarize the biomarkers currently described for retinal and choroidal vasculature using OCTA systems and the methods used to obtain them. Further, we present a critical review of these methods and key findings in common retinal diseases and appraise future directions, including applications of artificial intelligence in OCTA .", "Congenital hypothyroidism is one of the common diseases causing delayed intelligence development and growth retardation in children.

The development of the IoT has been broadly adopted in the construction of intelligent environments. There are various challenging IoT issues such as routing messages, addressing, Localizing nodes, data blending, etc. Formerly learning eloquent information from big data systems to construct a data-gathering setup in an IoT environment is challenging. Among many viable data sources, the IoT is a rich big data source: Various IoT nodes produce a massive quantity of data. Localization is one of the crucial problems that make a significant impact inside the IoT system. It needs to be engaged with proper and effective procedures to collect all sorts of data without noise. Numerous localization procedures and schemes have been initiated by deploying the IoT sensor with wireless sensor networks for both interior and outside environments. To accomplish higher localization accuracy, with less cost for the large volume of data, it is considered a hectic task in the IoT sensor environment. By viewing the nature of the IoT, the merging of different technologies such as the internet, WiFi, etc., can aid diverse ways to acquire information about various objects' locations. Location-based service is an exceptional service of the IoT, whereas localization accuracy is a significant issue. The data generated from the sensor are available in both static and dynamic forms. In this article, a sophisticated accuracy localization scheme for big data is proposed with an optimization approach that can effectively produce proper and effective outcomes for IoT environments. The theme of the article is to develop an enriched Swarm Intelligence algorithm based on Artificial Bee Colony by using the EKF (Extended Kalman Filter) data blend technique for improving Localization in IoT for the unsuspecting environment. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated by using communication consumption and Localization accuracy and its comparative advantage.", "The long-term impact of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) exposure on offspring health is an emerging research area. The objective of this study was to evaluate the association between a maternal diagnosis of HDP (gestational hypertension and preeclampsia) and adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes in the offspring.\nThis was a secondary analysis of two parallel multicenter clinical trials of thyroxine therapy for subclinical hypothyroid disorders in pregnancy. Women with singleton nonanomalous gestations diagnosed with subclinical hypothyroidism or hypothyroxinemia were randomized to thyroxine therapy or placebo. The primary outcome was child intelligence quotient (IQ) at 5 years of age. Secondary outcomes included several neurodevelopmental measures, including the Bayley-III cognitive, motor, and language scores at 12 and 24 months, Differential Ability Scales-II (DAS-II) scores at 36 months, the Conners' rating scales-revised at 48 months, and scores from the Child Behavior Checklist at 36 and 60 months. Thyroxine therapy did not influence neurodevelopment in either of the primary studies. Associations between neurodevelopment outcomes and maternal HDP were examined using univariable and multivariable analyses.\nA total of 112 woman-child dyads with HDP were compared with 1,067 woman-child dyads without HDP. In univariable analysis, mean maternal age (26.7\u2009\u00b1\u20095.9 vs. 27.8\u2009\u00b1\u20095.7 years, p\u2009=\u20090.032) and the frequency of nulliparity (45.5 vs. 31.0%, p\u2009=\u20090.002) differed significantly between the two groups. Maternal socioeconomic characteristics did not differ between the groups. After adjusting for potential confounders, there were no significant differences in any primary or secondary neurodevelopment outcome between offspring exposed to HDP and those unexposed. However, when dichotomized as low or high scores, we found higher rates of language delay (language scores <85: -1 standard deviation) at 2 years of age among offspring exposed to HDP compared with those unexposed (46.5 vs. 30.5%, adjusted odds ratio\u2009=\u20092.22, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.44-3.42).\nIn this cohort of pregnant women, HDP diagnosis was associated with language delay at 2 years of age. However, other long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes in offspring were not associated with HDP.\n\u00b7 No differences were found in neurodevelopment between offspring exposed to HDP and controls.. \u00b7 Higher rates of language delay at 2 years of age were found in offspring exposed to HDP.. \u00b7 The results did not differ when analysis was stratified by preterm birth..", "The year 2019 has seen an emergence of the novel coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causing coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19). Since the onset of the pandemic, biological and interdisciplinary research is being carried out across the world at a rapid pace to beat the pandemic. There is an increased need to comprehensively understand various aspects of the virus from detection to treatment options including drugs and vaccines for effective global management of the disease. In this review, we summarize the salient findings pertaining to SARS-CoV-2 biology, including symptoms, hosts, epidemiology, SARS-CoV-2 genome, and its emerging variants, viral diagnostics, host-pathogen interactions, alternative antiviral strategies and application of machine learning heuristics and artificial intelligence for effective management of COVID-19 and future pandemics.", "Emotional Intelligence (EI) is an important skill within the various health care professions, and a higher level of EI is associated with better patient care, communication, empathy and teamwork. Within the Republic of South Africa, there is limited literature on EI within the health care sector, and specifically within radiography.\nThe Trait EI Questionnaire Short Form (TEIQue-SF) was used to record the EI scores of 247 BHSc Radiography students in all four disciplines over the four years of study at the selected University of Technology (UoT) in Kwazulu-Natal (KZN), South Africa. The TEIQue-SF yields a Global EI score and the four factors of EI.\nThe study benchmarked the TEI scores of the radiography cohort. The male participants scored significantly higher in Global EI (p\u00a0=\u00a00.020 and 0.029) and the Self-control factor (p\u00a0=\u00a00.000) of EI compared to the female participants. The younger participants scored significantly higher in three of the five factors of TEI, namely: Global EI (p\u00a0=\u00a00.003), Well-being (p\u00a0=\u00a00.003) and Self-control (p\u00a0=\u00a00.010), which was an unexpected finding and against the norm. Racially (0.010 and 0.009) and culturally (P\u00a0=\u00a00.022 and 0.026), the Black participants and the Zulu participants scored significantly higher in the Self-control factor of TEI.\nThis study benchmarked the TEI scores of radiography students within KZN and compared these TEI scores to the demographic variances of the students with interesting results. This study has highlighted the TEI level of the students at a selected UoT, which can be used to ensure that better prepared, well-rounded and employable graduates enter the workplace. This can be achieved by the implementation of the recommendations, which includes the levels of EI to be developed and relevant EI training required. Further research is required within the field of TEI and Radiography in the South African context to strengthen this study's findings.\nThis study has highlighted the EI scores of a cohort of radiography students. The results of this study have made the institution more aware of the students' TEI which will allow the institution to ensure students are better prepared and are employable graduates within their chosen profession by including EI training within the health faculty curriculum.", "The fifth version of Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children is designed to measure five distinct aspects of intelligence, incorporating a new fluid reasoning index to the four indexes of the previous fourth version. Several factor analyses, however, have failed to support the fifth factor. The Scandinavian version is the only national version not showing clear superiority for the five-factor solution in the Manual. In the present study, we analyze WISC-V protocols from a clinical sample of 237 children tested with the new Scandinavian version. We perform six confirmatory factor analyses (CFA) testing three hierarchical-, two bifactor-, and one correlated candidate factor models. The study shows that the three-factor model does not fit the data, and that all four- and five-factor models showed good fit. The four-factor bifactor model was somewhat better than the five-bifactor and hierarchical models, but the correlated five-factor model was the superior model. Finding support for five-factors in a clinical sample representative of those most probable to be tested with the test, strengthen the claim that also the Scandinavian version measure a distinct fluid factor as intended by the test owners, and thus that clinicians may use the index scores as their main level of analysis. Review of previous CFAs show that the choice of statistical methods for CFA, bifactor or hierarchical/correlated, influence whether second order factor models are better than g-factor models.", "Computed tomography (CT) is emerging as a prominent diagnostic modality in the field of cardiovascular imaging. Artificial intelligence (AI) is making significant strides in the field of information technology, the commercial industry, and health care. Machine learning (ML), a branch of AI, can optimize the performance of CT and augment the assessment of coronary artery disease. These ML platforms can automate multiple tasks, perform calculations, and integrate information from a variety of data sources. In this review article, we explore the ML in CT imaging.", "Departing from popular imaginations around artificial intelligence (AI), this article engages in the I in the AI acronym but from perspectives outside of mathematics, computer science and machine learning. When intelligence is attended to here, it most often refers to narrow calculating tasks. This connotation to calculation provides AI an image of scientificity and objectivity, particularly attractive in societies with a pervasive desire for numbers. However, as is increasingly apparent today, when employed in more general areas of our messy socio-cultural realities, AI- powered automated systems often fail or have unintended consequences. This article will contribute to this critique of AI by attending to Nicholas of Cusa and his treatment of intelligence. According to him, intelligence is equally dependent on an ability to handle the unknown as it unfolds in the present moment. This suggests that intelligence is organic which ties Cusa to more contemporary discussions in tech philosophy, neurology, evolutionary biology, and cognitive sciences in which it is argued that intelligence is dependent on having-and acting through-an organic body. Understanding intelligence as organic thus suggests an oxymoronic relationship to artificial.", "Colorectal cancer is one of the most common malignancies among the general population. Artificial Intelligence methodologies based on serum parameters are in continuous development to obtain less expensive tools for highly sensitive diagnoses. This study proposes a predictive system based on serum biomarkers and ensemble learning to predict colorectal cancer presence and the related TNM stage in patients.\nWe have selected 17 significant plasmatic proteins, i.e., Carcinoembryonic Antigen, CA 19-9, CA 125, CA 50, CA 72-4, Tissue Polypeptide Antigen, C-Reactive Protein, Ceruloplasmin, Haptoglobin, Transferrin, Ferritin, \u03b1-1-Antitrypsin, \u03b1-2-Macroglobulin, \u03b1-1 Acid Glycoprotein, Complement C4, Complement C3, and Retinol Binding Protein, regarding 345 patients (248 affected by the neoplastic disease). The proposed system consists of two predictors, i.e., binary and staging; the former predicts the presence/absence of cancer, while the latter identifies the related TNM stage (I, II, III, or IV). The experiments were conducted by deploying and comparing Random Forest, XGBoost, Support Vector Machine, and Multilayer Perceptron with feature selection based on Gini Importance and with dimensionality reduction via PCA.\nThe results show that the system composed of XGBoost as binary and staging predictor reaches 91.30% accuracy, 90% sensitivity, and 93.33% specificity for the absence/presence outcome, while 66.66% accuracy for the staging response. With the expansion of the training set in favor of positive patients and majority voting, the system composed of the combination of Support Vector Machine, XGBoost, and Multilayer Perceptron as the binary predictor reaches 98.03% accuracy, 100% sensitivity, and 92.30% specificity, while the combination of Random Forest, XGBoost, and Multilayer Perceptron as staging predictor achieves 60% accuracy. The final system reaches, in terms of accuracy, 98.03%, and 66.66% for the binary and staging predictors, respectively. It was also found that the biomarkers which contribute most to the binary decision are Ceruloplasmin and \u03b1-2-Macroglobulin, while the least significant dimensions are CA 50 and \u03b1-1-Antitrypsin; instead, Carcinoembryonic Antigen and \u03b1-1 Acid Glycoprotein are the most significant to the staging decision.\nThe present study proves the effectiveness of deploying serum biomarkers as feature dimensions for early colorectal cancer diagnosis and of using majority voting for noise reduction in the prediction.", "Interpretation of breath sounds by auscultation has high inter-observer variability, even when performed by trained healthcare professionals. This can be mitigated by using Artificial Intelligence (AI) acoustic analysis. We aimed to develop and validate a novel breath sounds analysis system using AI-enabled algorithms to accurately interpret breath sounds in children. Subjects from the respiratory clinics and wards were auscultated by two independent respiratory paediatricians blinded to their clinical diagnosis. A novel device consisting of a stethoscope head connected to a smart phone recorded the breath sounds. The audio files were categorised into single label (normal, wheeze and crackles) or multi-label sounds. Together with commercially available breath sounds, an AI classifier was trained using machine learning. Unique features were identified to distinguish the breath sounds. Single label breath sound samples were used to validate the finalised Support Vector Machine classifier. Breath sound samples (73 single label, 20 multi-label) were collected from 93 children (mean age [SD]\u2009=\u20095.40 [4.07] years). Inter-rater concordance was observed in 81 (87.1%) samples. Performance of the classifier on the 73 single label breath sounds demonstrated 91% sensitivity and 95% specificity. The AI classifier developed could identify normal breath sounds, crackles and wheeze in children with high accuracy.", "A structural covariance network (SCN) has been used successfully in structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) studies. However, most SCNs have been constructed by a unitary marker that is insensitive for discriminating different disease phases. The aim of this study was to devise a novel regional radiomics similarity network (R2SN) that could provide more comprehensive information in morphological network analysis. R2SNs were constructed by computing the Pearson correlations between the radiomics features extracted from any pair of regions for each subject (AAL atlas). We further assessed the small-world property of R2SNs, and we evaluated the reproducibility in different datasets and through test-retest analysis. The relationships between the R2SNs and general intelligence/interregional coexpression of genes were also explored. R2SNs could be replicated in different datasets, regardless of the use of different feature subsets. R2SNs showed high reproducibility in the test-retest analysis (intraclass correlation coefficient > 0.7). In addition, the small-word property (\u03c3 > 2) and the high correlation between gene expression (R = 0.29, p < 0.001) and general intelligence were determined for R2SNs. Furthermore, the results have also been repeated in the Brainnetome atlas. R2SNs provide a novel, reliable, and biologically plausible method to understand human morphological covariance based on sMRI.", "The dynamics of neurons consist of oscillating patterns of a membrane potential that underpin the operation of biological intelligence. The FitzHugh-Nagumo (FHN) model for neuron excitability generates rich dynamical regimes with a simpler mathematical structure than the Hodgkin-Huxley model. Because neurons can be understood in terms of electrical and electrochemical methods, here we apply the analysis of the impedance response to obtain the characteristic spectra and their evolution as a function of applied voltage. We convert the two nonlinear differential equations of FHN into an equivalent circuit model, classify the different impedance spectra, and calculate the corresponding trajectories in the phase plane of the variables. In analogy to the field of electrochemical oscillators, impedance spectroscopy detects the Hopf bifurcations and the spiking regimes. We show that a neuron element needs three essential internal components: capacitor, inductor, and negative differential resistance. The method supports the fabrication of memristor-based artificial neural networks.", "The study examined the mediation moderated effects of spiritual intelligence and mindfulness on the relationship between emotional dysregulation, depression and mental well-being. It also investigated the mediating effects of mindfulness on the relationship between spiritual intelligence and mental well-being in persons with diabetes.\nA cross-sectional survey was carried out among 636 (age 32-74 years; mean = 40.31; SD = 8.40) people living with diabetes who are registered patients and were attending the clinic in Department of Endocrinology, Ondo State Specialist Hospital, Okitipupa and Federal Medical Centre, Lokoja. The data were analysed using Pearson Multiple correlation and mediation moderated model 29 and mediation model 4 of PROCESS macro.

The cellular mechanisms behind this event are not completely understood and existing predictive biomarkers are imperfect. Here, we used an end-to-end deep learning algorithm to identify risk factors for lymph node metastasis (LNM) status in digitized histopathology slides of the primary CRC and its surrounding tissue. In two large population-based cohorts, we show that this system can predict the presence of more than one LNM in pT2 CRC patients with an area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) of 0.733 (0.67-0.758) and patients with any LNM with an AUROC of 0.711 (0.597-0.797). Similarly, in pT1 CRC patients, the presence of more than one LNM or any LNM was predictable with an AUROC of 0.733 (0.644-0.778) and 0.567 (0.542-0.597), respectively. Based on these findings, we used the deep learning system to guide human pathology experts towards highly predictive regions for LNM in the whole slide images. This hybrid human observer and deep learning approach identified inflamed adipose tissue as the highest predictive feature for LNM presence. Our study is a first proof of concept that artificial intelligence (AI) systems may be able to discover potentially new biological mechanisms in cancer progression. Our deep learning algorithm is publicly available and can be used for biomarker discovery in any disease setting. \u00a9 2021 The Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.

The treatment response was evaluated using the Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria. Tumor-associated edema was evaluated with T2WI magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and quantitative T2 mapping sequence, and an Edema Regression Index was designed to quantify volumetric changes in edema imaging after every treatment cycle. Cognitive intelligence state and quality of life were evaluated using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (QLQ-C30).\nRadiologically, the partial response rate was 78.5% in the BEV + TMZ group and 38.3% in the TMZ group. After the first cycle of treatment, the mean score of the MMSE was 21.1\u00b12.0 and 24.1\u00b11.4 (P<0.001) in the TMZ group and the BEV + TMZ group, respectively. In the functioning domains of the QLQ-C30, scales of physical functioning, emotional functioning and cognitive functioning were 43.0\u00b17.0 vs. 61.7\u00b112.5 (P<0.001), 44.5\u00b18.8 vs. 63.4\u00b16.9 (P<0.001) and 42.4\u00b18.8 vs. 63.7\u00b112.0 (P<0.001) in the TMZ group and the BEV + TMZ group, respectively. In the BEV + TMZ group, a correlation between the Edema Regression Index and improvement in cognitive status and quality of life was observed. Patients with Edema Regression Index scores higher than 50% gained a 25.6% increase in the mean MMSE score from 19.9\u00b11.6 to 25.0\u00b11.1 (P<0.001). In the BEV + TMZ group, physical functioning, emotional functioning, and cognitive functioning increased by 76.8%, 53.1%, and 81.5%, respectively, while scores of nausea/vomiting decreased by 40.3% to 32.1. Patients with no evident edema observed in the pre-BEV MRI scans were given a prolonged four-cycle course of BEV. No significant improvement was observed in the MMSE score and the QLQ score with additional cycles of BEV.\nA close relationship was observed between Edema Regression Index and a change in cognitive function in patients treated with BEV and TMZ. Compared with TMZ alone, the combination of TMZ and BEV could improve the cognitive function and quality of life of patients with recurrent high-grade gliomas. The Edema Regression Index could be used as a surrogate imaging biomarker to predict patients who may or may not gain cognitive benefit from the combination therapy of TMZ and BEV, which warrants further prospective clinical studies for validation.", "The goal of this study was to systematically review the usefulness of serum biomarkers in the setting of ischemic stroke (IS) to predict long-term outcome.\nA systematic literature review was performed using the PubMed and MEDLINE databases for studies published between 1986 and 2018. All studies assessing long-term functional outcome (defined as \u226530 days) after IS with respect to serum biomarkers were included. Data were extracted and pooled using a meta-analysis of odds ratios.\nOf the 2928 articles in the original literature search, 183 studies were selected. A total of 127 serum biomarkers were included. Biomarkers were grouped into several categories: inflammatory (n\u00a0= 32), peptide/enzymatic (n\u00a0= 30), oxidative/metabolic (n\u00a0= 28), hormone/steroid based (n\u00a0= 23), and hematologic/vascular (n\u00a0= 14). The most commonly studied biomarkers in each category were found to be CRP, S100\u03b2, albumin, copeptin, and D-dimer. With the exception of S100\u03b2, all were found to be statistically associated with >30-day outcome after ischemic stroke.\nSerum-based biomarkers have the potential to predict functional outcome in patients with IS. This meta-analysis has identified C-reactive protein, albumin, copeptin, and D-dimer to be significantly associated with long-term outcome after IS. These biomarkers have the potential to serve as a platform for prognosticating stroke outcomes after 30 days. These serum biomarkers, some of which are routinely ordered, can be combined with imaging biomarkers and used in artificial intelligence algorithms to provide refined predictive outcomes after injury. These tools will assist physicians in providing guidance to families regarding long-term independence of patients.", "Arsenic (As), and fluoride (F-) are potent contaminants with established carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic impacts on the exposed populations globally. Despite elevated groundwater As and F- levels being reported from various regions of Pakistan no biomonitoring study has been reported yet to address the co-exposure impact of As and F- among school children. We aimed to investigate the effects of these two contaminants on dental fluorosis and intelligence quotient (IQ) along with the induction of oxidative stress in rural children under co-exposed conditions. A total of 148 children (5 to 16\u00a0years old) from the exposed and control group were recruited in the current study from endemic rural areas of Lahore and Kasur districts, Pakistan having elevated As and F- levels in drinking water than permissible limits. We monitored malondialdehyde and its probable association with antioxidants activity (SOD, CAT, and GR) as a biomarker of oxidative stress. GSTM1/T1 polymorphisms were measured to find the impact of As on health parameters. Mean urinary concentrations of As (2.70 vs. 0.016\u00a0\u00b5g/L, P\u2009<\u20090.000) and F- (3.27 vs. 0.24\u00a0mg/L, P\u2009<\u20090.000) as well as the frequency of dental fluorosis were found elevated among the exposed group. The cases of children with lower IQ were observed high in the exposed group. Additionally, lower concentrations of antioxidants (SOD, CAT, and GR) were found suggesting high susceptibility to F- toxicity. The findings suggest that F- accounted for high variations in health parameters of children under the co-exposure conditions with As.", "A variety of emerging medical imaging technologies based on artificial intelligence have been widely applied in many diseases, but they are still limitedly used in the cerebrovascular field even though the diseases can lead to catastrophic consequences.\nThis work aims to discuss the current challenges and future directions of artificial intelligence technology in cerebrovascular diseases through reviewing the existing literature related to applications in terms of computer-aided detection, prediction and treatment of cerebrovascular diseases.\nBased on artificial intelligence applications in four representative cerebrovascular diseases including intracranial aneurysm, arteriovenous malformation, arteriosclerosis and moyamoya disease, this paper systematically reviews studies published between 2006 and 2021 in five databases: National Center for Biotechnology Information, Elsevier Science Direct, IEEE Xplore Digital Library, Web of Science and Springer Link. And three refinement steps were further conducted after identifying relevant literature from these databases.\nFor the popular research topic, most of the included publications involved computer-aided detection and prediction of aneurysms, while studies about arteriovenous malformation, arteriosclerosis and moyamoya disease showed an upward trend in recent years. Both conventional machine learning and deep learning algorithms were utilized in these publications, but machine learning techniques accounted for a larger proportion.\nAlgorithms related to artificial intelligence, especially deep learning, are promising tools for medical imaging analysis and will enhance the performance of computer-aided detection, prediction and treatment of cerebrovascular diseases.", "In the era of big data, artificial intelligence (AI), and the Internet of Things (IoT), digital data have become essential for our everyday functioning and in health care services. The sensitive nature of health care data presents several crucial issues such as privacy, security, interoperability, and reliability that must be addressed in any health care data management system. However, most of the current health care systems are still facing major obstacles and are lacking in some of these areas. This is where decentralized, secure, and scalable databases, most notably blockchains, play critical roles in addressing these requirements without compromising security, thereby attracting considerable interest within the health care community. A blockchain can be maintained and widely distributed using a large network of nodes, mostly computers, each of which stores a full replica of the data. A blockchain protocol is a set of predefined rules or procedures that govern how the nodes interact with the network, view, verify, and add data to the ledger.\nIn this article, we aim to explore blockchain technology, its framework, current applications, and integration with other innovations, as well as opportunities in diverse areas of health care and clinical research, in addition to clarifying its future impact on the health care ecosystem. We also elucidate 2 case studies to instantiate the potential role of blockchains in health care.\nTo identify related existing work, terms based on Medical Subject Headings were used. We included studies focusing mainly on health care and clinical research and developed a functional framework for implementation and testing with data. The literature sources for this systematic review were PubMed, Medline, and the Cochrane library, in addition to a preliminary search of IEEE Xplore.\nThe included studies demonstrated multiple framework designs and various implementations in health care including chronic disease diagnosis, management, monitoring, and evaluation. We found that blockchains exhibit many promising applications in clinical trial management such as smart-contract application, participant-controlled data access, trustless protocols, and data validity. Electronic health records (EHRs), patient-centered interoperability, remote patient monitoring, and clinical trial data management were found to be major areas for blockchain usage, which can become a key catalyst for health care innovations.\nThe potential benefits of blockchains are limitless; however, concrete data on long-term clinical outcomes based on blockchains powered and supplemented by AI and IoT are yet to be obtained. Nonetheless, implementing blockchains as a novel way to integrate EHRs nationwide and manage common clinical problems in an algorithmic fashion has the potential for improving patient outcomes, health care experiences, as well as the overall health and well-being of individuals.", "Smartphone technology is advancing at a rapid pace. Their role in day-to-day life is becoming more and more intricate and irreplaceable. Of late, they have gained immense importance in different medical specialities where they possess an active ability to guide the clinician. This is particularly evident in ophthalmology, where the constantly evolving camera-illumination systems and the artificial intelligence integrated technology have unravelled many novel observations for non-contact posterior segment imaging. The scope of this review is to highlight the role of smartphones as ophthalmoscopes (direct as well as indirect). Nevertheless, their limitations and future directions are also stated here with the intention of making progress in the field of smartphone fundus imaging.", "RNA viruses have high rate of replication and mutation that help them adapt and change according to their environmental conditions. Many viral mutants are the cause of various severe and lethal diseases. Vaccines, on the other hand have the capacity to protect us from infectious diseases by eliciting antibody or cell-mediated immune responses that are pathogen-specific. While there are a few reviews pertaining to the use of artificial intelligence (AI) for SARS-COV-2 vaccine development, none focus on peptide vaccination for RNA viruses and the important role played by AI in it. Peptide vaccine which is slowly coming to be recognized as a safe and effective vaccination strategy has the capacity to overcome the mutant escape problem which is also being currently faced by SARS-COV-2 vaccines in circulation.Here we review the present scenario of peptide vaccines which are developed using mathematical and computational statistics methods to prevent the spread of disease caused by RNA viruses. We also focus on the importance and current stage of AI and mathematical evolutionary modeling using machine learning tools in the establishment of these new peptide vaccines for the control of viral disease.", "Comprehensive clinical, pathological, and molecular data, when appropriately integrated with advanced computational approaches, are transforming the way we characterize and study lung cancer. Clinically, cancer registry and publicly available historical clinical trial data enable retrospective analyses to examine how socioeconomic factors, patient demographics, and cancer characteristics affect treatment and outcome. Pathologically, digital pathology and artificial intelligence are revolutionizing histopathological image analyses, not only with improved efficiency and accuracy, but also by extracting additional information for prognostication and tumor microenvironment characterization. Genetically and molecularly, individual patient tumors and preclinical models of lung cancer are profiled by various high-throughput platforms to characterize the molecular properties and functional liabilities. The resulting multi-omics data sets and their interrogation facilitate both basic research mechanistic studies and translation of the findings into the clinic. In this review, we provide a list of resources and tools potentially valuable for lung cancer basic and translational research. Importantly, we point out pitfalls and caveats when performing computational analyses of these data sets and provide a vision of future computational biology developments that will aid lung cancer translational research.", "Data science continues to be recognized and used within healthcare due to the increased availability of large data sets and advanced analytics. It can be challenging for nurse leaders to remain apprised of this rapidly changing landscape. In this article, we describe our findings from a scoping literature review of papers published in 2019 that use data science to explore, explain, and/or predict 15 phenomena of interest to nurses. Fourteen of the 15 phenomena were associated with at least one paper published in 2019. We identified the use of many contemporary data science methods (eg, natural language processing, neural networks) for many of the outcomes. We found many studies exploring Readmissions and Pressure Injuries. The topics of Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning Acceptance, Burnout, Patient Safety, and Unit Culture were poorly represented. We hope that the studies described in this article help readers: (1) understand the breadth and depth of data science's ability to improve clinical processes and patient outcomes that are relevant to nurses and (2) identify gaps in the literature that are in need of exploration.", "Challenges of health systems in Latin America and the Caribbean include accessibility, inequity, segmentation, and poverty. These challenges are similar in different countries of the region and transcend national borders. The increasing digital transformation of health care holds promise of more precise interventions, improved health outcomes, increased efficiency, and ultimately reduced health-care costs. In Latin America and the Caribbean, the adoption of digital health tools is in early stages and the quality of cancer registries, electronic health records, and structured databases are problematic. Cancer research and innovation in the region are limited due to inadequate academic resources and translational research is almost fully dependent on public funding. Regulatory complexity and extended timelines jeopardise the potential improvement in participation in international studies. Emerging technologies, artificial intelligence, big data, and cancer research represent an opportunity to address the health-care challenges in Latin America and the Caribbean collectively, by optimising national capacities, sharing and comparing best practices, and transferring scientific and technical capabilities.", "Although significant advancements in computer-aided diagnostics using artificial intelligence (AI) have been made, to date, no viable method for radiation-induced skin reaction (RISR) analysis and classification is available. The objective of this single-center study was to develop machine learning and deep learning approaches using deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for automatic classification of RISRs according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grading system. Scarletred\u24c7 Vision, a novel and state-of-the-art digital skin imaging method capable of remote monitoring and objective assessment of acute RISRs was used to convert 2D digital skin images using the CIELAB color space and conduct SEV* measurements. A set of different machine learning and deep convolutional neural network-based algorithms has been explored for the automatic classification of RISRs. A total of 2263 distinct images from 209 patients were analyzed for training and testing the machine learning and CNN algorithms. For a 2-class problem of healthy skin (grade 0) versus erythema (grade \u2265 1), all machine learning models produced an accuracy of above 70%, and the sensitivity and specificity of erythema recognition were 67-72% and 72-83%, respectively. The CNN produced a test accuracy of 74%, sensitivity of 66%, and specificity of 83% for predicting healthy and erythema cases. For the severity grade prediction of a 3-class problem (grade 0 versus 1 versus 2), the overall test accuracy was 60-67%, and the sensitivities were 56-82%, 35-59%, and 65-72%, respectively. For estimating the severity grade of each class, the CNN obtained an accuracy of 73%, 66%, and 82%, respectively. Ensemble learning combines several individual predictions to obtain a better generalization performance. Furthermore, we exploited ensemble learning by deploying a CNN model as a meta-learner. The ensemble CNN based on bagging and majority voting shows an accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of 87%, 90%, and 82% for a 2-class problem, respectively. For a 3-class problem, the ensemble CNN shows an overall accuracy of 66%, while for each grade (0, 1, and 2) accuracies were 76%, 69%, and 87%, sensitivities were 70%, 57%, and 71%, and specificities were 78%, 75%, and 95%, respectively. This study is the first to focus on erythema in radiation-dermatitis and produces benchmark results using machine learning models. The outcome of this study validates that the proposed system can act as a pre-screening and decision support tool for oncologists or patients to provide fast, reliable, and efficient assessment of erythema grading.", "Artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled analysis of 12-lead ECGs may facilitate efficient estimation of incident atrial fibrillation (AF) risk. However, it remains unclear whether AI provides meaningful and generalizable improvement in predictive accuracy beyond clinical risk factors for AF.\nWe trained a convolutional neural network (ECG-AI) to infer 5-year incident AF risk using 12-lead ECGs in patients receiving longitudinal primary care at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH). We then fit 3 Cox proportional hazards models, composed of ECG-AI 5-year AF probability, CHARGE-AF clinical risk score (Cohorts for Heart and Aging in Genomic Epidemiology-Atrial Fibrillation), and terms for both ECG-AI and CHARGE-AF (CH-AI), respectively. We assessed model performance by calculating discrimination (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve) and calibration in an internal test set and 2 external test sets (Brigham and Women's Hospital [BWH] and UK Biobank). Models were recalibrated to estimate 2-year AF risk in the UK Biobank given limited available follow-up. We used saliency mapping to identify ECG features most influential on ECG-AI risk predictions and assessed correlation between ECG-AI and CHARGE-AF linear predictors.\nThe training set comprised 45\u2009770 individuals (age 55\u00b117 years, 53% women, 2171 AF events) and the test sets comprised 83\u2009162 individuals (age 59\u00b113 years, 56% women, 2424 AF events). Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was comparable using CHARGE-AF (MGH, 0.802 [95% CI, 0.767-0.836]; BWH, 0.752 [95% CI, 0.741-0.763]; UK Biobank, 0.732 [95% CI, 0.704-0.759]) and ECG-AI (MGH, 0.823 [95% CI, 0.790-0.856]; BWH, 0.747 [95% CI, 0.736-0.759]; UK Biobank, 0.705 [95% CI, 0.673-0.737]). Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was highest using CH-AI (MGH, 0.838 [95% CI, 0.807 to 0.869]; BWH, 0.777 [95% CI, 0.766 to 0.788]; UK Biobank, 0.746 [95% CI, 0.716 to 0.776]). Calibration error was low using ECG-AI (MGH, 0.0212; BWH, 0.0129; UK Biobank, 0.0035) and CH-AI (MGH, 0.012; BWH, 0.0108; UK Biobank, 0.0001). In saliency analyses, the ECG P-wave had the greatest influence on AI model predictions. ECG-AI and CHARGE-AF linear predictors were correlated (Pearson r: MGH, 0.61; BWH, 0.66; UK Biobank, 0.41).\nAI-based analysis of 12-lead ECGs has similar predictive usefulness to a clinical risk factor model for incident AF and the approaches are complementary. ECG-AI may enable efficient quantification of future AF risk.", "The concept of the ischemic penumbra was defined over 40 years ago by Lindsay Symon and his group and is now an established principle of all acute ischemic stroke therapies. These reperfusion treatments rescue threatened, critically hypoperfused brain tissue and have been proven to improve clinical outcomes. We have been fortunate to have observed and played a small part in the penumbral story from its beginnings in the 1970s to its pivotal position today. Over this period, we have witnessed penumbral imaging evolve from positron emission tomography through to magnetic resonance imaging and now predominantly computed tomography perfusion, with the advent of automated imaging facilitating case selection for reperfusion therapies. We and others have conducted clinical trials using penumbral imaging to extend the time window for intravenous thrombolysis and select patients for thrombectomy. Together with the concept of fast- and slow-growing ischemic infarct patterns, this embeds the penumbral principle in everyday clinical management. The opportunity now exists to make penumbral imaging even more portable, affordable, and more widely available using mobile platforms, novel imaging techniques, digital linkage, and artificial intelligence.", "With concerns that artificial intelligence may replace existing jobs, job insecurity is becoming more prevalent. In-depth study of how job insecurity affects our society has become an important research topic. This study investigates the internal mechanisms through which such job insecurity influences workplace harassment. Based on the theories of psychological contract breach and the conservation of resources, this study proposes an indirect effect of job insecurity and a three-way moderation effect of hypercompetitive attitude, perceived coworker impression management, and leader narcissism on aggression intention. Using survey data from 286 employees in South Korea, bootstrapping analysis, hierarchical regression analysis, and a slope-difference test were performed to confirm the mediation and moderation effects. The results showed that hypercompetitive attitude mediates the association between job insecurity and aggression intention. The three-way interaction effect was also confirmed, such that the interaction effect of hypercompetitive attitude and coworker impression management is only effective when leader narcissism is high. This study contributes to the literature and business practices by offering significant suggestions to aid a more in-depth understanding of the workplace harassment occurrence process.", "Time series classification (TSC) is a pervasive and transversal problem in various fields ranging from disease diagnosis to anomaly detection in finance. Unfortunately, the most effective models used by Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems for TSC are not interpretable and hide the logic of the decision process, making them unusable in sensitive domains. Recent research is focusing on explanation methods to pair with the obscure classifier to recover this weakness. However, a TSC approach that is transparent by design and is simultaneously efficient and effective is even more preferable. To this aim, we propose an interpretable TSC method based on the patterns, which is possible to extract from the Matrix Profile (MP) of the time series in the training set. A smart design of the classification procedure allows obtaining an efficient and effective transparent classifier modeled as a decision tree that expresses the reasons for the classification as the presence of discriminative subsequences. Quantitative and qualitative experimentation shows that the proposed method overcomes the state-of-the-art interpretable approaches.", "Cardiovascular disease is a serious threat to human health, and early risk prediction of major adverse cardiovascular event in people suspected of coronary heart disease can help guide prevention and clinical decisions. Coronary computed tomography (CT) is a useful imaging tool for evaluation of coronary heart disease, and its ability to reflect coronary atherosclerosis shows potential value for risk prediction. In recent years, various new techniques and studies of coronary CT have emerged for risk prediction of major adverse cardiovascular event in people suspected of coronary heart disease. We will review the background and current study advances of using coronary artery calcium score, coronary CT angiography, and artificial intelligence in this field.", "The COVID-19 pandemic has required psychiatric and mental health professionals to change their practices to reduce the risk of transmission of SARS-CoV-2, in particular by favoring remote monitoring and assessment via digital technologies.\nAs part of a research project that was cofunded by the French National Research Agency (ARN) and the Centre-Val de Loire Region, the aim of this systematic literature review was to investigate how such uses of digital technologies have been developing.\nThis systematic review was conducted following the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. The search was carried out in the MEDLINE (ie, PubMed) and Cairn databases, as well as in a platform specializing in mental health, Ascodocpsy. The search yielded 558 results for the year 2020. After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, first on titles and abstracts and then on full texts, 61 articles were included.\nThe analysis of the literature revealed a heterogeneous integration of digital technologies, not only depending on countries, contexts, and local regulations, but also depending on the modalities of care. Notwithstanding these variations, the use of videoconferencing has developed significantly, affecting working conditions and therapeutic relationships. For many psychiatric and mental health professionals, the pandemic has been an opportunity to build up their experience of remote care and, thus, better identify the possibilities and limits of these digital technologies.\nNew uses of such technologies essentially consist of a transition from the classic consultation model toward teleconsultation and make less use of the specific potential of artificial intelligence. As professionals were not prepared for these uses, they were confronted with practical difficulties and ethical questions, such as the place of digital technology in care, confidentiality and protection of personal data, and equity in access to care. The COVID-19 health crisis questions how the organization of health care integrates the possibilities offered by digital technology, in particular to promote the autonomy and empowerment of mental health service users.", "Endoscopy has been a crucial part of the diagnostic and therapeutic modality in pediatric gastrointestinal disorders. This article outlines recent advances in pediatric gastrointestinal endoscopy, including transnasal endoscopy, functional luminal imaging probe, peroral endoscopic myotomy, mucosal impedance, endoscopic vacuum-assisted closure system, chromoendoscopy, artificial intelligence, and machine learning.", "Environmental problems are closely related to human activities, especially economic activities. Nevertheless, on a personal level, we do not face these problems and seem to avoid them. Why are environmental problems not taken seriously despite their urgency? As economic activities for self-profit, including money, are the essence of human behavior, we have hypothesized that, \"selfishness and endless desire are the essence of human beings' instinct for survival, and as a result, environmental destruction occurs\". In this paper, first, we describe through the prism of evolution how the \"selfish gene\" affects the survival of cells, individuals, and human society. At the same time, we detail how humans have developed the cerebrum, acquired intelligence, and developed science. Second, we describe the mechanism of modern capitalism and the global environmental situation at present. Third, we consider the relationship between human selfishness and environmental problems from three viewpoints: game theory, behavioral economics, and sociology. Finally, we propose countermeasures to environmental problems from three perspectives: social psychology, social system, and new technologies.", "The purpose of this study is to improve the English learning anxiety and learning effect for middle school students. From the perspective of educational psychology, the influence of vocalized reading practice on the English learning of students is studied based on the self-efficacy theory and the schema theory. To encourage the students to practice English, the study might solve the problem of insufficient opportunities by applying the artificial intelligence (AI) chat system to the oral English practice of the students. Several research hypotheses are put forward, which concern the correlation between the English learning anxiety of the students with their self-efficacy, topic familiarity, and English grades under vocalized reading practice. Then, the hypotheses are verified through a controlled trial and a questionnaire survey (QS). Afterward, the experimental and QS data are statistically analyzed and tested with a regression model. The results show that the English grades, self-efficacy, and topic familiarity of the students have been significantly improved in the experimental group after the vocalized reading practice. The significance coefficient of the regression model is P = 0.000 < 0.05, which can be used to verify the proposed hypotheses. The English grades, self-efficacy, and topic familiarity can well-predict the English learning anxiety of the students. The computer simulation in educational communication (CSIEC) teaching system and AI can help create an interactive learning environment for the students to practice oral English by chatting with AI robots.", "In an interview with Neuron, Yulong Li discusses optical tool development and next steps to interrogate the whole brain. He further shares the importance of interdisciplinarity; how new tools for neural imaging, perturbation, and artificial intelligence are revolutionizing neuroscience; and his inspirations from science fiction and a powerhouse scientific family.", "Ali-M3, an artificial intelligence program, analyzes chest computed tomography (CT) and detects the likelihood of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) based on scores ranging from 0 to 1. However, Ali-M3 has not been externally validated. Our aim was to evaluate the accuracy of Ali-M3 for detecting COVID-19 and discuss its clinical value. We evaluated the external validity of Ali-M3 using sequential Japanese sampling data. In this retrospective cohort study, COVID-19 infection probabilities for 617 symptomatic patients were determined using Ali-M3. In 11 Japanese tertiary care facilities, these patients underwent reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing. They also underwent chest CT to confirm a diagnosis of COVID-19. Of the 617 patients, 289 (46.8%) were RT-PCR-positive. The area under the curve (AUC) of Ali-M3 for predicting a COVID-19 diagnosis was 0.797 (95% confidence interval: 0.762\u20120.833) and the goodness-of-fit was P = 0.156. With a cut-off probability of a diagnosis of COVID-19 by Ali-M3 set at 0.5, the sensitivity and specificity were 80.6% and 68.3%, respectively. A cut-off of 0.2 yielded a sensitivity and specificity of 89.2% and 43.2%, respectively. Among the 223 patients who required oxygen, the AUC was 0.825. Sensitivity at a cut-off of 0.5% and 0.2% was 88.7% and 97.9%, respectively. Although the sensitivity was lower when the days from symptom onset were fewer, the sensitivity increased for both cut-off values after 5 days. We evaluated Ali-M3 using external validation with symptomatic patient data from Japanese tertiary care facilities. As Ali-M3 showed sufficient sensitivity performance, despite a lower specificity performance, Ali-M3 could be useful in excluding a diagnosis of COVID-19.", "The recent surge in clinical and nonclinical health-related data has been accompanied by a concomitant increase in personal health data (PHD) research across multiple disciplines such as medicine, computer science, and management. There is now a need to synthesize the dynamic knowledge of PHD in various disciplines to spot potential research hotspots.\nThe aim of this study was to reveal the knowledge evolutionary trends in PHD and detect potential research hotspots using bibliometric analysis.\nWe collected 8281 articles published between 2009 and 2018 from the Web of Science database. The knowledge evolution analysis (KEA) framework was used to analyze the evolution of PHD research. The KEA framework is a bibliometric approach that is based on 3 knowledge networks: reference co-citation, keyword co-occurrence, and discipline co-occurrence.\nThe findings show that the focus of PHD research has evolved from medicine centric to technology centric to human centric since 2009. The most active PHD knowledge cluster is developing knowledge resources and allocating scarce resources. The field of computer science, especially the topic of artificial intelligence (AI), has been the focal point of recent empirical studies on PHD. Topics related to psychology and human factors (eg, attitude, satisfaction, education) are also receiving more attention.\nOur analysis shows that PHD research has the potential to provide value-based health care in the future. All stakeholders should be educated about AI technology to promote value generation through PHD. Moreover, technology developers and health care institutions should consider human factors to facilitate the effective adoption of PHD-related technology. These findings indicate opportunities for interdisciplinary cooperation in several PHD research areas: (1) AI applications for PHD; (2) regulatory issues and governance of PHD; (3) education of all stakeholders about AI technology; and (4) value-based health care including \"allocative value,\" \"technology value,\" and \"personalized value.\"", "In this study, Artificial Intelligence was used to analyze a dataset containing the cortical thickness from 1,100 healthy individuals. This dataset had the cortical thickness from 31 regions in the left hemisphere of the brain as well as from 31 regions in the right hemisphere. Then, 62 artificial neural networks were trained and validated to estimate the number of neurons in the hidden layer. These neural networks were used to create a model for the cortical thickness through age for each region in the brain. Using the artificial neural networks and kernels with seven points, numerical differentiation was used to compute the derivative of the cortical thickness with respect to age. The derivative was computed to estimate the cortical thickness speed. Finally, color bands were created for each region in the brain to identify a positive derivative, that is, a part of life with an increase in cortical thickness. Likewise, the color bands were used to identify a negative derivative, that is, a lifetime period with a cortical thickness reduction. Regions of the brain with similar derivatives were organized and displayed in clusters. Computer simulations showed that some regions exhibit abrupt changes in cortical thickness at specific periods of life. The simulations also illustrated that some regions in the left hemisphere do not follow the pattern of the same region in the right hemisphere. Finally, it was concluded that each region in the brain must be dynamically modeled. One advantage of using artificial neural networks is that they can learn and model non-linear and complex relationships. Also, artificial neural networks are immune to noise in the samples and can handle unseen data. That is, the models based on artificial neural networks can predict the behavior of samples that were not used for training. Furthermore, several studies have shown that artificial neural networks are capable of deriving information from imprecise data. Because of these advantages, the results obtained in this study by the artificial neural networks provide valuable information to analyze and model the cortical thickness.", "Oral appliance therapy is not commonly used to treat obstructive sleep apnea due to inconsistent efficacy and lack of established configuration procedures. Both problems may be overcome by information gathered while repositioning the mandible during sleep. The purpose of this investigation was to determine if an unattended sleep study with a mandibular positioner can predict therapeutic success and efficacious mandibular position, assess the contribution of artificial intelligence analytics to such a system, and evaluate symptom resolution using an objective titration approach.\nFifty-eight individuals with obstructive sleep apnea underwent an unattended sleep study with an auto-adjusting mandibular positioner followed by fitting of a custom oral appliance. Therapeutic outcome was assessed by the 4% oxygen desaturation index with therapeutic success defined as oxygen desaturation index < 10 h-1. Outcome was prospectively predicted by an artificial intelligence system and a heuristic, rule-based method. An efficacious mandibular position was also prospectively predicted by the test. Data on obstructive sleep apnea symptom resolution were collected 6 months following initiation of oral appliance therapy.\nThe artificial intelligence method had significantly higher predictive accuracy (sensitivity: 0.91, specificity: 1.00) than the heuristic method (P = .016). The predicted efficacious mandibular position was associated with therapeutic success in 83% of responders. Appliances titrated based on oxygen desaturation index effectively resolved obstructive sleep apnea symptoms.\nThe MATRx plus device provides an accurate means for predicting outcome to oral appliance therapy in the home environment and offers a replacement to blind titration of oral appliances.\nRegistry: ClinicalTrials.gov; Name: Predictive Accuracy of MATRx plus in Identifying Favorable Candidates for Oral Appliance Therapy; Identifier: NCT03217383; URL: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03217383.\nMosca EV, Bruehlmann S, Zouboules SM, et\u00a0al. In-home mandibular repositioning during sleep using MATRx plus predicts outcome and efficacious positioning for oral appliance treatment of obstructive sleep apnea.

Therefore, strengthening the mental health education of students has become an urgent need of society and a hot issue of common concern. In order to solve the problems of high misjudgment rate and low work efficiency in the current mental health intelligence evaluation process, a mental health intelligence evaluation system based on a joint optimization algorithm is proposed. The joint optimization algorithm consists of an improved decision tree algorithm and an improved ANN algorithm. First, analyze the current research status of mental health intelligence evaluation, and construct the framework of mental health intelligence evaluation system; then collect mental health intelligence evaluation data based on data mining, use joint learning algorithm to analyze and classify mental health intelligence evaluation data, and obtain mental health intelligence evaluation results. Finally, through specific simulation experiments, the feasibility and superiority of the mental health intelligent evaluation system are analyzed. The results show that the system in the article overcomes the shortcomings of the existing mental health intelligence evaluation system, improves the accuracy of mental health intelligence evaluation, and improves the efficiency of mental health intelligence evaluation. It has good system stability and can meet the actual current situation, which are requirements for mental health intelligence evaluation.", "To have population-level impact, physical activity (PA) interventions must be effectively implemented and sustained under real-world conditions. Adequate Fundamental Movement Skills (FMS) is integral to children being able to actively participate in play, games, and sports. Yet, few FMS interventions have been implemented at scale, nor sustained in routine practice, and thus it is important to understand the influences on sustained implementation. The study's aim was to use Collective Intelligence (CI)-an applied systems science approach-with stakeholder groups to understand barriers to the implementation of FMS interventions, interdependencies between these barriers, and options to overcome the system of barriers identified.\nThree CI sessions were conducted with three separate groups of experienced FMS intervention researchers/practitioners (N\u2009=\u200922) in the United Kingdom and Ireland. Participants generated and ranked barriers they perceive most critical in implementing FMS interventions. Each group developed a structural model describing how highly ranked barriers are interrelated in a system. Participants then conducted action mapping to solve the problem based on the logical relations between barriers reflected in the model.\nThe top ranked barriers (of 76) are those related to policy, physical education curriculum, and stakeholders' knowledge and appreciation. As reflected in the structural model, these barriers have influences over stakeholders' efficacy in delivering and evaluating interventions. According to this logical structure, 38 solutions were created as a roadmap to inform policy, practice, and research. Collectively, solutions suggest that efforts in implementation and sustainability need to be coordinated (i.e., building interrelationship with multiple stakeholders), and a policy or local infrastructure that supports these efforts is needed.\nThe current study is the first to describe the complexity of barriers to implementing and sustaining FMS interventions and provide a roadmap of actions that help navigate through the complexity. By directing attention to the ecological context of FMS intervention research and participation, the study provides researchers, policy makers, and practitioners with a framework of critical components and players that need to be considered when designing and operationalising future projects in more systemic and relational terms.", "Computer-aided diagnosis with artificial intelligence (AI) has been used clinically, and ground truth generalizability is important for AI performance in medical image analyses. The AI model was trained on one specific group of older adults (aged\u226760) has not yet been shown to work equally well in a younger adult group (aged 18-59).\nTo compare the performance of the developed AI model with ensemble method trained with the ground truth for those aged 60 years or older in identifying vertebral fractures (VFs) on plain lateral radiographs of spine (PLRS) between younger and older adult populations.\nRetrospective analysis of PLRS in a single medical institution.\nAccuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and interobserver reliability (kappa value) were used to compare diagnostic performance of the AI model and subspecialists' consensus between the two groups.\nBetween January 2016 and December 2018, the ground truth of 941 patients (one PLRS per person) aged 60 years and older with 1101 VFs and 6358 normal vertebrae was used to set up the AI model. The framework of the developed AI model includes: object detection with You Only Look Once Version 3 (YOLOv3) at T0-L5 levels in the PLRS, data pre-preprocessing with image-size and quality processing, and AI ensemble model (ResNet34, DenseNet121, and DenseNet201) for identifying or grading VFs. The reported overall accuracy, sensitivity and specificity were 92%, 91% and 93%, respectively, and external validation was also performed. Thereafter, patients diagnosed as VFs and treated in our institution during October 2019 to August 2020 were the study group regardless of age. In total, 258 patients (339 VFs and 1725 normal vertebrae) in the older adult population (mean age 78\u00b110.4; range, 60-106) were enrolled. In the younger adult population (mean age 36\u00b19.43; range, 20-49), 106 patients (120 VFs and 728 normal vertebrae) were enrolled. After identification and grading of VFs based on the Genant method with consensus between two subspecialists', VFs in each PLRS with human labels were defined as the testing dataset. The corresponding CT or MRI scan was used for labeling in the PLRS. The bootstrap method was applied to the testing dataset.\nThe model for clinical application, Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) format, is uploaded directly (available at: http://140.113.114.104/vght_demo/svf-model (grading) and http://140.113.114.104/vght demo/svf-model2 (labeling). Overall accuracy, sensitivity and specificity in the older adult population were 93.36% (95% CI 93.34%-93.38%), 88.97% (95% CI 88.59%-88.99%) and 94.26% (95% CI 94.23%-94.29%), respectively. Overall accuracy, sensitivity and specificity in the younger adult population were 93.75% (95% CI 93.7%-93.8%), 65.00% (95% CI 64.33%-65.67%) and 98.49% (95% CI 98.45%-98.52%), respectively. Accuracy reached 100% in VFs grading once the VFs were labeled accurately. The unique pattern of limbus-like VFs, 43 (35.8%) were investigated only in the younger adult population. If limbus-like VFs from the dataset were not included, the accuracy increased from 93.75% (95% CI 93.70%-93.80%) to 95.78% (95% CI 95.73%-95.82%), sensitivity increased from 65.00% (95% CI 64.33%-65.67%) to 70.13% (95% CI 68.98%-71.27%) and specificity remained unchanged at 98.49% (95% CI 98.45%-98.52%), respectively. The main causes of false negative results in older adults were patients' lung markings, diaphragm or bowel airs (37%, n=14) followed by type I fracture (29%, n=11). The main causes of false negatives in younger adults were limbus-like VFs (45%, n=19), followed by type I fracture (26%, n=11). The overall kappa between AI discrimination and subspecialists' consensus in the older and younger adult populations were 0.77 (95% CI, 0.733-0.805) and 0.72 (95% CI, 0.6524-0.80), respectively.\nThe developed VF-identifying AI ensemble model based on ground truth of older adults achieved better performance in identifying VFs in older adults and non-fractured thoracic and lumbar vertebrae in the younger adults. Different age distribution may have potential disease diversity and implicate the effect of ground truth generalizability on the AI model performance.", "Mentalizing, the ability to infer the mental states of others, is a cornerstone of adaptive social intelligence. While functional brain mapping of human mentalizing has progressed considerably, its evolutionary signature in nonhuman primates remains debated. The discovery that the middle part of the macaque superior temporal sulcus (mid-STS) region has a connectional fingerprint most similar to the human temporoparietal junction (TPJ)-a crucial node in the mentalizing network-raises the possibility that these cortical areas may also share basic functional properties associated with mentalizing. Here, we show that this is the case in aspects of a preference for live social interactions and in a theoretical framework of predictive coding. Macaque monkeys were trained to perform a turn-taking choice task with another real monkey partner sitting directly face-to-face or a filmed partner appearing in prerecorded videos. We found that about three-fourths of task-related mid-STS neurons exhibited agent-dependent activity, most responding selectively or preferentially to the partner's action. At the population level, activities of these partner-type neurons were significantly greater under live-partner compared to video-recorded-partner task conditions. Furthermore, a subset of the partner-type neurons responded proactively when predictions about the partner's action were violated. This prediction error coding was specific to the action domain; almost none of the neurons signaled error in the prediction of reward. The present findings highlight unique roles of the macaque mid-STS at the single-neuron level and further delineate its functional parallels with the human TPJ in social cognitive processes associated with mentalizing.", "Colorectal cancer (CRC) was the second-ranked worldwide type of cancer during 2020 due to the crude mortality rate of 12.0 per 100000 inhabitants. It can be prevented if glandular tissue (adenomatous polyps) is detected early. Colonoscopy has been strongly recommended as a screening test for both early cancer and adenomatous polyps. However, it has some limitations that include the high polyp miss rate for smaller (< 10 mm) or flat polyps, which are easily missed during visual inspection. Due to the rapid advancement of technology, artificial intelligence (AI) has been a thriving area in different fields, including medicine. Particularly, in gastroenterology AI software has been included in computer-aided systems for diagnosis and to improve the assertiveness of automatic polyp detection and its classification as a preventive method for CRC. This article provides an overview of recent research focusing on AI tools and their applications in the early detection of CRC and adenomatous polyps, as well as an insightful analysis of the main advantages and misconceptions in the field.", "We develop a new family of variance reduced stochastic gradient descent methods for minimizing the average of a very large number of smooth functions. Our method-JacSketch-is motivated by novel developments in randomized numerical linear algebra, and operates by maintaining a stochastic estimate of a Jacobian matrix composed of the gradients of individual functions. In each iteration, JacSketch efficiently updates the Jacobian matrix by first obtaining a random linear measurement of the true Jacobian through (cheap) sketching, and then projecting the previous estimate onto the solution space of a linear matrix equation whose solutions are consistent with the measurement. The Jacobian estimate is then used to compute a variance-reduced unbiased estimator of the gradient. Our strategy is analogous to the way quasi-Newton methods maintain an estimate of the Hessian, and hence our method can be seen as a stochastic quasi-gradient method. Our method can also be seen as stochastic gradient descent applied to a controlled stochastic optimization reformulation of the original problem, where the control comes from the Jacobian estimates. We prove that for smooth and strongly convex functions, JacSketch converges linearly with a meaningful rate dictated by a single convergence theorem which applies to general sketches. We also provide a refined convergence theorem which applies to a smaller class of sketches, featuring a novel proof technique based on a stochastic Lyapunov function. This enables us to obtain sharper complexity results for variants of JacSketch with importance sampling. By specializing our general approach to specific sketching strategies, JacSketch reduces to the celebrated stochastic average gradient (SAGA) method, and its several existing and many new minibatch, reduced memory, and importance sampling variants. Our rate for SAGA with importance sampling is the current best-known rate for this method, resolving a conjecture by Schmidt\u00a0et\u00a0al. (Proceedings of the eighteenth international conference on artificial intelligence and statistics, AISTATS 2015, San Diego, California, 2015). The rates we obtain for minibatch SAGA are also superior to existing rates and are sufficiently tight as to show a decrease in total complexity as the minibatch size increases. Moreover, we obtain the first minibatch SAGA method with importance sampling.", "Integrating disruptive technologies within smart cities improves the infrastructure needed to potentially deal with disasters. This paper provides a perspective review of disruptive technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), image processing, artificial intelligence (AI), big data and smartphone applications which are in use and have been proposed for future improvements in disaster management of urban regions. The key focus of this paper is exploring ways in which smart cities could be established to harness the potential of disruptive technologies and improve post-disaster management. The key questions explored are a) what are the gaps or barriers to the utilization of disruptive technologies in the area of disaster management and b) How can the existing methods of disaster management be improved through the application of disruptive technologies. To respond to these questions, a novel framework based on integrated approaches based on big data analytics and AI is proposed for developing disaster management solutions using disruptive technologies.", "Social interaction is thought to provide a selection pressure for human intelligence, yet little is known about its neurobiological basis and evolution throughout the primate lineage. Recent advances in neuroimaging have enabled whole brain investigation of brain structure, function, and connectivity in humans and non-human primates (NHPs), leading to a nascent field of comparative connectomics. However, linking social behavior to brain organization across the primates remains challenging. Here, we review the current understanding of the macroscale neural mechanisms of social behaviors from the viewpoint of system neuroscience. We first demonstrate an association between the number of cortical neurons and the size of social groups across primates, suggesting a link between neural information-processing capacity and social capabilities. Moreover, by capitalizing on recent advances in species-harmonized functional MRI, we demonstrate that portions of the mirror neuron system and default-mode networks, which are thought to be important for representation of the other's actions and sense of self, respectively, exhibit similarities in functional organization in macaque monkeys and humans, suggesting possible homologies. With respect to these two networks, we describe recent developments in the neurobiology of social perception, joint attention, personality and social complexity. Together, the Human Connectome Project (HCP)-style comparative neuroimaging, hyperscanning, behavioral, and other multi-modal investigations are expected to yield important insights into the evolutionary foundations of human social behavior.", "To analyze the evaluation of artificial intelligence algorithm combined with gastric computed tomography (CT) image in clinical chemotherapy for advanced gastric cancer, 112 patients with advanced gastric cancer were selected as the research object. Among which, 56 patients in the experimental group received paclitaxel (PTX) combined with decitabine sequential decitabine maintenance therapy. Fifty-six patients in the control group received first-line treatment with decitabine combined with cisplatin. The image segmentation algorithm based on fast interactive dictionary selection was used to process gastric CT images. Complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD), progressive disease (PD), response rate (RR), disease control rate (DCR), and overall survival (OS) after treatment were recorded. The true-positive rate (TPR) and coincidence ratio (CR) of the proposed algorithm for image segmentation were significantly higher than those of the mean shift algorithm and the iCoseg algorithm. The mean edge distance (MED) and edge distance variance (EDV) were significantly lower than the mean shift algorithm and the iCoseg algorithm, and the differences were considerable (P < 0.05). The number of CR (5 cases), PR (13 cases), RR (18 cases), and DCR (44 cases) in the experimental group was significantly higher than that in the control group, while the number of PD (12 cases) was significantly lower than that in the control group (P < 0.05). The number of patients complicated with hematological toxicity, leucopenia, thrombocytopenia, and digestive tract reaction in the experimental group was less than that in the control group (P < 0.05). From the comparison of long-term efficacy, the survival rate of patients in both groups showed a decreasing trend within 24 months, but the decreasing trend of survival rate of patients in the experimental group was better than that in the control group. In short, the proposed algorithm had better segmentation performance than traditional algorithms. Compared with first-line treatment with decitabine and cisplatin, PTX in combination with decitabine sequential citabine maintenance regimens had better disease control rates, lower toxicity, and more effective improvements in patient quality of life and longer survival in patients with advanced gastric cancer.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) tools find increasing application in drug discovery supporting every stage of the Design-Make-Test-Analyse (DMTA) cycle. The main focus of this chapter is the application in molecular generation with the aid of deep neural networks (DNN). We present a historical overview of the main advances in the field. We analyze the concepts of distribution and goal-directed learning and then highlight some of the recent applications of generative models in drug design with a focus into research work from the biopharmaceutical industry. We present in some more detail REINVENT which is an open-source software developed within our group in AstraZeneca and the main platform for AI molecular design support for a number of medicinal chemistry projects in the company and we also demonstrate some of our work in library design. Finally, we present some of the main challenges in the application of AI in Drug Discovery and different approaches to respond to these challenges which define areas for current and future work.", "Machine learning (ML), a form of artificial intelligence (AI), is being increasingly employed in neurology. Reported performance metrics often match or exceed the efficiency of average clinicians. The neurologist is easily baffled by the underlying concepts and terminologies associated with ML studies. The superlative performance metrics of ML algorithms often hide the opaque nature of its inner workings. Questions regarding ML model's interpretability and reproducibility of its results in real-world scenarios, need emphasis. Given an abundance of time and information, the expert clinician should be able to deliver comparable predictions to ML models, a useful benchmark while evaluating its performance. Predictive performance metrics of ML models should not be confused with causal inference between its input and output. ML and clinical gestalt should compete in a randomized controlled trial before they can complement each other for screening, triaging, providing second opinions and modifying treatment.", "In the last decade, there has been a rapid increase in research on the use of artificial intelligence (AI) to improve child and youth participation in daily life activities, which is a key rehabilitation outcome. However, existing reviews place variable focus on participation, are narrow in scope, and are restricted to select diagnoses, hindering interpretability regarding the existing scope of AI applications that target the participation of children and youth in a pediatric rehabilitation setting.\nThe aim of this scoping review is to examine how AI is integrated into pediatric rehabilitation interventions targeting the participation of children and youth with disabilities or other diagnosed health conditions in valued activities.\nWe conducted a comprehensive literature search using established Applied Health Sciences and Computer Science databases. Two independent researchers screened and selected the studies based on a systematic procedure. Inclusion criteria were as follows: participation was an explicit study aim or outcome or the targeted focus of the AI application; AI was applied as part of the provided and tested intervention; children or youth with a disability or other diagnosed health conditions were the focus of either the study or AI application or both; and the study was published in English. Data were mapped according to the types of AI, the mode of delivery, the type of personalization, and whether the intervention addressed individual goal-setting.\nThe literature search identified 3029 documents, of which 94 met the inclusion criteria. Most of the included studies used multiple applications of AI with the highest prevalence of robotics (72/94, 77%) and human-machine interaction (51/94, 54%). Regarding mode of delivery, most of the included studies described an intervention delivered in-person (84/94, 89%), and only 11% (10/94) were delivered remotely. Most interventions were tailored to groups of individuals (93/94, 99%). Only 1% (1/94) of interventions was tailored to patients' individually reported participation needs, and only one intervention (1/94, 1%) described individual goal-setting as part of their therapy process or intervention planning.\nThere is an increasing amount of research on interventions using AI to target the participation of children and youth with disabilities or other diagnosed health conditions, supporting the potential of using AI in pediatric rehabilitation. On the basis of our results, 3 major gaps for further research and development were identified: a lack of remotely delivered participation-focused interventions using AI; a lack of individual goal-setting integrated in interventions; and a lack of interventions tailored to individually reported participation needs of children, youth, or families.", "Machine-assisted pathological recognition has been focused on supervised learning (SL) that suffers from a significant annotation bottleneck. We propose a semi-supervised learning (SSL) method based on the mean teacher architecture using 13,111 whole slide images of colorectal cancer from 8803 subjects from 13 independent centers. SSL (~3150 labeled, ~40,950 unlabeled; ~6300 labeled, ~37,800 unlabeled patches) performs significantly better than the SL. No significant difference is found between SSL (~6300 labeled, ~37,800 unlabeled) and SL (~44,100 labeled) at patch-level diagnoses (area under the curve (AUC): 0.980\u2009\u00b1\u20090.014 vs. 0.987\u2009\u00b1\u20090.008, P value = 0.134) and patient-level diagnoses (AUC: 0.974\u2009\u00b1\u20090.013 vs. 0.980\u2009\u00b1\u20090.010, P value = 0.117), which is close to human pathologists (average AUC: 0.969). The evaluation on 15,000 lung and 294,912 lymph node images also confirm SSL can achieve similar performance as that of SL with massive annotations. SSL dramatically reduces the annotations, which has great potential to effectively build expert-level pathological artificial intelligence platforms in practice.", "With commercialization of deep learning (DL) models, daily precision dietary record based on images from smartphones becomes possible. This study took advantage of DL techniques on visual recognition tasks and proposed a suite of big-data-driven DL models regressing from food images to their nutrient estimation. We established and publicized the first food image database from the Chinese market, named ChinaMartFood-109. It contained 10,921 images with 23 nutrient contents, covering 18 main food groups. Inception V3 was optimized using other state-of-the-art deep convolutional neural networks, achieving up to 78 % and 94 % for top-1 and top-5 accuracy, respectively. Besides, this research compared three nutrient estimation algorithms and achieved the best regression coefficient (R2) by normalization\u00a0+\u00a0AM compared with arithmetic mean and harmonic mean, validating applicability in practice as well as theory. These encouraging results provide further evidence supporting artificial intelligence in the field of food analysis.", "To assess the performance of artificial intelligence in the automated classification of images taken with a tablet device of patients with blepharoptosis and subjects with normal eyelid.\nThis is a prospective and observational study. A total of 1276 eyelid images (624 images from 347 blepharoptosis cases and 652 images from 367 normal controls) from 606 participants were analyzed. In order to obtain a sufficient number of images for analysis, 1 to 4 eyelid images were obtained from each participant. We developed a model by fully retraining the pre-trained MobileNetV2 convolutional neural network. Subsequently, we verified whether the automatic diagnosis of blepharoptosis was possible using the images. In addition, we visualized how the model captured the features of the test data with Score-CAM. k-fold cross-validation (k\u2009=\u20095) was adopted for splitting the training and validation. Sensitivity, specificity, and the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic curve for detecting blepharoptosis were examined.\nWe found the model had a sensitivity of 83.0% (95% confidence interval [CI], 79.8-85.9) and a specificity of 82.5% (95% CI, 79.4-85.4). The accuracy of the validation data was 82.8%, and the AUC was 0.900 (95% CI, 0.882-0.917).\nArtificial intelligence was able to classify with high accuracy images of blepharoptosis and normal eyelids taken using a tablet device. Thus, the diagnosis of blepharoptosis with a tablet device is possible at a high level of accuracy.\nDate of registration: 2021-06-25.\nUMIN000044660.

Computational drug discovery contributes to ligand discovery and optimization, by using models that describe the properties of ligands and their interactions with biological targets. In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has made remarkable modeling progress, driven by new algorithms and by the increase in computing power and storage capacities, which allow the processing of large amounts of data in a short time. This review provides the current state of the art of AI methods applied to drug discovery, with a focus on structure- and ligand-based virtual screening, library design and high-throughput analysis, drug repurposing and drug sensitivity, de novo design, chemical reactions and synthetic accessibility, ADMET, and quantum mechanics.", "The development of multiple intelligences used to focus on kindergartens and elementary schools as educational experts and officials considered that the development of students' multiple intelligences should be cultivated from childhood and slowly promoted to other levels. Nevertheless, the framework of multiple intelligences should not be simply promoted in kindergartens and elementary schools, but was also suitable in high schools, universities, and even graduate schools or in-service training. Taking employees in Southern Taiwan Science Park as the research subjects, total 314 employees in high-tech industry are preceded the 16-week (3 h per week for total 48 h) experimental teaching research. The research results show that (1) teaching with multiple intelligences would affect learning motivation, (2) teaching with multiple intelligences would affect learning achievement, and (3) learning motivation reveals remarkably positive effects on learning achievement.

However, it is often difficult to distinguish between these entities. In the present study, we aimed to classify the most powerful markers that could improve diagnosis by multiparametric flow cytometry (MFC). The present study included 348 patients based on two independent cohorts. We first assessed how representative the data were in the discovery cohort (123 MM, 97 MGUS) and then analysed their respective plasma cell (PC) phenotype in order to obtain a set of correlations with a hypersphere visualisation. Cluster of differentiation (CD)27 and CD38 were differentially expressed in MGUS and MM (P\u2009<\u20090\u00b7001). We found by a gradient boosting machine method that the percentage of abnormal PCs and the ratio PC/CD117 positive precursors were the most influential parameters at diagnosis to distinguish MGUS and MM. Finally, we designed a decisional algorithm allowing a predictive classification \u226595% when PC dyscrasias were suspected, without any misclassification between MGUS and SMM. We validated this algorithm in an independent cohort of PC dyscrasias (n\u2009=\u200987 MM, n\u2009=\u200941 MGUS). This artificial intelligence model is freely available online as a diagnostic tool application website for all MFC centers worldwide (https://aihematology.shinyapps.io/PCdyscrasiasToolDg/).", "The field of artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly advancing, and AI models are increasingly applied in the medical field, especially in medical imaging, pathology, natural language processing, and biosignal analysis. On the basis of these advances, telemedicine, which allows people to receive medical services outside of hospitals or clinics, is also developing in many countries. The mechanisms of deep learning used in medical AI include convolutional neural networks, residual neural networks, and generative adversarial networks.

The opportunity for the application of AI/ML based approaches in the pharmaceutical industry is driven by the abundance of data sets that exist within individual pharmaceutical and biotech companies and the availability, within these environments, of abundant computing power. This chapter seeks to describe opportunities for artificial intelligence to contribute to the assessment and evaluation of the dug metabolism and pharmacokinetic (DMPK) properties of novel compounds across the drug discovery and development continuum. Many initiatives are already underway with respect to the application of AI/ML in predicting pharmacokinetic profiles so the question is not whether AI will influence pharmacokinetic prediction but rather how to best utilize and incorporate this and how to evaluate the value added from these applications. Since our understanding of the underlying biology of the in vitro and in vivo systems with respect to ADME, one of the key challenges to AI-based methods will be the ability to adapt to data sets that change in quality over time.", "The COVID-19 pandemic has challenged institutions' diagnostic processes worldwide. The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility of an artificial intelligence (AI)-based software tool that automatically evaluates chest computed tomography for findings of suspected COVID-19.Two groups were retrospectively evaluated for COVID-19-associated ground glass opacities of the lungs (group A: real-time polymerase chain reaction positive COVID patients, n\u200a=\u200a108; group B: asymptomatic pre-operative group, n\u200a=\u200a88). The performance of an AI-based software assessment tool for detection of COVID-associated abnormalities was compared with human evaluation based on COVID-19 reporting and data system (CO-RADS) scores performed by 3 readers.All evaluated variables of the AI-based assessment showed significant differences between the 2 groups (P\u200a<\u200a.01). The inter-reader reliability of CO-RADS scoring was 0.87. The CO-RADS scores were substantially higher in group A (mean 4.28) than group B (mean 1.50). The difference between CO-RADS scoring and AI assessment was statistically significant for all variables but showed good correlation with the clinical context of the CO-RADS score. AI allowed to predict COVID positive cases with an accuracy of 0.94.The evaluated AI-based algorithm detects COVID-19-associated findings with high sensitivity and may support radiologic workflows during the pandemic.", "Lignocellulosic biomass (LCB) is considered as a sustainable feedstock for a biorefinery to generate biofuels and other bio-chemicals. However, commercialization is one of the challenges that limits cost-effective operation of conventional LCB biorefinery. This article highlights some studies on the sustainability of LCB in terms of cost-competitiveness and environmental impact reduction. In addition, the development of computational intelligence methods such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) as a tool to aid the improvement of LCB biorefinery in terms of optimization, prediction, classification, and decision support systems. Lastly, this review examines the possible research gaps on the production and valorization in a smart sustainable biorefinery towards circular economy.", "Artificial intelligence (AI)-driven symptom checkers are available to millions of users globally and are advocated as a tool to deliver health care more efficiently. To achieve the promoted benefits of a symptom checker, laypeople must trust and subsequently follow its instructions. In AI, explanations are seen as a tool to communicate the rationale behind black-box decisions to encourage trust and adoption. However, the effectiveness of the types of explanations used in AI-driven symptom checkers has not yet been studied. Explanations can follow many forms, including why-explanations and how-explanations. Social theories suggest that why-explanations are better at communicating knowledge and cultivating trust among laypeople.\nThe aim of this study is to ascertain whether explanations provided by a symptom checker affect explanatory trust among laypeople and whether this trust is impacted by their existing knowledge of disease.\nA cross-sectional survey of 750 healthy participants was conducted. The participants were shown a video of a chatbot simulation that resulted in the diagnosis of either a migraine or temporal arteritis, chosen for their differing levels of epidemiological prevalence. These diagnoses were accompanied by one of four types of explanations. Each explanation type was selected either because of its current use in symptom checkers or because it was informed by theories of contrastive explanation. Exploratory factor analysis of participants' responses followed by comparison-of-means tests were used to evaluate group differences in trust.\nDepending on the treatment group, two or three variables were generated, reflecting the prior knowledge and subsequent mental model that the participants held. When varying explanation type by disease, migraine was found to be nonsignificant (P=.65) and temporal arteritis, marginally significant (P=.09). Varying disease by explanation type resulted in statistical significance for input influence (P=.001), social proof (P=.049), and no explanation (P=.006), with counterfactual explanation (P=.053). The results suggest that trust in explanations is significantly affected by the disease being explained. When laypeople have existing knowledge of a disease, explanations have little impact on trust. Where the need for information is greater, different explanation types engender significantly different levels of trust. These results indicate that to be successful, symptom checkers need to tailor explanations to each user's specific question and discount the diseases that they may also be aware of.\nSystem builders developing explanations for symptom-checking apps should consider the recipient's knowledge of a disease and tailor explanations to each user's specific need. Effort should be placed on generating explanations that are personalized to each user of a symptom checker to fully discount the diseases that they may be aware of and to close their information gap.", "Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) are two subclasses of Artificial Intelligence (AI), that, in this day and age of big data provides significant opportunities to pharmaceutical discovery research and development by translating data to information and ultimately to knowledge.

This chapter would provide an overview of these methods and how they have been applied across various work streams, e.g., generative chemistry, ADMET prediction, retrosynthetic analysis, etc. within drug discovery process. This chapter would also attempt to provide caution and pit falls in utilizing these methods blindly while summarizing challenges and limitations.", "Drug-induced prolongation of the QT interval is common in a variety of pharmaceutical treatments and can lead to serious clinical outcomes. Although substantial efforts have been made to prevent drug-induced QT interval prolongation, the lack of a centralized data source remains the main obstacle to further study of the underlying mechanism and the development of effective prediction strategies. To fill this gap, we propose a schema for stratifying the risk of marketed QT prolonging drugs based on US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drug labeling and developed a Drug-Induced QT Prolongation Atlas (DIQTA). Potential application of DIQTA was shown by precision dosing in off-label use and therapeutic strategy optimization, as well as the facilitation of artificial intelligence (AI)-based modeling in predictive toxicity.", "In the era of data-driven medicine, rapid access and accurate interpretation of medical images are becoming increasingly important. The DICOM Image ANalysis and Archive (DIANA) system is an open-source, lightweight, and scalable Python interface that enables users to interact with hospital Picture Archiving and Communications Systems (PACS) to access such data. In this work, DIANA functionality was detailed and evaluated in the context of retrospective PACS data retrieval and two prospective clinical artificial intelligence (AI) pipelines: bone age (BA) estimation and intra-cranial hemorrhage (ICH) detection. DIANA orchestrates activity beginning with post-acquisition study discovery and ending with online notifications of findings. For AI applications, system latency (exam completion to system report time) was quantified and compared to that of clinicians (exam completion to initial report creation time). Mean DIANA latency was 9.04\u2009\u00b1\u20093.83 and 20.17\u2009\u00b1\u200910.16\u00a0min compared to clinician latency of 51.52\u2009\u00b1\u200958.9 and 65.62\u2009\u00b1\u2009110.39\u00a0min for BA and ICH, respectively, with DIANA latencies being significantly lower (p\u2009<\u20090.001). DIANA's capabilities were also explored and found effective in retrieving and anonymizing protected health information for \"big-data\" medical imaging research and analysis. Mean per-image retrieval times were 1.12\u2009\u00b1\u20090.50 and 0.08\u2009\u00b1\u20090.01\u00a0s across x-ray and computed tomography studies, respectively. The data herein demonstrate that DIANA can flexibly integrate into existing hospital infrastructure and improve the process by which researchers/clinicians access imaging repository data. This results in a simplified workflow for large data retrieval and clinical integration of AI models.", "Accurate diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) followed by effective rehabilitation is essential for the management of this disorder. Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques can aid physicians to apply automatic diagnosis and rehabilitation procedures. AI techniques comprise traditional machine learning (ML) approaches and deep learning (DL) techniques. Conventional ML methods employ various feature extraction and classification techniques, but in DL, the process of feature extraction and classification is accomplished intelligently and integrally. DL methods for diagnosis of ASD have been focused on neuroimaging-based approaches. Neuroimaging techniques are non-invasive disease markers potentially useful for ASD diagnosis. Structural and functional neuroimaging techniques provide physicians substantial information about the structure (anatomy and structural connectivity) and function (activity and functional connectivity) of the brain. Due to the intricate structure and function of the brain, proposing optimum procedures for ASD diagnosis with neuroimaging data without exploiting powerful AI techniques like DL may be challenging. In this paper, studies conducted with the aid of DL networks to distinguish ASD are investigated. Rehabilitation tools provided for supporting ASD patients utilizing DL networks are also assessed. Finally, we will present important challenges in the automated detection and rehabilitation of ASD and propose some future works.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) comprises a wide range of technologies and methods with heterogeneous degrees of complexity, applications, and abilities. In the cardiovascular field, AI holds the potential to fulfil many unsolved challenges, eventually translating into improved patient care. In particular, AI appears as the most promising tool to overcome the gap between ever-increasing data-rich technologies and their practical implementation in cardiovascular research, in the cardiologist routine, in the patient daily life and at the healthcare-policy level. A multiplicity of AI technologies is progressively pervading several aspects of precision cardiovascular medicine including early diagnosis, automated imaging processing and interpretation, disease sub-phenotyping, risk prediction and remote monitoring systems. Several methodological, logistical, educational, and ethical challenges are emerging by integrating AI systems at any stage of cardiovascular medicine. This review will discuss the basics of AI methods, the growing body of evidence supporting the role of AI in the cardiovascular field and the challenges to overcome for an effective AI-integrated cardiovascular medicine.", "This work deals with Natural Language Processing applied to Electronic Health Records (EHRs). EHRs are coded following the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) leading to a multi-label classification problem. Previously proposed approaches act as black-boxes without giving further insights. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) helps to clarify what brought the model to make the predictions.\nThis work aims to obtain explainable predictions of the diseases and procedures contained in EHRs. As an application, we show visualizations of the attention stored and propose a prototype of a Decision Support System (DSS) that highlights the text that motivated the choice of each of the proposed ICD codes.\nConvolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with attention mechanisms were used. Attention mechanisms allow to detect which part of the input (EHRs) motivate the output (medical codes), producing explainable predictions.\nWe successfully applied methods in a Spanish corpus getting challenging results. Finally, we presented the idea of extracting the chronological order of the ICDs in a given EHR by anchoring the codes to different stages of the clinical admission.\nWe found that explainable deep learning models applied to predict medical codes store helpful information that could be used to assist medical experts while reaching a solid performance. In particular, we show that the information stored in the attention mechanisms enables DSS and a shallow chronology of diagnoses.", "The intersection between neuroscience and artificial intelligence (AI) research has created synergistic effects in both fields. While neuroscientific discoveries have inspired the development of AI architectures, new ideas and algorithms from AI research have produced new ways to study brain mechanisms. A well-known example is the case of reinforcement learning (RL), which has stimulated neuroscience research on how animals learn to adjust their behavior to maximize reward. In this review article, we cover recent collaborative work between the two fields in the context of meta-learning and its extension to social cognition and consciousness. Meta-learning refers to the ability to learn how to learn, such as learning to adjust hyperparameters of existing learning algorithms and how to use existing models and knowledge to efficiently solve new tasks. This meta-learning capability is important for making existing AI systems more adaptive and flexible to efficiently solve new tasks. Since this is one of the areas where there is a gap between human performance and current AI systems, successful collaboration should produce new ideas and progress. Starting from the role of RL algorithms in driving neuroscience, we discuss recent developments in deep RL applied to modeling prefrontal cortex functions. Even from a broader perspective, we discuss the similarities and differences between social cognition and meta-learning, and finally conclude with speculations on the potential links between intelligence as endowed by model-based RL and consciousness. For future work we highlight data efficiency, autonomy and intrinsic motivation as key research areas for advancing both fields.", "The advancements of artificial intelligence (AI) for osteoarthritis (OA) applications have been rapid in recent years, particularly innovations of deep learning for image classification, lesion detection, cartilage segmentation, and prediction modeling of future knee OA development. This review article focuses on AI applications in OA research, first describing machine learning (ML) techniques and workflow, followed by how these algorithms are used for OA classification tasks through imaging and non-imaging-based ML models. Deep learning applications for OA research, including analysis of both radiographs for automatic detection of OA severity, and MR images for detection of cartilage/meniscus lesions and cartilage segmentation for automatic T2 quantification will be described. In addition, information on ML models that identify individuals at high risk of OA development will be provided. The future vision of machine learning applications in imaging of OA and cartilage hinges on implementation of AI for optimizing imaging protocols, quantitative assessment of cartilage, and automated analysis of disease burden yielding a faster and more efficient workflow for a radiologist with a higher level of reproducibility and precision. It may also provide risk assessment tools for individual patients, which is an integral part of precision medicine.", "Introduction: Electrocardiography (ECG) is a quick and easily accessible method for diagnosis and screening of cardiovascular diseases including heart failure (HF). Artificial intelligence (AI) can be used for semi-automated ECG analysis. The aim of this evaluation was to provide an overview of AI use in HF detection from ECG signals and to perform a meta-analysis of available studies. Methods and Results: An independent comprehensive search of the PubMed and Google Scholar database was conducted for articles dealing with the ability of AI to predict HF based on ECG signals. Only original articles published in peer-reviewed journals were considered. A total of five reports including 57,027 patients and 579,134 ECG datasets were identified including two sets of patient-level data and three with ECG-based datasets. The AI-processed ECG data yielded areas under the receiver operator characteristics curves between 0.92 and 0.99 to identify HF with higher values in ECG-based datasets. Applying a random-effects model, an sROC of 0.987 was calculated. Using the contingency tables led to diagnostic odds ratios ranging from 3.44 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 3.12-3.76] to 13.61 (95% CI = 13.14-14.08) also with lower values in patient-level datasets. The meta-analysis diagnostic odds ratio was 7.59 (95% CI = 5.85-9.34). Conclusions: The present meta-analysis confirms the ability of AI to predict HF from standard 12-lead ECG signals underlining the potential of such an approach. The observed overestimation of the diagnostic ability in artificial ECG databases compared to patient-level data stipulate the need for robust prospective studies.", "Early detection of gait abnormalities is critical for preventing severe injuries in future falls. The timed up and go (TUG) test is a commonly used clinical gait screening test; however, the interpretation of its results is limited to the TUG total time.\nWhat is diagnostic accuracy of the low-cost, markerless, automated gait analyzer, with the aid of vision-based artificial intelligence technology, which extract gait spatiotemporal features and screen for abnormal walking patterns through video recordings of the TUG test?\nOur dataset contained retrospective data from outpatients from the Department of Neurology or Rehabilitation of two tertiary hospitals in Shanghai. A panel of three expert neurologists specialized in movement disorders reviewed the gait performance in each TUG video, and labeled them separately, with the most commonly assigned label being used as the reference standard. The gait analyzer performed the AlphaPose algorithm to track the human joint position and calculated the spatiotemporal parameters by filtering and double-threshold signal detection. Gait spatiotemporal features and expert labels were input into machine learning models, and the accuracy of each model was tested with leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV).\nA total of 284 participants were recruited. Among these, 100 were labeled as having abnormal gait performance by experts. The Naive Bayes classifier achieved the best performance with a full-data accuracy of 90.14% and a LOOCV accuracy of 89.08% for screening abnormal gait performance.\nThis study is the first to investigate the accuracy of a vision-based intelligent gait analyzer for screening abnormal clinical gait performance. By virtue of a pose estimation algorithm and machine learning models, our intelligent gait analyzer can detect abnormal walking patterns approximate to judgements made by experienced neurologists, which is expected to be a supplementary gait assessment protocol for basic-level doctors in the future.", "Autonomous driving technologies often use state-of-the-art artificial intelligence algorithms to understand the relationship between the vehicle and the external environment, to predict the changes of the environment, and then to plan and control the behaviors of the vehicle accordingly. The complexity of such technologies makes it challenging to evaluate the performance of autonomous driving systems and to find ways to improve them. The current approaches to evaluating such autonomous driving systems largely use a single score to indicate the overall performance of a system, but domain experts have difficulties in understanding how individual components or algorithms in an autonomous driving system may contribute to the score. To address this problem, we collaborate with domain experts on autonomous driving algorithms, and propose a visual evaluation method for autonomous driving. Our method considers the data generated in all components during the whole process of autonomous driving, including perception results, planning routes, prediction of obstacles, various controlling parameters, and evaluation of comfort. We develop a visual analytics workflow to integrate an evaluation mathematical model with adjustable parameters, support the evaluation of the system from the level of the overall performance to the level of detailed measures of individual components, and to show both evaluation scores and their contributing factors. Our implemented visual analytics system provides an overview evaluation score at the beginning and shows the animation of the dynamic change of the scores at each period. Experts can interactively explore the specific component at different time periods and identify related factors. With our method, domain experts not only learn about the performance of an autonomous driving system, but also identify and access the problematic parts of each component. Our visual evaluation system can be applied to the autonomous driving simulation system and used for various evaluation cases. The results of using our system in some simulation cases and the feedback from involved domain experts confirm the usefulness and efficiency of our method in helping people gain in-depth insight into autonomous driving systems.", "The lack of availability of disability data has been identified as a major challenge hindering continuous disability equity monitoring. It is important to develop a platform that enables searching for disability data to expose systemic discrimination and social exclusion, which increase vulnerability to inequitable social conditions.\nOur project aims to create an accessible and multilingual pilot disability website that structures and integrates data about people with disabilities and provides data for national and international disability advocacy communities. The platform will be endowed with a document upload function with hybrid (automated and manual) paragraph tagging, while the querying function will involve an intelligent natural language search in the supported languages.\nWe have designed and implemented a virtual community platform using Wikibase, Semantic Web, machine learning, and web programming tools to enable disability communities to upload and search for disability documents. The platform data model is based on an ontology we have designed following the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD). The virtual community facilitates the uploading and sharing of validated information, and supports disability rights advocacy by enabling dissemination of knowledge.\nUsing health informatics and artificial intelligence techniques (namely Semantic Web, machine learning, and natural language processing techniques), we were able to develop a pilot virtual community that supports disability rights advocacy by facilitating uploading, sharing, and accessing disability data. The system consists of a website on top of a Wikibase (a Semantic Web-based datastore). The virtual community accepts 4 types of users: information producers, information consumers, validators, and administrators. The virtual community enables the uploading of documents, semiautomatic tagging of their paragraphs with meaningful keywords, and validation of the process before uploading the data to the disability Wikibase. Once uploaded, public users (information consumers) can perform a semantic search using an intelligent and multilingual search engine (QAnswer). Further enhancements of the platform are planned.\nThe platform ontology is flexible and can accommodate advocacy reports and disability policy and legislation from specific jurisdictions, which can be accessed in relation to the CRPD articles. The platform ontology can be expanded to fit international contexts. The virtual community supports information upload and search. Semiautomatic tagging and intelligent multilingual semantic search using natural language are enabled using artificial intelligence techniques, namely Semantic Web, machine learning, and natural language processing.", "Cerebral palsy (CP) is the most common motor disability in childhood. In addition to motor impairment, it is frequently accompanied by intellectual disability (ID). We aimed to investigate the associations between motor functions, quality of life (QoL) and maternal psychopathology in children with CP of different intelligence levels.\nIn total, 37 children and adolescents (16 females and 21 males) between 4 and 18 years of age diagnosed with CP were recruited from a Pediatric Neurology Outpatient Clinic. Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) and Bimanual Fine Motor Function (BFMF) were used for the children`s motor functions assessment. Quality of life was determined by the caregivers with Pediatric Quality Of Life Inventory-Parent version (PedsQL-P). Maternal anxiety and depression levels were assessed using Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI).\nModerate-severe ID (n=19)(13.5%, 37.8%) and normal IQ-mild ID (n=18) (32.4 %,16.2%) groups were evaluated in this study. GMFCS level 2 was more frequent in both groups. The majority of the severe-moderate ID group was at BFMF level 4, while the normal IQ-mild ID group was at BFMF level 2. PedsQL-P scores of children with CP, maternal BAI scores, and maternal BDI scores did not differ between the two groups (p > 0.05). Psychosocial PedsQL scores had a moderate negative correlation with the maternal BAI scores (r=- 0.41, p < 0.05). There was also a moderate positive correlations between the ages of children and maternal BDI scores (r=0.34, p < 0.05).\nOur results demonstrated that maternal anxiety was correlated with psychosocial QoL in children with CP. Maternal depression scores increasing with the ages of the children with CP may also indicate the social support needs for mothers with children of chronic diseases. Further studies may reveal the associations with other biopsychosocial factors in children with CP of different intelligence levels by using longitudinal study designs with larger sample sizes.", "As an art collective Cesar & Lois develops projects that examine sociotechnical systems, attempting to challenge anthropocentric technological pathways while linking to intelligences sourced in biological circuitry. As artists we imagine new configurations for what we understand as (social, economic, technological) networks and intelligences. With this ecosystemic approach we consider the possibility of an artificial intelligence (AI) that supports well-being in a broad sense, accommodating relationships across different layers of living worlds and involving local and global communities of all kinds. This thinking is grounded in research by theorists across disciplines, including communications and media theory, microbiology, anthropology, decolonial studies, social ecology, sociology and environmental psychology. At a time when human beings and their ecosystems face grave threats due to climate change and a global pandemic, we are rethinking the basis for our AIs, and for the resulting decision-making on behalf of societies and ecosystems. Creative projects by Cesar & Lois provide alternative conceptual models for thinking across networks, reframing the artists' and potentially viewers' understanding of what motivates and shapes societies. Referencing a series of artworks and the theories that underpin them, this article envisages a sociotechnical framework that takes into account ecosystems and challenges the philosophical orientations that guide society. Degenerative Cultures is an artwork in which the artists overlap microbiological organisms, AI and human systems as a speculative restructuring of networks across human and nonhuman entities. The push for ecosystemic technologies and intelligences is linked to the expansion of community to include planetary constituents, such as nonhuman beings and environments. The artists posit that such ecosystemic networks would be capable of taking into account the planet's human societies as well as nonhuman species and their environments, broadening the concept of community well-being and shifting the technological architecture to meet the complex needs of the planet and its constituent parts. The experimental series, [ECO]nomic Revolution, layers Physarum polycephalum, or slime mold, over the mapped demographics of human cities. The species polycephalum references multi-brains, and implies a decentralized logic, which for the non-neurological microbiological network translates to the sharing of nutrients and regulated growth across a culture. Assuming a perspective based in the arts, this proposition imagines a shift from the dominant conceptions of AI as an individual intelligence and frames it as part of a network that necessarily includes ecosystems. We envision the creation of sociotechnical systems that could be modeled on networked lifeforms that have optimized themselves across millions of years, like the organism Physarum polycephalum, which occurs globally in moist environments, or like those microbial populations within and outside of human bodies, whose percussive biological processing interacts with and alters many layers of lifeforms. We argue that an environmentally responsive intelligence based on relationships across living systems potentially serves a broad community composed of diverse human populations, nonhuman beings and ecosystems.", "Human papillomavirus (HPV) causes the most prevalent sexually transmitted infection (STI) in the United States. Sexually active young adults are susceptible to HPV, accounting for approximately 50% of new STIs. Oncogenic HPV subtypes 16 and 18 are associated with squamous intraepithelial lesions and cancers and are mostly preventable through prophylactic HPV vaccination. Accordingly, this study's objectives are to (1) summarize SDoH barriers and implication for low HPV vaccination rates among young adults (18-26 years), (2) propose a digital health solution that utilizes the PHL to collect, integrate, and manage personalized sexual and health information, and (3) describe the features of the PHL-based app. Through the application of novel techniques from artificial intelligence, specifically knowledge representation, semantic web, and natural language processing, this proposed PHL-based application will compile clinical, biomedical, and SDoH data from multi-dimensional sources. Therefore, this application will provide digital health interventions that are customized to individuals' specific needs and capacities. The PHL-based application could promote management and usage of personalized digital health information to facilitate precision health promotion thereby, informing health decision-making regarding HPV vaccinations, routine HPV/STI testing, cancer screenings, vaccine safety/efficacy/side effects, and safe sexual practices. In addition to detecting vaccine hesitancy, disparities and perceived barriers, this application could address participants' specific needs/challenges with navigating health literacy, technical skills, peer influence, education, language, cultural and spiritual beliefs. Precision health promotion focused on improving knowledge acquisition and information-seeking behaviors, promoting safe sexual practices, increasing HPV vaccinations, and facilitating cancer screenings could be effective in preventing HPV-associated cancers.", "Multi-view clustering has become an active topic in artificial intelligence. Yet, similar investigation for graph-structured data clustering has been absent so far. To fill this gap, we present a Multi-View Graph embedding Clustering network (MVGC). Specifically, unlike traditional multi-view construction methods, which are only suitable to describe Euclidean structure data, we leverage Euler transform to augment the node attribute, as a new view descriptor, for non-Euclidean structure data. Meanwhile, we impose block diagonal representation constraint, which is measured by the \u21131,2-norm, on self-expression coefficient matrix to well explore the cluster structure. By doing so, the learned view-consensus coefficient matrix well encodes the discriminative information. Moreover, we make use of the learned clustering labels to guide the learnings of node representation and coefficient matrix, where the latter is used in turn to conduct the subsequent clustering. In this way, clustering and representation learning are seamlessly connected, with the aim to achieve better clustering performance. Extensive experimental results indicate that MVGC is superior to 11 state-of-the-art methods on four benchmark datasets. In particular, MVGC achieves an Accuracy of 96.17% (53.31%) on the ACM (IMDB) dataset, which is an up to 2.85% (1.97%) clustering performance improvement compared with the strongest baseline.", "As a fundamental problem in chemistry, retrosynthesis aims at designing reaction pathways and intermediates for a target compound. The goal of artificial intelligence (AI)-aided retrosynthesis is to automate this process by learning from the previous chemical reactions to make new predictions. Although several models have demonstrated their potentials for automated retrosynthesis, there is still a significant need to further enhance the prediction accuracy to a more practical level. Here we propose a local retrosynthesis framework called LocalRetro, motivated by the chemical intuition that the molecular changes occur mostly locally during the chemical reactions. This differs from nearly all existing retrosynthesis methods that suggest reactants based on the global structures of the molecules, often containing fine details not directly relevant to the reactions. This local concept yields local reaction templates involving the atom and bond edits. Because the remote functional groups can also affect the overall reaction path as a secondary aspect, the proposed locally encoded retrosynthesis model is then further refined to account for the nonlocal effects of chemical reaction through a global attention mechanism. Our model shows a promising 89.5 and 99.2% round-trip accuracy at top-1 and top-5 predictions for the USPTO-50K dataset containing 50\u202f016 reactions. We further demonstrate the validity of LocalRetro on a large dataset containing 479\u202f035 reactions (UTPTO-MIT) with comparable round-trip top-1 and top-5 accuracy of 87.0 and 97.4%, respectively. The practical application of the model is also demonstrated by correctly predicting the synthesis pathways of five drug candidate molecules from various literature.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) offers new possibilities for hit and lead finding in medicinal chemistry. Several instances of AI have been used for prospective de novo drug design. Among these, chemical language models have been shown to perform well in various experimental scenarios. In this study, we provide a hands-on introduction to chemical language modeling. A technique based on recurrent neural networks is discussed in detail, together with a step-by-step guide to applying this AI method for focused compound library design. The program code is freely available at URL: github.com/ETHmodlab/de_novo_design_RNN .", "To develop and validate an artificial intelligence framework for identifying multiple retinal lesions at image level and performing an explainable macular disease diagnosis at eye level in optical coherence tomography images.\nA total of 26,815 optical coherence tomography images were collected from 865 eyes, and 9 retinal lesions and 3 macular diseases were labeled by ophthalmologists, including diabetic macular edema and dry/wet age-related macular degeneration. We applied deep learning to classify retinal lesions at image level and random forests to achieve an explainable disease diagnosis at eye level. The performance of the integrated two-stage framework was evaluated and compared with human experts.\nOn testing data set of 2,480 optical coherence tomography images from 80 eyes, the deep learning model achieved an average area under curve of 0.978 (95% confidence interval, 0.971-0.983) for lesion classification. In addition, random forests performed accurate disease diagnosis with a 0% error rate, which achieved the same accuracy as one of the human experts and was better than the other three experts. It also revealed that the detection of specific lesions in the center of macular region had more contribution to macular disease diagnosis.\nThe integrated method achieved high accuracy and interpretability in retinal lesion classification and macular disease diagnosis in optical coherence tomography images and could have the potential to facilitate the clinical diagnosis.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) is an umbrella term used to describe a cluster of interrelated fields. Machine learning (ML) refers to a model that learns from past data to predict future data. Medicine and particularly gastroenterology and hepatology, are data-rich fields with extensive data repositories, and therefore fruitful ground for AI/ML-based software applications. In this study, we comprehensively review the current applications of AI/ML-based models in these fields and the opportunities that arise from their application. Specifically, we refer to the applications of AI/ML-based models in prevention, diagnosis, management, and prognosis of gastrointestinal bleeding, inflammatory bowel diseases, gastrointestinal premalignant and malignant lesions, other nonmalignant gastrointestinal lesions and diseases, hepatitis B and C infection, chronic liver diseases, hepatocellular carcinoma, cholangiocarcinoma, and primary sclerosing cholangitis. At the same time, we identify the major challenges that restrain the widespread use of these models in healthcare in an effort to explore ways to overcome them. Notably, we elaborate on the concerns regarding intrinsic biases, data protection, cybersecurity, intellectual property, liability, ethical challenges, and transparency. Even at a slower pace than anticipated, AI is infiltrating the healthcare industry. AI in healthcare will become a reality, and every physician will have to engage with it by necessity.", "Electronic skin (E-skin) based on tactile sensors has great significance in next-generation electronics such as biomedical application and artificial intelligence that requires interaction with humans. To mimic the properties of human skin, high flexibility, excellent sensing capability, and sufficient spatial resolution through high-level sensor integration are required. Here, we report a highly sensitive pressure sensor matrix based on a piezoresistive cellulose/single-walled carbon nanotube-entangled fiber network, which forms its own porous structure enabling a superior pressure sensor with a high sensitivity (9.097 kPa-1), a fast response speed (<2 ms), and orders of magnitude detection range with a detection limit of 1 Pa. Furthermore, the remarkable device expandability based on the ease of patterning and scalability allows easy implementation of a large-area pressure sensor matrix which has 2304 (48 \u00d7 48) pixels. Combined with a real-time pressure distribution monitoring system, a flexible 3D touch sensor that simultaneously displays plane coordinates and pressure information and a scanning device that detects the morphology of the soft body 3D surface are successfully demonstrated.", "Developing tools for efficiently measuring cognitive change specifically and brain health generally-whether for clinical use or as endpoints in clinical trials-is a major challenge, particularly for conditions such as Alzheimer's disease. Technology such as connected devices and advances in artificial intelligence offer the possibility of creating and deploying clinical-grade tools with high sensitivity, rapidly, cheaply, and non-intrusively. Starting from a widely-used paper and pencil cognitive status test-The Clock Drawing Test-we combined a digital input device to capture time-stamped drawing coordinates with a machine learning analysis of drawing behavior to create DCTclock\u2122, an automated analysis of nuances in cognitive performance beyond successful task completion. Development and validation was conducted on a dataset of 1,833 presumed cognitively unimpaired and clinically diagnosed cognitively impaired individuals with varied neurological conditions. We benchmarked DCTclock against existing clock scoring systems and the Mini-Mental Status Examination, a widely-used but lengthier cognitive test, and showed that DCTclock offered a significant improvement in the detection of early cognitive impairment and the ability to characterize individuals along the Alzheimer's disease trajectory. This offers an example of a robust framework for creating digital biomarkers that can be used clinically and in research for assessing neurological function.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) has evolved over the last few years; its use in DR screening has been demonstrated in multiple evidences across the globe. However, there are concerns right from the data acquisition, bias in data, difficulty in comparing between different algorithm, challenges in machine learning, its application in different group of population, and human barrier to AI adoption in health care. There are also legal and ethical concerns related to AI. The tension between risks and concerns on one hand versus potential and opportunity on the other have driven a need for authorities to implement policies for AI in DR screening to address these issues. The policy makers should support and facilitate research and development of AI in healthcare, but at the same time, it has to be ensured that the use of AI in healthcare aligns with recognized standards of safety, efficacy, and equity. It is essential to ensure that algorithms, datasets, and decisions are auditable and when applied to medical care (such as screening, diagnosis, or treatment) are clinically validated and explainable. Policy frameworks should require design of AI systems in health care that are informed by real-world workflow and human-centric design. Lastly, it should be ensured that healthcare AI solutions align with all relevant ethical obligations, from design to development to use and to be delivered properly in the real world.", "Optical implementations of neural networks (ONNs) herald the next-generation high-speed and energy-efficient deep learning computing by harnessing the technical advantages of large bandwidth and high parallelism of optics. However, due to the problems of the incomplete numerical domain, limited hardware scale, or inadequate numerical accuracy, the majority of existing ONNs were studied for basic classification tasks. Given that regression is a fundamental form of deep learning and accounts for a large part of current artificial intelligence applications, it is necessary to master deep learning regression for further development and deployment of ONNs. Here, we demonstrate a silicon-based optical coherent dot-product chip (OCDC) capable of completing deep learning regression tasks. The OCDC adopts optical fields to carry out operations in the complete real-value domain instead of in only the positive domain. Via reusing, a single chip conducts matrix multiplications and convolutions in neural networks of any complexity. Also, hardware deviations are compensated via in-situ backpropagation control provided the simplicity of chip architecture. Therefore, the OCDC meets the requirements for sophisticated regression tasks and we successfully demonstrate a representative neural network, the AUTOMAP (a cutting-edge neural network model for image reconstruction). The quality of reconstructed images by the OCDC and a 32-bit digital computer is comparable. To the best of our knowledge, there is no precedent of performing such state-of-the-art regression tasks on ONN chips. It is anticipated that the OCDC can promote the novel accomplishment of ONNs in modern AI applications including autonomous driving, natural language processing, and scientific study.", "The increased burden of diabetes in India has resulted in an increase in the complications of diabetes including sight-threatening diabetic retinopathy (DR). Visual impairment and blindness due to DR can be prevented by early detection and management of sight-threatening DR. Life-long evaluation by repetitive retinal screening of people with diabetes is an essential strategy as DR has an asymptomatic presentation. Fundus examination by trained ophthalmologists and fundus photography are established modes of screening. Various modes of opportunistic screening have been followed in India. Hospital-based screening (diabetes care/eye care) and community-based screening are the common modes. Tele-ophthalmology programs based on retinal imaging, remote interpretation, and grading of DR by trained graders/ophthalmologists have facilitated greater coverage of DR screening and enabled timely referral of those with sight-threatening DR. DR screening programs use nonmydriatic or mydriatic fundus cameras for retinal photography. Hand-held/smartphone-based fundus cameras that are portable, less expensive, and easy to use in remote places are gaining popularity. Good retinal image quality and accurate diagnosis play an important role in reducing unnecessary referrals. Recent advances like nonmydriatic ultrawide field fundus photography can be used for DR screening, though likely to be more expensive. The advent of artificial intelligence and deep learning has raised the possibility of automated detection of DR. Efforts to increase the awareness regarding DR is essential to ensure compliance to regular follow-up. Cost-effective sustainable models will ensure systematic nation-wide DR screening in the country.", "The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has caused havoc worldwide. The tests currently used to diagnose COVID-19 are based on real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), computed tomography medical imaging techniques and immunoassays. It takes 2 days to obtain results from the RT-PCR test and also shortage of test kits creating a requirement for alternate and rapid methods to accurately diagnose COVID-19. Application of artificial intelligence technologies such as the Internet of Things, machine learning tools and big data analysis to COVID-19 diagnosis could yield rapid and accurate results. The neural networks and machine learning tools can also be used to develop potential drug molecules. Pharmaceutical companies face challenges linked to the costs of drug molecules, research and development efforts, reduced efficiency of drugs, safety concerns and the conduct of clinical trials. In this review, relevant features of artificial intelligence and their potential applications in COVID-19 diagnosis and drug development are highlighted.", "Although graduate medical education accrediting bodies recognize the importance of leadership for residents and encourage curricular development, it remains unclear which competencies are most important for early career physicians to possess.\nTo generate a prioritized list of essential postgraduate leadership competencies to inform best practices for future curricular development.\nIn 2019, we used a Delphi approach, which allows for generation of consensus, to survey internal medicine (IM) physicians in leadership roles with expertise in medical education and/or leadership programming within national professional societies. Panelists ranked a comprehensive list of established leadership competencies for health care professionals, across 3 established domains (character, emotional intelligence, and cognitive skills), on importance for categorical IM residents to perform by the end of residency. Respondents also identified number of content hours and pedagogical format best suited to teach each skill.\nSixteen and 14 panelists participated in Delphi rounds 1 and 2, respectively (88% response rate). Most were female (71%) and senior (64% in practice > 15 years, 57% full professor). All practiced in academic environments and all US regions were represented. The final consensus list included 12 \"essential\" and 9 \"very important\" leadership skills across all 3 leadership domains. Emotional intelligence and character domains were equally represented in the consensus list despite being disproportionately underweighted initially. Panelists most frequently recommended content delivery via mentorship/coaching, work-based reflection, and interactive discussion.\nThis study's results suggest that postgraduate curricular interventions should emphasize emotional intelligence and character domains of leadership and prioritize coaching, discussion, and reflection for delivery.", "Blood oxygen level dependent magnetic resonance imaging (BOLD-MRI) is a kind of non-invasive MRI technology which reflects the tissue blood oxyen levels. This stuy aims to explore the value of radiomics based on BOLD-MRI in differentiating malignant from benign renal tumors.\nA total of 141 patients with renal tumors confirmed by pathology were retrospectively analyzed. Seventy-four men and sixty-seven women, aged 26-78 years, with a median age of 56, were included. In all patients, 118 with malignant tumors and 23 with benign tumors were confirmed. All the patients underwent renal T1 weighted imaging (T1WI), T2 weighted imaging (T2WI), and BOLD-MRI scan within 2 weeks before surgery. The patients were randomly assigned into a training group (benign, n=17; malignant, n=83) and a test group (benign, n=6; malignant, n=35). Two radiologists (A and B), who were blind to the pathological results, delineated the regions of interest (ROI) on the maximum axial slices of the tumors. Radiologist B delineated the ROI again at an interval of one month. The intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) was used to evaluate inter-observer and intra-observer repeatability and ICC>0.75 represented as a good consistency. All the T2* Mapping images and the related ROI files were loaded into the Artificial Intelligence Kit software. A total of 396 texture features, which were calculated based on morphology, histogram, gray level co-occurrence matrix, gray-scale run length matrix, gray-scale area size matrix and gray-scale dependent matrix, were extracted from each ROI. The lowest redundancy and the highest correlation were filtered using minimum redundancy maximum relevance (mRMR) algorithm. Then least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) algorithm was used to screened out the most predictive features. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to develop the prediction model after feature selection. The radiomics signature score (Radscore) of each case was calculated. The Wilcoxon test was used to compare the difference in the Radscore between benign and malignant renal tumors in the training and test groups. The diagnostic performance of the model in differentiating malignant from benign renal tumors was evaluated with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and leave group out cross validation. The clinical application value of the model was evaluated by decision curve analysis (DCA).\nThere was significant difference in the age between the patients with benign and those with malignant tumors (t=4.383, P<0.001). There were no significant differences in gender composition and in the largest tumor diameter between the 2 groups (\u03c72=3.452, P=0.063; t=1.432, P=0.154). The ICC values of all the texture features for the inter-observer repeatability were ranged from 0.71 to 0.87, and the ICC values for the intra-observer repeatability were ranged from 0.76 to 0.91. Thirty features with the lowest redundancy and the highest correlation were screened out. The most predictive 12 features were filtered out. The Radscores of malignant tumors in the training and test groups were higher than those of benign tumors (P<0.001 and P=0.006, respectively). The areas under the ROC curve of the model developed by multivariable logistic regression for differentiating malignant from benign renal tumors in the training and test groups were 0.881 and 0.706, with the accuracy at 82.93% and 79.00%, the sensitivity at 82.86% and 77.11%, and the specificities at 83.33% and 88.24%, respectively. The results of decision curve analysis showed that the net benefit of the radiomics model was higher than that of \"all malignant\" or \"all benign\" when the threshold was higher than 0.3.\nBOLD-MRI-based radiomics can be a reliable non-invasive approach for differentiating renal malignant tumors from benign tumors.\n\u76ee\u7684:

intelligence, event prediction models are abundant. However, considering the limitation of the electronic medical record-based model, including the temporally skewed prediction and the record itself, these models could be delayed or could yield errors.\nIn this study, we aim to develop multiple event prediction models in intensive care units to overcome their temporal skewness and evaluate their robustness against delayed and erroneous input.\nA total of 21,738 patients were included in the development cohort. Three events-death, sepsis, and acute kidney injury-were predicted. To overcome the temporal skewness, we developed three models for each event, which predicted the events in advance of three prespecified timepoints. Additionally, to evaluate the robustness against input error and delays, we added simulated errors and delayed input and calculated changes in the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) values.\nMost of the AUROC and area under the precision-recall curve values of each model were higher than those of the conventional scores, as well as other machine learning models previously used. In the error input experiment, except for our proposed model, an increase in the noise added to the model lowered the resulting AUROC value. However, the delayed input did not show the performance decreased in this experiment.\nFor a prediction model that was applicable in the real world, we considered not only performance but also temporal skewness, delayed input, and input error.", "Artificial Intelligence and machine learning (ML) methods are promising for risk-stratification, but the added benefit over traditional statistical methods remains unclear. We compared predictive models developed using machine learning (ML) methods to the Canadian Syncope Risk Score (CSRS), a risk-tool developed with logistic regression for predicting serious adverse events (SAE) after emergency department (ED) disposition for syncope. We used the prospective multicenter cohort data collected for CSRS development at 11 Canadian EDs over an 8-year period to develop four ML models to predict 30-day SAE (death, arrhythmias, MI, structural heart disease, pulmonary embolism, hemorrhage) after ED disposition. The CSRS derivation and validation cohorts were used for training and testing, respectively, and the 43 variables used included demographics, medical history, vital signs, ECG findings, blood tests and the diagnostic impression of the emergency physician. Performance was assessed using the area under the receiver-operating-characteristics curve (AUC) and calibration curves. Of the 4030 patients in the training set and 3819 patients in the test set overall, 286 (3.6%) patients suffered 30-day SAE. The AUCs for model validation in test data were CSRS 0.902 (0.877-0.926), regularized regression 0.903 (0.877-0.928), gradient boosting 0.914 (0.894-0.934), deep neural network 0.906 (0.883-0.929), simplified gradient boosting 0.904 (0.881-0.927). The AUCs and calibration slopes for the ML models and CSRS were similar. Two ML models used fewer predictors than the CSRS but matched its performance. Overall,\u00a0the ML models matched the CSRS in performance, with some models using fewer predictors.", "Schaaf-Yang syndrome (SYS) is a rare neurodevelopmental disorder that shares multiple clinical features with the genetically related Prader-Willi syndrome. It usually manifests at birth with muscular hypotonia in all and distal joint contractures in a majority of affected individuals. Gastrointestinal/feeding problems are particularly pronounced in infancy and childhood, but can transition to hyperphagia and obesity in adulthood. Respiratory distress is present in many individuals at birth, with approximately half requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation, and approximately 20% requiring tracheostomy. Skeletal manifestations such as joint contractures, scoliosis, and decreased bone mineral density are frequently observed. All affected individuals show developmental delay, resulting in intellectual disability of variable degree, from low-normal intelligence to severe intellectual disability. Other findings may include short stature, seizures, eye anomalies, and hypogonadism.\nThe diagnosis of Schaaf-Yang syndrome is established in a proband by identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in the paternally derived MAGEL2 allele by molecular genetic testing. The 15q11.2 locus that includes MAGEL2 is maternally imprinted, meaning that only the paternally derived allele is expressed while the maternally derived allele is inactivated.\nTreatment of manifestations: Feeding therapy or supplemental tube feeding may be required for persistent feeding issues; assisted ventilation to include either noninvasive or invasive intervention; CPAP for sleep apnea; growth hormone therapy in those with short stature and/or linear growth concerns; standard therapy for gastroesophageal reflux disease, metabolic syndrome, constipation, skeletal abnormalities, low bone mineral density, developmental delay/cognitive impairment, seizures, eye anomalies, undescended testes, hypogonadism and pubertal abnormalities, and hypothyroidism. Surveillance: At each visit: measurement of growth parameters and evaluation of nutritional status & safety of oral intake; assessment of developmental progress, educational needs, and self-help skills; monitor for signs and symptoms of constipation, sleep apnea, respiratory insufficiency, scoliosis, progression of contractures, and puberty (from ages 10-17 years). Behavioral assessment annually; DXA scan every two years starting at the age five years, transitioning to every three to five years in adulthood; ophthalmology evaluation as recommended by an ophthalmologist; polysomnography annually for those on long-term GH therapy or as recommended by a sleep specialist.\nSchaaf-Yang syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant, maternally imprinted manner (i.e., a heterozygous pathogenic variant on the paternally derived MAGEL2 allele results in disease; a pathogenic variant on the maternally derived MAGEL2 allele does not result in disease because normally the maternally derived MAGEL2 allele is silenced). Approximately 50% of individuals diagnosed with SYS inherited a MAGEL2 pathogenic variant from a clinically unaffected father and the remainder are de novo. If the father of the proband is heterozygous for the MAGEL2 pathogenic variant identified in the proband, the risk to both male and female sibs is 50%. The recurrence risk within the family of the proband's mother is that of the general population. Once the MAGEL2 pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing are possible.", "This systematic review aims to examine the effectiveness of online mental health interventions for youth.\nWe searched seven electronic databases (PubMed, PsycINFO, Medline, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science and SCOPUS) for the past 10 years to identify randomized controlled trials which have evaluated the use of telehealth interventions for young people with mental health problems. The included studies were assessed for quality and risk of bias.\nForty-five randomized controlled trials (n\u2009=\u200913,291 participants) were eligible for this review. Most studies (35 trials) evaluated the use of web-based self-help platforms to deliver cognitive behavioural therapy (14 trials), mindfulness (four trials), acceptance commitment therapy (five trials) and positive psychology (two trials). Mobile/computer applications were used to deliver cognitive behavioural therapy (four trials) and coping strategies training (two trials). Web-based synchronous chat (one trial) was used to assist communication between counsellors and participants. Three studies used artificial intelligence-based conversational agents to deliver cognitive behavioural therapy (two trials) and problem-solving-strategy training (one trial). Eighty-two percent (n\u2009=\u200937) identified the participants as student population (i.e. university students, high school students). Sixty-four percent (n\u2009=\u200929) of the telehealth interventions were found to be effective in managing depression, anxiety, stress, insomnia and improving quality of life when compared with control conditions.\nOnline mental health interventions were found to be effective in managing diverse mental health conditions among youth. Online self-help platforms were the most frequently used modality and artificial intelligence-based chatbots are merging as potential solutions. Future research is warranted to investigate the solutions to improve the retention rate and satisfaction of telehealth interventions among this population.", "The analysis of large-scale multimodal data has become very popular recently. Image captioning, whose goal is to describe the content of image with natural language automatically, is an essential and challenging task in artificial intelligence. Commonly, most existing image caption methods utilize the mixture of Convolutional Neural Network and Recurrent Neural Network framework. These methods either pay attention to global representation at the image level or only focus on the specific concepts, such as regions and objects. To make the most of characteristics about a given image, in this study, we present a novel model named Multilevel Attention Networks and Policy Reinforcement Learning for image caption generation. Specifically, our model is composed of a multilevel attention network module and a policy reinforcement learning module. In the multilevel attention network, the object-attention network aims to capture global and local details about objects, whereas the region-attention network obtains global and local features about regions. After that, a policy reinforcement learning algorithm is adopted to overcome the exposure bias problem in the training phase and solve the loss-evaluation mismatching problem at the caption generation stage. With the attention network and policy algorithm, our model can automatically generate accurate and natural sentences for any particular image. We carry out extensive experiments on the MSCOCO and Flickr30k data sets, demonstrating that our model is superior to other competitive methods.", "To examine the impact of emotional intelligence on the effective implementation of a professional practice model in a specialised cancer centre.\nThe study used a cross-sectional design with 580 frontline nurses at King Hussein Cancer Center, Jordan. The sample was selected using a convenience sampling technique. Data were collected using two self-administered questionnaires to measure emotional intelligence and professional practice.\nThe overall mean value of emotional intelligence was 5.60 out of 6 (SD=0.78), while the overall mean value for the implementation of the professional practice model was 4.76/5 (SD=0.59). The results showed that the overall mean value of emotional intelligence had a significant positive correlation with the effective implementation of the professional practice model (r=0.580, P<0.001), even after adjusting for the participants' demographics (P<0.001).\nEmotional intelligence can be considered a predictor for the effective implementation of a professional practice model.", "Anastomotic leakage (AL) in left-sided colorectal cancer is a serious complication, with an incidence rate of 6-18%. We developed a novel predictive model for AL in colorectal surgery with double-stapling technique (DST) anastomosis using auto-artificial intelligence (AI).\nA total of 256 patients who underwent curative surgery for left-sided colorectal cancer between 2017 and 2021 were included. In addition to conventional clinicopathological factors, we included the type of circular stapler using DST, conventional double-row circular stapler (DCS) or EEA\u2122 circular stapler with Tri-Staple\u2122 technology, 28 mm Medium/Thick (Covidien, New Haven, CT, USA) which had triple-row circular stapler (TCS) as a covariate. Auto-AI software Prediction One (Sony Network Communications Inc.) was used to predict AL with 5-fold cross validation. Predictive accuracy was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. Prediction One also evaluated the 'importance of variables' (IOV) using a method based on permutation feature importance.\nThe area under the curve of the AI model was 0.766. The type of circular stapler used was the most influential factor contributing to AL (IOV=0.551).\nThis auto-AI predictive model demonstrated an improvement in accuracy compared to the conventional model. It was suggested that use of a TCS may contribute to a reduction in the AL rate.", "To perform a scoping review to determine what is known about emotional intelligence (EI) in undergraduate medical education\u00a0(UME). Two main questions were asked: A. What medical student characteristics are associated with EI? Are there correlations with demographic or other factors? B. What research studies have been done on EI in UME? For example, is there evidence EI changes over time as a result of personal experiences? Should EI be used as an admission criterion? Can EI improve as a result of experiences or deliberate interventions?\nThe authors searched four databases (PubMed, PsycInfo, Education Resources Information Center, and Web of Science) for all papers published up to and including December 2020. Two reviewers independently screened articles to determine if they met inclusion criteria. All authors extracted and analyzed data.\nA set of 1520 papers on the topic of emotional intelligence was identified, with 119 papers meeting inclusion criteria. Most studies were done at international locations with only 17 done at US medical schools. Seventy-five were cohort or cross-sectional studies. Study populations were mixed among the studies, with year of medical study, inclusion of other healthcare students, and participation rates among the inter-study differences noted.\nNumerous gaps in the literature on EI exist with several points being clear: (1) there is disagreement on the definition of EI, (2) it is undetermined whether EI is a trait or an ability, and (3) there is marked variability among the instruments used to measure EI. It is also becoming apparent that using EI determination may be helpful as a component of the admission process, higher EI is likely related to improved clinical reasoning, and higher EI contributes to more effective stress management.", "With the advent of the 5G era, humans must not only learn the knowledge and skills of cross-border integration but must also get to grips with the breadth and efficiency of artificial intelligence (AI) technology in order to jointly overcome current difficulties and create a happy and beautiful life. In this article, we use the example of an elementary school to discuss the decision-making factors that influence teachers when choosing AI technology, where the digital content of schools is imported into artificial intelligence-based collaborative teaching. After discussing the relevant literature, this study will introduce the concept of digital media education, and then compare the development and application of smart technology and human-computer collaborative teaching methods, describing three key aspects and factors that influence elementary school teachers' choice of AI technology. There are 12 evaluation criteria in total. After the completion of expert questionnaires and data analysis, it was found that the main factors affecting teachers' choice of AI technology are \"collaborative tasks,\" \"functional characteristics,\" and \"modeling characteristics.\" In terms of evaluation criteria, the four most important aspects were found to be \"learning assistance,\" \"security,\" \"teaching observation,\" and \"record review.\" The results of this research analysis will help provide a reference for digital content development and individual recommendation services. In future work, this study can further discuss teaching innovations in digital media education, aimed at improving the quality and effectiveness of teaching and learning.", "Background: Pathologic myopia (PM) associated with myopic maculopathy (MM) and \"Plus\" lesions is a major cause of irreversible visual impairment worldwide. Therefore, we aimed to develop a series of deep learning algorithms and artificial intelligence (AI)-models for automatic PM identification, MM classification, and \"Plus\" lesion detection based on retinal fundus images. Materials and Methods: Consecutive 37,659 retinal fundus images from 32,419 patients were collected. After excluding 5,649 ungradable images, a total dataset of 32,010 color retinal fundus images was manually graded for training and cross-validation according to the META-PM classification. We also retrospectively recruited 1,000 images from 732 patients from the three other hospitals in Zhejiang Province, serving as the external validation dataset. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and quadratic-weighted kappa score were calculated to evaluate the classification algorithms. The precision, recall, and F1-score were calculated to evaluate the object detection algorithms. The performance of all the algorithms was compared with the experts' performance. To better understand the algorithms and clarify the direction of optimization, misclassification and visualization heatmap analyses were performed. Results: In five-fold cross-validation, algorithm I achieved robust performance, with accuracy = 97.36% (95% CI: 0.9697, 0.9775), AUC = 0.995 (95% CI: 0.9933, 0.9967), sensitivity = 93.92% (95% CI: 0.9333, 0.9451), and specificity = 98.19% (95% CI: 0.9787, 0.9852). The macro-AUC, accuracy, and quadratic-weighted kappa were 0.979, 96.74% (95% CI: 0.963, 0.9718), and 0.988 (95% CI: 0.986, 0.990) for algorithm II. Algorithm III achieved an accuracy of 0.9703 to 0.9941 for classifying the \"Plus\" lesions and an F1-score of 0.6855 to 0.8890 for detecting and localizing lesions. The performance metrics in external validation dataset were comparable to those of the experts and were slightly inferior to those of cross-validation. Conclusion: Our algorithms and AI-models were confirmed to achieve robust performance in real-world conditions. The application of our algorithms and AI-models has promise for facilitating clinical diagnosis and healthcare screening for PM on a large scale.", "Interchangeability-i.e., the capacity to change places with another-is necessary for military interprofessional health care teams (MIHTs) to provide around-the-clock patient care. However, while interchangeability is clearly a necessity for modern health care delivery, it raises uncomfortable questions for civilian health care teams where it is usually labeled as unsafe. This perception surfaces because interchangeability runs counter to some of health care's cultural beliefs including those around patient ownership and professional scopes of practice. It is, therefore, not surprising that little is known about whether and how some level of interchangeability can be harnessed to improve the productivity of health care teams overall. In this article, we explore the notion of interchangeability in the particular context of MIHTs given that these health care teams are familiar with it. This exploration will offer insights into how interchangeability could maximize civilian health care teams' capacity to adapt.\nWe conducted a secondary analysis of interview data as an analytic expansion: \"the kind of study in which the researcher makes further use of a primary data set in order to ask new or emerging questions that derive from having conducted the original analysis but were not envisioned within the original scope of the primary study aims\". Within our secondary analysis approach, we used thematic analysis as our analytical tool to describe (1) what interchangeability looks like in MIHT teams, (2) how it is fostered in MIHTs, and (3) how it is enacted in MIHTs.\nInterchangeability was realized in MIHTs when individual team members adapted to take on roles and/or tasks that were not clearly niched in their specific areas of expertise but instead drew on the broad foundation of their clinical skill set. Cross-training and distributed leadership were ways in which MIHT members described how interchangeability was fostered. Furthermore, five features of working within MIHT teams were identified as key conditions to enact interchangeability: knowing your team members; being able to work with what/who you have; actively seeking others' expertise; situating your role within the broader picture of the mission; and maintaining a learning/teaching mindset.\nInterchangeability can be understood through the theoretical lens of Swarm Intelligence and more specifically, the principle of collective self-healing-which is the ability of collectives to continue to successfully perform despite disruption, challenges, or the loss of a team member. Our findings highlight how MIHTs have adopted interchangeability in a wide array of contexts to realize collective self-healing. Despite the discomfort it provokes, we suggest that interchangeability could be a powerful asset to civilian health care teams.", "The use of artificial intelligence methods in drug safety began in the early 2000s with applications such as predicting bacterial mutagenicity and hERG inhibition. The field has been endlessly expanding ever since and the models have become more complex. These approaches are now integrated into molecule risk assessment processes along with in vitro and in vivo methods. Today, artificial intelligence can be used in every phase of drug discovery and development, from profiling chemical libraries in early discovery, to predicting off-target effects in the mid-discovery phase, to assessing potential mutagenic impurities in development and degradants as part of life cycle management. This chapter provides an overview of artificial intelligence in drug safety and describes its application throughout the entire discovery and development process.", "It is hypothesized that demographic variables and mRNA expression levels in the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) genes can be employed as potential biomarkers to predict bipolar disorder using artificial intelligence and machine learning approaches.\nTo determine bipolar status, we established a logistic ridge regression model resulting from the analysis of age, gender, and mRNA expression levels in 7 NMDAR genes in the blood of 51 bipolar patients and 139 unrelated healthy individuals in the Taiwanese population. The NMDAR genes encompasses COMT, GCAT, NRG1, PSAT1, SHMT2, SLC1A4, and SRR. We also compared our approach with various state-of-the-art algorithms such as support vector machine and C4.5 decision tree.\nThe analysis revealed that the mRNA expression levels of COMT, GCAT, NRG1, PSAT1, SHMT2, SLC1A4, and SRR were associated with bipolar disorder. Moreover, the logistic ridge regression model (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve\u00a0=\u00a00.922) performed maximally among predictive models to infer the complicated relationship between bipolar disorder and biomarkers. Additionally, the results for the age- and gender-matched cohort were similar to those of the unmatched cohort.\nThe cross-sectional study design limited the predictive value.\nThis is the first study demonstrating that the mRNA expression levels in the NMDAR genes may be altered in patients with bipolar disorder, thereby supporting the NMDAR hypothesis of bipolar disorder. The study also indicates that the mRNA expression levels in the NMDAR genes could serve as potential biomarkers to distinguish bipolar patients from healthy controls using artificial intelligence and machine learning approaches.", "Objective. Pilots are commonly exposed to some sources of emotional and cognitive stressors, especially for flight cadets, which have an important influence on flight safety. The present study aimed to study the relationship between emotional trait factors, emotional state, mental workload and simulated flight performance (SFP) under an acute psychological stress situation. Methods. Fifty-five undergraduates were included in the study. The Wong and Law emotional intelligence scale (WLEIS), state-trait anxiety inventory (STAI), stress rating questionnaire (SRQ) and National Aeronautics and Space Administration task load index (NASA-TLX) were used as data collection tools. Nine hours of simulated flight training were conducted in a simulator of the Type-6 Primary Trainer (Aviation University Air Force, China). The simulated flight assessment was taken as the acute psychological stressor. Results. SFP was negatively correlated with tensity and state anxiety. Emotional intelligence (EI) indirectly affected the SFP mediated by emotional state and workload, and emotional state had a mediating effect on the relationship between trait anxiety and SFP. Conclusions. The findings indicated that emotional trait factors (EI and trait anxiety) may indirectly affect SFP under an acute psychological stress situation, and emotional state (tensity and state anxiety) and mental workload played an important mediating role.", "As the range of potential uses for Artificial Intelligence (AI), in particular machine learning (ML), has increased, so has awareness of the associated ethical issues. This increased awareness has led to the realisation that existing legislation and regulation provides insufficient protection to individuals, groups, society, and the environment from AI harms. In response to this realisation, there has been a proliferation of principle-based ethics codes, guidelines and frameworks. However, it has become increasingly clear that a significant gap exists between the theory of AI ethics principles and the practical design of AI systems. In previous work, we analysed whether it is possible to close this gap between the 'what' and the 'how' of AI ethics through the use of tools and methods designed to help AI developers, engineers, and designers translate principles into practice. We concluded that this method of closure is currently ineffective as almost all existing translational tools and methods are either too flexible (and thus vulnerable to ethics washing) or too strict (unresponsive to context). This raised the question: if, even with technical guidance, AI ethics is challenging to embed in the process of algorithmic design, is the entire pro-ethical design endeavour rendered futile? And, if no, then how can AI ethics be made useful for AI practitioners? This is the question we seek to address here by exploring why principles and technical translational tools are still needed even if they are limited, and how these limitations can be potentially overcome by providing theoretical grounding of a concept that has been termed 'Ethics as a Service.'", "Purpose: The purpose of this article is to offer key recommendations based on the authors' experiences for utilizing pharmacy analytics to support moving beyond standard-of-practice operational metrics towards high impact reporting to drive day-to-day decisions for frontline leaders. Summary: There is a continuous and vast amount of data generated through all facets of a health system's daily operations, yet many data elements go unused and fail to contribute to value creation and increased performance at an organizational level. It is critical, therefore, for departments of pharmacy to identify and implement effective strategies to leverage data through robust business analytics and reporting, ensuring managers at every level are provided the information they need to support data-driven decisions and meaningful interventions in the day-to-day operations of the organization. At the authors' institution, development and growth of a dedicated Pharmacy Analytics (PA) team has been instrumental to the pharmacy department for generating value and proactively supporting a business intelligence strategy that focuses on a data-driven management culture. Key recommendations to leverage pharmacy analytics are provided within four overarching themes: building transparency, leveraging synergy, optimizing actionability, and prioritizing partnerships. Conclusion: Through creation of a data-driven management culture, the authors provide recommendations for leveraging pharmacy analytics to reduce costs and impact outcomes across a range of hospital pharmacy operations.", "In recent years, with the development of various high-throughput omics based biological technologies (BT), biomedical research began to enter the era of big data. In the face of high-dimensional, multi-domain and multi-modal biomedical big data, scientific research requires a new paradigm of data intensive scientific research. The vigorous development of cutting-edge information technologies (IT) such as cloud computing, blockchain and artificial intelligence provides technical means for the practice of this new research paradigm. Here,we describe the application of such cutting-edge information technologies in biomedical big data, and propose a forward-looking prospect for the construction of a new paradigm supporting environment for data intensive scientific research. We expect to establish a new research scheme and new scientific research paradigm integrating BT & IT technology, which can finally promote the great leap forward development of biomedical research.\n\u8fd1\u5e74\u6765,\u968f\u7740\u4ee5\u9ad8\u901a\u91cf\u7ec4\u5b66\u68c0\u6d4b\u6280\u672f\u4e3a\u4ee3\u8868\u7684\u751f\u7269\u6280\u672f(biological technology, BT)\u7684\u53d1\u5c55,\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u9886\u57df\u5f00\u59cb\u8fdb\u5165\u5927\u6570\u636e\u65f6\u4ee3\u3002\u9762\u5bf9\u9ad8\u7ef4\u5ea6\u3001\u8de8\u5c42\u6b21\u3001\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u5927\u6570\u636e,\u79d1\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u9700\u8981\u6570\u636e\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u79d1\u7814\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002\u4e91\u8ba1\u7b97\u3001\u533a\u5757\u94fe\u3001\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7b49\u524d\u6cbf\u4fe1\u606f\u6280\u672f(information technology, IT)\u7684\u84ec\u52c3\u53d1\u5c55\u4e3a\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u7814\u7a76\u8303\u5f0f\u7684\u5b9e\u8df5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6280\u672f\u624b\u6bb5\u3002\u672c\u6587\u5bf9\u4e91\u8ba1\u7b97\u3001\u533a\u5757\u94fe\u3001\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7b49\u524d\u6cbf\u4fe1\u606f\u6280\u672f\u5728\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u5927\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u63cf\u8ff0,\u5e76\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u79d1\u7814\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u652f\u6491\u73af\u5883\u7684\u6784\u5efa\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u524d\u77bb\u5c55\u671b,\u4ee5\u671f\u5efa\u7acb\u878d\u5408BT&IT \u6280\u672f\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u6848\u548c\u79d1\u7814\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f,\u6700\u7ec8\u63a8\u52a8\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u8de8\u8d8a\u5f0f\u53d1\u5c55\u3002.", "Metallurgy and material design have thousands of years' history and have played a critical role in the civilization process of humankind. The traditional trial-and-error method has been unprecedentedly challenged in the modern era when the number of components and phases in novel alloys keeps increasing, with high-entropy alloys as the representative. New opportunities emerge for alloy design in the artificial intelligence era. Here, a successful machine-learning (ML) method has been developed to identify the microstructure images with eye-challenging morphology for a number of martensitic and ferritic steels. Assisted by it, a new neural-network method is proposed for the inverse design of alloys with 20 components, which can accelerate the design process based on microstructure. The method is also readily applied to other material systems given sufficient microstructure images. This work lays the foundation for inverse alloy design based on microstructure images with extremely similar features.", "Sarcopenia is defined as muscle wasting, characterized by a progressive loss of muscle mass and function due to ageing. Diagnosis of sarcopenia typically involves both muscle imaging and the physical performance of people exhibiting signs of muscle weakness. Despite its worldwide prevalence, a molecular method for accurately diagnosing sarcopenia has not been established.\nWe develop an artificial intelligence (AI) diagnosis model of sarcopenia using a published transcriptome dataset comprising patients from multiple ethnicities. For the AI model for sarcopenia diagnosis, we use a transcriptome database comprising 17\u00a0339 genes from 118 subjects. Among the 17\u00a0339 genes, we select 27 features as the model inputs. For feature selection, we use a random forest, extreme gradient boosting and adaptive boosting. Using the top 27 features, we propose a four-layer deep neural network, named DSnet-v1, for sarcopenia diagnosis.\nAmong isolated testing datasets, DSnet-v1 provides high sensitivity (100%), specificity (94.12%), accuracy (95.83%), balanced accuracy (97.06%) and area under receiver operating characteristics (0.99). To extend the number of patient data, we develop a web application (http://sarcopeniaAI.ml/), where the model can be accessed unrestrictedly to diagnose sarcopenia if the transcriptome is available. A focused analysis of the top 27 genes for their differential or co-expression with other genes implied the potential existence of race-specific factors for sarcopenia, suggesting the possibility of identifying causal factors of sarcopenia when a more extended dataset is provided.\nOur new AI model, DSnet-v1, accurately diagnoses sarcopenia and is currently available publicly to assist healthcare providers in diagnosing and treating sarcopenia.", "Background: Ever since the seminal work by McCulloch and Pitts, the theory of neural computation and its philosophical foundation known as 'computationalism' have been central to brain-inspired artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. The present study describes neural dynamics and neural coding approaches to understand the mechanisms of neural computation. The primary focus is to characterize the multiscale nature of logic computations in the brain, which might occur at a single neuron level, between neighboring neurons via synaptic transmission, and at the neural circuit level. Results: For this, we begin the analysis with simple neuron models to account for basic Boolean logic operations at a single neuron level and then move on to the phenomenological neuron models to explain the neural computation from the viewpoints of neural dynamics and neural coding. The roles of synaptic transmission in neural computation are investigated using biologically realistic multi-compartment neuron models: two representative computational entities, CA1 pyramidal neuron in the hippocampus and Purkinje fiber in the cerebellum, are analyzed in the information-theoretic framework. We then construct two-dimensional mutual information maps, which demonstrate that the synaptic transmission can process not only basic AND/OR Boolean logic operations but also the linearly non-separable XOR function. Finally, we provide an overview of the evolutionary algorithm and discuss its benefits in automated neural circuit design for logic operations. Conclusions: This study provides a comprehensive perspective on the multiscale logic operations in the brain from both neural dynamics and neural coding viewpoints. It should thus be beneficial for understanding computational principles of the brain and may help design biologically plausible neuron models for AI devices.", "Stretchable and transparent electrodes (STEs) are indispensable components in numerous emerging applications such as optoelectrical devices and wearable devices used in health monitoring, human-machine interaction, and artificial intelligence. However, STEs have limitations in conductivity, robustness, and transmittance owing to the exposure of the substrate and fatigue deformation of nanomaterials under strain. In this study, an STE consisting of conductive materials embedded in in situ self-cracking strain-spread channels by wettability self-assembly is fabricated. Finite element analysis is used to simulate the crevice growth using the representative unit cell network and strain deformation using a random network. The embedded conductive materials are partly protected by the strain-opening crevice channel, and network dissociation is avoided under stretching, showing a maximum strain of 125%, a transmittance of approximately 89.66% (excluding the substrate) with a square resistance of 9.8 \u03a9 sq-1, and high stability in an environment with high temperature and moisture. The wettability self-assembly coating process is verified and expanded to several kinds of hydrophilic inks and hydrophobic coating materials. The fabricated STE can be employed as a strain sensor in motion sensing, vital sign and posture feedback, and mimicking bioelectronic spiderweb with spatial gravity induction.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) models are increasingly being developed for clinical chemistry applications, however, it is not understood whether human interaction with the models, which may occur once they are implemented, improves or worsens their performance. This study examined the effect of human supervision on an artificial neural network trained to identify wrong blood in tube (WBIT) errors.\nDe-identified patient data for current and previous (within seven days) electrolytes, urea and creatinine (EUC) results were used in the computer simulation of WBIT errors at a rate of 50%. Laboratory staff volunteers reviewed the AI model's predictions, and the EUC results on which they were based, before making a final decision regarding the presence or absence of a WBIT error. The performance of this approach was compared to the performance of the AI model operating without human supervision.\nLaboratory staff supervised the classification of 510 sets of EUC results. This workflow identified WBIT errors with an accuracy of 81.2%, sensitivity of 73.7% and specificity of 88.6%. However, the AI model classifying these samples autonomously was superior on all metrics (p-values<0.05), including accuracy (92.5%), sensitivity (90.6%) and specificity (94.5%).\nHuman interaction with AI models can significantly alter their performance. For computationally complex tasks such as WBIT error identification, best performance may be achieved by autonomously functioning AI models.", "Given the need for real time data to aid in decision-making at the community level, contact tracing applications (apps) are explored as a potential method of gauging overall community well-being. The context of contact tracing effectiveness and integration with artificial intelligence is provided, as well as ideas and suggestions for how to expand for use as a community-wide data gathering approach. This commentary seeks to explore dimensions around the use of such apps to help manage in times of crisis given the widespread and destructive impacts the pandemic has on community well-being, including negative economic impacts and social declines. By connecting with community well-being, the idea of a contact tracing framework would enable communities to track data and make decisions to help foster well-being across public health, economic and social domains.", "Diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) are a leading cause of disability and morbidity. There is an unmet need for a simple, practical, home method to detect DFUs early and remotely monitor their healing.\nWe developed a simple, inexpensive, smartphone-based, \"Foot Selfie\" system that enables patients to photograph the plantar surface of their feet without assistance and transmit images to a remote server. In a pilot study, patients from a limb-salvage clinic were asked to image their feet daily for six months and to evaluate the system by questionnaire at five time points. Transmitted results were reviewed weekly.\nFifteen patients (10 male) used the system after approximately 5 minutes of instruction. Participants uploaded images on a median of 76% of eligible study days. The system captured and transmitted diagnostic quality images of the entire plantar surface of both feet, permitting clinical-management decisions on a remote basis. We monitored 12 active wounds and 39 pre-ulcerative lesions (five wounds and 13 pre-ulcerative lesions at study outset); we observed healing of seven wounds and reversal of 20 pre-ulcerative lesions. Participants rated the system as useful, empowering, and preferable to their previous methods of foot screening.\nWith minimal training, patients transmitted diagnostic-quality images from home on most days, allowing clinicians to review serial images. This system permits inexpensive home foot screening and monitoring of DFUs. Further studies are needed to determine whether it can reduce morbidity of DFUs and/or the associated cost of care. Artificial intelligence integration could improve scalability.", "The diagnosis of solid tumors of epithelial origin (carcinomas) represents a major part of the workload in clinical histopathology. Carcinomas consist of malignant epithelial cells arranged in more or less cohesive clusters of variable size and shape, together with stromal cells, extracellular matrix, and blood vessels. Distinguishing stroma from epithelium is a critical component of artificial intelligence (AI) methods developed to detect and analyze carcinomas. In this paper, we propose a novel automated workflow that enables large-scale guidance of AI methods to identify the epithelial component. The workflow is based on re-staining existing hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded sections by immunohistochemistry for cytokeratins, cytoskeletal components specific to epithelial cells. Compared to existing methods, clinically available H&E sections are reused and no additional material, such as consecutive slides, is needed. We developed a simple and reliable method for automatic alignment to generate masks denoting cytokeratin-rich regions, using cell nuclei positions that are visible in both the original and the re-stained slide. The registration method has been compared to state-of-the-art methods for alignment of consecutive slides and shows that, despite being simpler, it provides similar accuracy and is more robust. We also demonstrate how the automatically generated masks can be used to train modern AI image segmentation based on U-Net, resulting in reliable detection of epithelial regions in previously unseen H&E slides. Through training on real-world material available in clinical laboratories, this approach therefore has widespread applications toward achieving AI-assisted tumor assessment directly from scanned H&E sections. In addition, the re-staining method will facilitate additional automated quantitative studies of tumor cell and stromal cell phenotypes.", "Introduction: Digital technologies, including text messaging and mobile phone apps, can be leveraged to increase people's physical activity and manage health. Chatbots, powered by artificial intelligence, can automatically interact with individuals through natural conversation. They may be more engaging than one-way messaging interventions. To our knowledge, physical activity chatbots have not been developed with low-income participants, nor in Spanish-the second most dominant language in the U.S. We recommend best practices for physical activity chatbots in English and Spanish for low-income women. Methods: We designed a prototype physical activity text-message based conversational agent based on various psychotherapeutic techniques. We recruited participants through SNAP-Ed (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program Education) in California (Alameda County) and Tennessee (Shelby County). We conducted qualitative interviews with participants during testing of our prototype chatbot, held a Wizard of Oz study, and facilitated a co-design workshop in Spanish with a subset of our participants. Results: We included 10 Spanish- and 8 English-speaking women between 27 and 41 years old. The majority was Hispanic/Latina (n = 14), 2 were White and 2 were Black/African American. More than half were monolingual Spanish speakers, and the majority was born outside the US (>50% in Mexico). Most participants were unfamiliar with chatbots and were initially skeptical. After testing our prototype, most users felt positively about health chatbots. They desired a personalized chatbot that addresses their concerns about privacy, and stressed the need for a comprehensive system to also aid with nutrition, health information, stress, and involve family members. Differences between English and monolingual Spanish speakers were found mostly in exercise app use, digital literacy, and the wish for family inclusion. Conclusion: Low-income Spanish- and English-speaking women are interested in using chatbots to improve their physical activity and other health related aspects. Researchers developing health chatbots for this population should focus on issues of digital literacy, app familiarity, linguistic and cultural issues, privacy concerns, and personalization. Designing and testing this intervention for and with this group using co-creation techniques and involving community partners will increase the probability that it will ultimately be effective.", "The Gleason grading system has been the most reliable tool for the prognosis of prostate cancer since its development. However, its clinical application remains limited by interobserver variability in grading and quantification, which has negative consequences for risk assessment and clinical management of prostate cancer.\nTo examine the impact of an artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted approach to prostate cancer grading and quantification.\nThis diagnostic study was conducted at the University of Wisconsin-Madison from August 2, 2017, to December 30, 2019. The study chronologically selected 589 men with biopsy-confirmed prostate cancer who received care in the University of Wisconsin Health System between January 1, 2005, and February 28, 2017. A total of 1000 biopsy slides (1 or 2 slides per patient) were selected and scanned to create digital whole-slide images, which were used to develop and validate a deep convolutional neural network-based AI-powered platform. The whole-slide images were divided into a training set (n\u2009=\u2009838) and validation set (n\u2009=\u2009162). Three experienced academic urological pathologists (W.H., K.A.I., and R.H., hereinafter referred to as pathologists 1, 2, and 3, respectively) were involved in the validation. Data were collected between December 29, 2018, and December 20, 2019, and analyzed from January 4, 2020, to March 1, 2021.\nAccuracy of prostate cancer detection by the AI-powered platform and comparison of prostate cancer grading and quantification performed by the 3 pathologists using manual vs AI-assisted methods.\nAmong 589 men with biopsy slides, the mean (SD) age was 63.8 (8.2) years, the mean (SD) prebiopsy prostate-specific antigen level was 10.2 (16.2) ng/mL, and the mean (SD) total cancer volume was 15.4% (20.1%). The AI system was able to distinguish prostate cancer from benign prostatic epithelium and stroma with high accuracy at the patch-pixel level, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.92 (95% CI, 0.88-0.95). The AI system achieved almost perfect agreement with the training pathologist (pathologist 1) in detecting prostate cancer at the patch-pixel level (weighted \u03ba\u2009=\u20090.97; asymptotic 95% CI, 0.96-0.98) and in grading prostate cancer at the slide level (weighted \u03ba\u2009=\u20090.98; asymptotic 95% CI, 0.96-1.00). Use of the AI-assisted method was associated with significant improvements in the concordance of prostate cancer grading and quantification between the 3 pathologists (eg, pathologists 1 and 2: 90.1% agreement using AI-assisted method vs 84.0% agreement using manual method; P\u2009<\u2009.001) and significantly higher weighted \u03ba values for all pathologists (eg, pathologists 2 and 3: weighted \u03ba\u2009=\u20090.92 [asymptotic 95% CI, 0.90-0.94] for AI-assisted method vs 0.76 [asymptotic 95% CI, 0.71-0.80] for manual method; P\u2009<\u2009.001) compared with the manual method.\nIn this diagnostic study, an AI-powered platform was able to detect, grade, and quantify prostate cancer with high accuracy and efficiency and was associated with significant reductions in interobserver variability. These results suggest that an AI-powered platform could potentially transform histopathological evaluation and improve risk stratification and clinical management of prostate cancer.", "The current study was a replication and comparison of our previous research which examined the comprehension accuracy of popular intelligent virtual assistants, including Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, and Apple Siri for recognizing the generic and brand names of the top 50 most dispensed medications in the United States. Using the exact same voice recordings from 2019, audio clips of 46 participants were played back to each device in 2021. Google Assistant achieved the highest comprehension accuracy for both brand medication names (86.0%) and generic medication names (84.3%), followed by Apple Siri (brand names = 78.4%, generic names = 75.0%), and the lowest accuracy by Amazon Alexa (brand names 64.2%, generic names = 66.7%). These findings represent the same trend of results as our previous research, but reveal significant increases of ~10-24% in performance for Amazon Alexa and Apple Siri over the past 2 years. This indicates that the artificial intelligence software algorithms have improved to better recognize the speech characteristics of complex medication names, which has important implications for telemedicine and digital healthcare services.", "The study aimed to evaluate the long-term neurological sequelae and the disease burden of JE in Gansu, China.\nJE patients were included as study population from 2005-2011 in Gansu, and a follow-up survey was conducted in 2007-2014. Pair-matched healthy individuals were selected as controls. All subjects underwent a neurological examination and intelligence quotient (IQ) and memory quotient (MQ) assessments. Then, the disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), and direct and indirect medical expenses were systematic assessed.\nForty-four point seven percent of the JE patients had objective neurological deficits, compared with 2.4% of controls. Subnormal intelligence was found in 21.2% of JE subjects, compared with 1.2% control who exhibited a mildly reduced IQ. Abnormal MQ scores were noted in 56.3% JE subjects, compared with only 12.7% controls. Prevalence of each sequelae caused by JE were significantly higher in adults than in younger subjects. Furthermore, median DALY lost due to JE was 9.2 per subject. Median economic cost of JE was approximately $2776.6 per subject and significantly higher in adults than in younger subjects.\nJE patients suffered from severe neurological sequelae and high disease burden, resulting in a significant downstream burden for both the patients (especially adults) and the healthcare system.", "The identification of different meat cuts for labeling and quality control on production lines is still largely a manual process. As a result, it is a labor-intensive exercise with the potential for not only error but also bacterial cross-contamination. Artificial intelligence is used in many disciplines to identify objects within images, but these approaches usually require a considerable volume of images for training and validation. The objective of this study was to identify five different meat cuts from images and weights collected by a trained operator within the working environment of a commercial Irish beef plant. Individual cut images and weights from 7,987 meats cuts extracted from semimembranosus muscles (i.e., Topside muscle), post editing, were available. A variety of classical neural networks and a novel Ensemble machine learning approaches were then tasked with identifying each individual meat cut; performance of the approaches was dictated by accuracy (the percentage of correct predictions), precision (the ratio of correctly predicted objects relative to the number of objects identified as positive), and recall (also known as true positive rate or sensitivity). A novel Ensemble approach outperformed a selection of the classical neural networks including convolutional neural network and residual network. The accuracy, precision, and recall for the novel Ensemble method were 99.13%, 99.00%, and 98.00%, respectively, while that of the next best method were 98.00%, 98.00%, and 95.00%, respectively. The Ensemble approach, which requires relatively few gold-standard measures, can readily be deployed under normal abattoir conditions; the strategy could also be evaluated in the cuts from other primals or indeed other species.", "Background: Artificial Intelligence (AI) in healthcare has demonstrated high efficiency in academic research, while only few, and predominantly small, real-world AI applications exist in the preventive, diagnostic and therapeutic contexts. Our identification and analysis of success factors for the implementation of AI aims to close the gap between recent years' significant academic AI advancements and the comparably low level of practical application in healthcare. Methods: A literature and real life cases analysis was conducted in Scopus and OpacPlus as well as the Google advanced search database. The according search queries have been defined based on success factor categories for AI implementation derived from a prior World Health Organization survey about barriers of adoption of Big Data within 125 countries. The eligible publications and real life cases were identified through a catalog of in- and exclusion criteria focused on concrete AI application cases. These were then analyzed to deduct and discuss success factors that facilitate or inhibit a broad-scale implementation of AI in healthcare. Results: The analysis revealed three categories of success factors, namely (1) policy setting, (2) technological implementation, and (3) medical and economic impact measurement. For each of them a set of recommendations has been deducted: First, a risk adjusted policy frame is required that distinguishes between precautionary and permissionless principles, and differentiates among accountability, liability, and culpability. Second, a \"privacy by design\" centered technology infrastructure shall be applied that enables practical and legally compliant data access. Third, the medical and economic impact need to be quantified, e.g., through the measurement of quality-adjusted life years while applying the CHEERS and PRISMA reporting criteria. Conclusions: Private and public institutions can already today leverage AI implementation based on the identified results and thus drive the translation from scientific development to real world application. Additional success factors could include trust-building measures, data categorization guidelines, and risk level assessments and as the success factors are interlinked, future research should elaborate on their optimal interaction to utilize the full potential of AI in real world application.", "An HERB-Drug Interaction (HDI) database is a structured data collection method for HDI information extracted from scattered literatures for quick retrieval. Our review summarized the ten currently available HDI databases, including those databases comprising HDI on the market. A detailed comparison on the scope of monographs, including the nature of content extracted from the original literature and user interfaces of these databases, was performed, and the number of references of fifty popular herbs in each HDI database was counted and presented in a heatmap to give users an intuitive understanding of the focuses of different HDI databases. Since it is well known that the development and maintenance of databases need continuous investment of capital and manpower, the sustainability of these databases was also reviewed and compared. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, especially Natural Language Processing (NLP), have been applied to screen specific topics from massive articles and automatically identify the names of drugs and herbs in the literature. However, its application on the labor-intensive extraction and evaluation of HDI-related experimental conditions and results from literature remains limited due to the scarcity of these HDI data and the lack of well-established annotated datasets for these specific NLP recognition tasks. In view of the difficulties faced by current HDI databases and potential expansion of AI application in HDI database development, we propose a standardized format for data reporting and use of Concept Unique Identifier (CUI) for medical terms in the literature to accelerate the structured data collection. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The worldwide popularity of botanical and/or traditional medicine products has raised safety concerns due to potential HDI. However, the publicly available HDI databases are mostly outdated or incomplete. Through our review of the currently available HDI databases, a clear understanding of the key issues could be obtained and possible solutions to overcome the labour-intensive extraction as well as professional evaluation of information in HDI database development are proposed.", "With the rising amount of data in the sports and health sectors, a plethora of applications using big data mining have become possible. Multiple frameworks have been proposed to mine, store, preprocess, and analyze physiological vitals data using artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms. Comparatively, less research has been done to collect potentially high volume, high-quality 'big data' in an organized, time-synchronized, and holistic manner to solve similar problems in multiple fields. Although a large number of data collection devices exist in the form of sensors. They are either highly specialized, univariate and fragmented\u00a0in nature or exist in a lab setting. The current study aims to propose artificial intelligence-based body sensor network framework (AIBSNF), a framework for strategic use of body sensor networks (BSN), which combines with real-time location system (RTLS) and wearable biosensors to collect multivariate, low noise, and high-fidelity data. This facilitates gathering of time-synchronized location and physiological vitals data, which allows artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML)-based time series analysis. The study gives a brief overview of wearable sensor technology, RTLS, and provides use cases of AI/ML algorithms in the field of sensor fusion. The study also elaborates sample scenarios using a specific sensor network consisting of pressure sensors (insoles), accelerometers, gyroscopes, ECG, EMG, and RTLS position detectors for particular applications in the field of health care and sports. The AIBSNF may provide a solid blueprint for conducting research and development, forming a smooth end-to-end pipeline from data collection using BSN, RTLS and final stage analytics based on AI/ML algorithms.", "Under the current situation of the rapid development of brain-like artificial intelligence and the increasingly complex electromagnetic environment, the most bionic and anti-interference spiking neural network has shown great potential in computing speed, real-time information processing, and spatiotemporal data processing. Spiking neural network is the core part of brain-like artificial intelligence, which realizes brain-like computing by simulating the structure of biological neural network and the way of information transmission. This article first summarizes the advantages and disadvantages of the five models, and analyzes the characteristics of several network topologies. Then, it summarizes the spiking neural network algorithms. The unsupervised learning based on spike timing dependent plasticity (STDP) rules and four types of supervised learning algorithms are analyzed. Finally, the research on brain-like neuromorphic chips at home and abroad are reviewed. This paper aims to provide learning ideas and research directions for new colleagues in the field of spiking neural network.\n\u5728\u7c7b\u8111\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u9ad8\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\u3001\u7535\u78c1\u73af\u5883\u65e5\u76ca\u590d\u6742\u7684\u73b0\u72b6\u4e0b\uff0c\u6700\u5177\u6709\u4eff\u751f\u7279\u6027\u548c\u6297\u5e72\u6270\u6027\u7684\u8109\u51b2\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u901f\u5ea6\u3001\u5b9e\u65f6\u4fe1\u606f\u5904\u7406\u3001\u65f6\u7a7a\u6570\u636e\u5904\u7406\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5de8\u5927\u7684\u6f5c\u80fd\u3002\u8109\u51b2\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u662f\u7c7b\u8111\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u4e4b\u4e00\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u751f\u7269\u4f53\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u4f20\u9012\u65b9\u5f0f\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u7c7b\u8111\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002\u672c\u6587\u9996\u5148\u603b\u7ed3\u4e94\u79cd\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4f18\u7f3a\u70b9\u548c\u9002\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e94\u79cd\u7f51\u7edc\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u7279\u5f81\uff1b\u5176\u6b21\u7efc\u8ff0\u8109\u51b2\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ece\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u6709\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u4e24\u4e2a\u89d2\u5ea6\u603b\u7ed3\u57fa\u4e8e\u7a81\u89e6\u53ef\u5851\u6027\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u56db\u7c7b\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1b\u6700\u540e\u91cd\u70b9\u7efc\u8ff0\u56fd\u5185\u5916\u5728\u7814\u7684\u7c7b\u8111\u795e\u7ecf\u5f62\u6001\u82af\u7247\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7684\u603b\u7ed3\uff0c\u4e3a\u521d\u5165\u8109\u51b2\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7814\u7a76\u9886\u57df\u7684\u540c\u884c\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b66\u4e60\u601d\u8def\u548c\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u3002.", "Dyslexia involves extreme difficulty with reading, writing, and spelling in your native language despite at least average intelligence. Health literacy refers to the ability to read, understand, and use health information to make appropriate health decisions. Dyslexia is rarely mentioned as a contributing factor to health literacy. Medical providers should be more aware of the special needs of dyslexic patients and implement interventions to allow them to successfully navigate the healthcare environment.", "Throughout the history of biological/medicine sciences, there has been opposing strategies to find solutions to complex human disease problems. Both empirical and deductive approaches have led to major insights and concepts that have led to practical preventive and therapeutic benefits for the human population. The classic definitions of \"science\" (to know) has been paired with the classic definition of technology (to do). One knew more as the technology developed, and that development was often based on science. In other words, one could do more if science could improve the technology. In turn, this made possible to know more science with improved technology. However, with the development of new technologies of today in biology and medicine, major advances have been made, such as the information from the Human Genome Project, genetic engineering techniques and the use of bioinformatic uses of sophisticated computer analyses. This has led to the renewed idea that Precision Medicine, while raising some serious ethical concerns, also raises the expectation of improved potential of risk predictions for prevention and treatment of various genetically and environmentally influenced human diseases. This new field Artificial Intelligence, as a major handmaiden to Precision Medicine, is significantly altering the fundamental means of biological discovery. However, can today's fundamental premise of \"Artificial Intelligence\", based on identifying DNA, as the primary nexus of human health and disease, provide the practical solutions to complex human diseases that involve the interaction of those genes with the broad spectrum of \"environmental factors\"? Will it be \"precise\" enough to provide practical solutions for prevention and treatments of diseases? In this \"Commentary\", with the example of human carcinogenesis, it will be challenged that, without the integration of mechanistic and hypothesis-driven approaches with the \"unbiased\" empirical analyses of large numbers of data, the Artificial Intelligence approach with fall short.", "Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has been identified as a viable method for determining the importance of features when making predictions using Machine Learning (ML) models. In this study, we created models that take an individual's health information (e.g. their drug history and comorbidities) as inputs, and predict the probability that the individual will have an Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) adverse outcome.\nUsing XAI, we quantified the contribution that specific drugs had on these ACS predictions, thus creating an XAI-based technique for pharmacovigilance monitoring, using ACS as an example of the adverse outcome to detect. Individuals aged over 65 who were supplied Musculo-skeletal system (anatomical therapeutic chemical (ATC) class M) or Cardiovascular system (ATC class C) drugs between 1993 and 2009 were identified, and their drug histories, comorbidities, and other key features were extracted from linked Western Australian datasets. Multiple ML models were trained to predict if these individuals would have an ACS related adverse outcome (i.e., death or hospitalisation with a discharge diagnosis of ACS), and a variety of ML and XAI techniques were used to calculate which features - specifically which drugs - led to these predictions.\nThe drug dispensing features for rofecoxib and celecoxib were found to have a greater than zero contribution to ACS related adverse outcome predictions (on average), and it was found that ACS related adverse outcomes can be predicted with 72% accuracy. Furthermore, the XAI libraries LIME and SHAP were found to successfully identify both important and unimportant features, with SHAP slightly outperforming LIME.\nML models trained on linked administrative health datasets in tandem with XAI algorithms can successfully quantify feature importance, and with further development, could potentially be used as pharmacovigilance monitoring techniques.", "The evolution of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has revolutionized many aspects of human life, including healthcare. Amidst the Covid-19 pandemic, AI-enabled smartwatches are being used to help users to self-monitor and self-manage their health. Using a framework based on Stimulus-Organism-Response (S-O-R) theory, this present study aimed to explore the use of AI-enabled smartwatches for health purposes, in particular the effects of product quality, service quality, perceived convenience, and perceived ease of use on user experience, trust and user satisfaction. Based on a purposive survey sample of 486 smartphone users in Bangladesh, data collected was analyzed using SPSS software for elementary analyses and PLS-SEM for hypotheses testing. The findings showed that the predictors, namely product quality, service quality, perceived convenience, and perceived ease of use, significantly affected user experience and trust. Similarly, user experience and trust were influential on user satisfaction and played partial mediating roles between predictors and user satisfaction. Besides, gender and age moderate the relationships of experience and trust with customer satisfaction. These findings support the S-O-R theoretical framework and have practical implications for brand and marketing managers of smartwatches in developing product features and understanding users' attitudes and behaviours.", "Purpose: The intent of this article is to evaluate a novel approach, using rapid cycle analytics and real world evidence, to optimize and improve the medication evaluation process to help the formulary decision making process, while reducing time for clinicians. Summary: The Pharmacy and Therapeutics (P&T) Committee within each health system is responsible for evaluating medication requests for formulary addition. Members of the pharmacy staff prepare the drug monograph or a medication use evaluation (MUE) and allocate precious clinical resources to review patient charts to assess efficacy and value. We explored a novel approach to evaluate the value of our intravenous acetaminophen (IV APAP) formulary admittance. This new methodology, called rapid cycle analytics, can assist hospitals in meeting and/or exceeding the minimum criteria of formulary maintenance as defined by the Joint Commission Standards. In this particular study, we assessed the effectiveness of IV APAP in total hip arthroplasty (THA) and total knee arthroplasty (TKA) procedures. We assessed the correlation to same-stay opioid utilization, average length of inpatient stay and post anesthesia care unit (PACU) time. Conclusion: We were able to explore and improve our organization's approach in evaluating medications by partnering with an external analytics expert to help organize and normalize our data in a more robust, yet time efficient manner. Additionally, we were able to use a significantly larger external data set as a point of reference. Being able to perform this detailed analytical exercise for thousands of encounters internally and using a data warehouse of over 130 million patients as a point of reference in a short time has improved the depth of our assessment, as well as reducing valuable clinical resources allocated to MUEs to allow for more direct patient care. This clinically real-world and data-rich analytics model is the necessary foundation for using Artificial or Augmented Intelligence (AI) to make real-time formulary and drug selection decisions.", "Psychotic disorders typically manifest from late adolescence to early adulthood, and an earlier onset might be associated with greater symptom severity and a worse long-term prognosis. This study aimed to compare the cognitive characteristics of patients with first-episode psychosis (FEP) by their age at onset. We included 298 patients diagnosed with FEP and classified them as having an early onset (EOS), youth onset (YOS), or adult onset (AOS) based on age limits of\u2009\u2264\u200918\u00a0years (N\u2009=\u200961), 19-24\u00a0years (N\u2009=\u2009121), and\u2009\u2265\u200925\u00a0years (N\u2009=\u2009116), respectively. Socio-demographic and clinical variables included age at baseline, gender, socio-economic status, antipsychotic medication, DSM-IV diagnoses assessed by clinical semi-structured interview, psychotic symptom severity, and age at onset. Neuropsychological assessment included six cognitive domains: premorbid intelligence, working memory, processing speed, verbal memory, sustained attention, and executive functioning. The EOS group had lower scores than the YOS or AOS groups in global cognition, executive functioning, and sustained attention. Although the scores in the YOS group were intermediate to those in the EOS and AOS groups for most cognitive factors, no statistically significant differences were detected between the YOS and AOS groups. Age at onset results in specific patterns of cognitive interference. Of note, impairment appears to be greater with EOS samples than with either YOS or AOS samples. A longitudinal study with a larger sample size is needed to confirm our findings.", "Basic scientists and drug developers are accelerating innovations toward the goal of precision medicine. Regulators create pathways for timely patient access to precision medicines, including individualized therapies. Healthcare payors acknowledge the need for change but downstream innovation for coverage and reimbursement is only haltingly occurring. Performance uncertainty, high price-tags, payment timing, and actuarial risk issues associated with precision medicines present novel financial challenges for payors. With traditional drug reimbursement frameworks, payment is based on an assumed randomized controlled trial (RCT) projection of real-world effectiveness, a \"trial-and-project\" strategy; the clinical benefit realized for patients is not usually ascertained ex post by collection of real-world data (RWD). To mitigate financial risks resulting from clinical performance uncertainty, manufacturers and payors devised \"track-and-pay\" frameworks (i.e., the tracking of a pre-agreed treatment outcome which is linked to financial consequences). Whereas some track-and-pay arrangements have been successful, inherent weaknesses include the potential for misalignment of incentives, the risk of channeling of patients, and a failure to use the RWD generated to enable continuous learning about treatments. \"Precision reimbursement\" (PR) intends to overcome inherent weaknesses of simple track-and-pay schemes. In combining the collection of RWD with advanced analytics (e.g., artificial intelligence and machine learning) to generate actionable real-world evidence, with prospective alignment of incentives across all stakeholders (including providers and patients), and with pre-agreed use and dissemination of information generated, PR becomes a \"learn-and-predict\" model of payment for performance. We here describe in detail the concept of PR and lay out the next steps to make it a reality.", "Sensors are essential in the haptic technology of soft robotics, which includes the technology of humanoids. Haptic sensors can be simulated by the mimetic organ of perceptual cells in the human body. However, there has been little research on the morphological fabrication of cutaneous receptors embedded in a human skin tissue utilizing artificial materials. In the present study, we fabricated artificial, cell-like cutaneous receptors embedded in skin tissue mimicking human skin structure by utilizing rubber. We addressed the fabrication of five cutaneous receptors (free nerve endings, Krause and bulbs, Meissner corpuscles, Pacinian corpuscles and Ruffini endings). In addition, we investigated the effectiveness of the fabricated tissue for mechanical and thermal sensing. At first, in the production of integrated artificial skin tissue, we proposed a novel magnetic, responsive, intelligent, hybrid fluid (HF), which is suitable for developing the hybrid rubber skin. Secondly, we presented the fabrication by utilizing not only the HF rubber but our previously proposed rubber vulcanization and adhesion techniques with electrolytic polymerization. Thirdly, we conducted a mechanical and thermal sensing touch experiment with the finger. As a result, it demonstrated that intelligence as a mechanoreceptor or thermoreceptor depends on its fabric: the HF rubber sensor mimicked Krause and bulbs has the thermal and pressing sensibility, and the one mimicked Ruffini endings the shearing sensibility.", "Self-tracking technologies aim to offer a better understanding of ourselves through data, create self-awareness, and facilitate healthy behavior change. Despite such promising objectives, very little is known about whether the implicit beliefs users may have about the changeability of their own behavior influence the way they experience self-tracking. These implicit beliefs about the permanence of the abilities are called mindsets; someone with a fixed mindset typically perceives human qualities (e.g., intelligence) as fixed, while someone with a growth mindset perceives them as amenable to change and improvement through learning. This paper investigates the concept of mindset in the context of self-tracking and uses online survey data from individuals wearing a self-tracking device (n = 290) to explore the ways in which users with different mindsets experience self-tracking. A combination of qualitative and quantitative approaches indicates that implicit beliefs about the changeability of behavior influence the extent to which users are self-determined toward self-tracking use. Moreover, differences were found in how users perceive and respond to failure, and how self-judgmental vs. self-compassionate they are toward their own mistakes. Overall, considering that how users respond to the self-tracking data is one of the core dimensions of self-tracking, our results suggest that mindset is one of the important determinants in shaping the self-tracking experience. This paper concludes by presenting design considerations and directions for future research.", "To assess the potential of a transfer learning strategy leveraging radiologist supervision to enhance convolutional neural network-based (CNN) localization of pneumonia on radiographs and to further assess the prognostic value of CNN severity quantification on patients evaluated for COVID-19 pneumonia, for whom severity on the presenting radiograph is a known predictor of mortality and intubation.\nWe obtained an initial CNN previously trained to localize pneumonia along with 25,684 radiographs used for its training. We additionally curated 1466 radiographs from patients who had a computed tomography (CT) performed on the same day. Regional likelihoods of pneumonia were then annotated by cardiothoracic radiologists, referencing these CTs. Combining data, a preexisting CNN was fine-tuned using transfer learning. Whole-image and regional performance of the updated CNN was assessed using receiver-operating characteristic area under the curve and Dice. Finally, the value of CNN measurements was assessed with survival analysis on 203 patients with COVID-19 and compared against modified radiographic assessment of lung edema (mRALE) score.\nPneumonia detection area under the curve improved on both internal (0.756 to 0.841) and external (0.864 to 0.876) validation data. Dice overlap also improved, particularly in the lung bases (R: 0.121 to 0.433, L: 0.111 to 0.486). There was strong correlation between radiologist mRALE score and CNN fractional area of involvement (\u03c1=0.85). Survival analysis showed similar, strong prognostic ability of the CNN and mRALE for mortality, likelihood of intubation, and duration of hospitalization among patients with COVID-19.\nRadiologist-supervised transfer learning can enhance the ability of CNNs to localize and quantify the severity of disease. Closed-loop systems incorporating radiologists may be beneficial for continued improvement of artificial intelligence algorithms.", "Despite the extensive published literature on the significant potential of artificial intelligence (AI) there are no reports on its efficacy in improving patient safety in robot-assisted surgery (RAS). The purposes of this work are to systematically review the published literature on AI in RAS, and to identify and discuss current limitations and challenges.\nA literature search was conducted on PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and IEEExplore according to PRISMA 2020 statement. Eligible articles were peer-review studies published in English language from January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2020. Amstar 2 was used for quality assessment. Risk of bias was evaluated with the Newcastle Ottawa Quality assessment tool. Data of the studies were visually presented in tables using SPIDER tool.\nThirty-five publications, representing 3436 patients, met the search criteria and were included in the analysis. The selected reports concern: motion analysis (n\u00a0=\u00a017), urology (n\u00a0=\u00a012), gynecology (n\u00a0=\u00a01), other specialties (n\u00a0=\u00a01), training (n\u00a0=\u00a03), and tissue retraction (n\u00a0=\u00a01). Precision for surgical tools detection varied from 76.0% to 90.6%. Mean absolute error on prediction of urinary continence after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) ranged from 85.9 to 134.7 days. Accuracy on prediction of length of stay after RARP was 88.5%. Accuracy on recognition of the next surgical task during robot-assisted partial nephrectomy (RAPN) achieved 75.7%.\nThe reviewed studies were of low quality. The findings are limited by the small size of the datasets. Comparison between studies on the same topic was restricted due to algorithms and datasets heterogeneity. There is no proof that currently AI can identify the critical tasks of RAS operations, which determine patient outcome. There is an urgent need for studies on large datasets and external validation of the AI algorithms used. Furthermore, the results should be transparent and meaningful to surgeons, enabling them to inform patients in layman's words.\nReview Registry Unique Identifying Number: reviewregistry1225.", "To analyze the clinical manifestations, genetic features and therapeutic efficacy of patients with Noonan syndrome (NS).

We provide validity evidence based on internal structure and on relationships with positive psychological variables and other variables indicative of psychological adjustment.\nParticipants were 222 Spanish women with a diagnosis of breast cancer. They completed the SWLS and a battery of questionnaires measuring positive and negative affect, self-esteem, resilience, emotional intelligence, flourishing, optimism, depression, anxiety, and stress.\nConfirmatory factor analysis supported a single-factor structure for the SWLS, S-B \u03c72 (5)\u00a0=\u00a07.36, p\u00a0=\u00a0.19, CFI\u00a0=\u00a0.99, NNFI\u00a0=\u00a0.99, RMSEA\u00a0=\u00a0.046. The reliability of test scores estimated with McDonald's omega yielded a value of .80. Validity evidence was provided by a positive correlation between SWLS scores and positive affect, self-esteem, resilience, emotional intelligence (specifically, clarity and repair), flourishing, and optimism (range: .24, .69), and by a negative correlation with negative affect, pessimism, depression, anxiety, and stress (range: -.25, -.59).\nThe Spanish version of the SWLS showed satisfactory psychometric properties and it is an appropriate measure for use in the breast cancer context.\nEl objetivo deestudio es examinar las propiedades psicom\u00e9tricas de la Escala de Satisfacci\u00f3n con la Vida (SWLS), analizando la fiabilidad de sus puntuaciones y aportando evidencias para su uso en pacientes con c\u00e1ncer de mama.

We searched several databases from the start of the Pandemic in December 2019 until 10th June 2021.\nA total of 28 publications was included in the review. The challenges cited in the included studies have been categorised into four distinct but interconnected themes including: upstream, Evidence synthesis, downstream and contextual challenges. These challenges have been further refined into issues with primary studies, databases, team capacity, process, resources, and context. Several proposals to improve the above challenges included: transparency in primary studies registration and reporting, establishment of online platforms that enables collaboration, data sharing and searching, the use of computable evidence and coordination of efforts at an international level.\nThis review has highlighted the importance of including artificial intelligence, a framework for international collaboration and a sustained funding model to address many of the shortcomings and ensure we are ready for similar challenges in the future.", "The authors evaluate the extent to which a user's impression of an AI agent can be improved by giving the agent the ability of self-estimation, thinking time, and coordination of risk tendency. The authors modified the algorithm of an AI agent in the cooperative game Hanabi to have all of these traits, and investigated the change in the user's impression by playing with the user. The authors used a self-estimation task to evaluate the effect that the ability to read the intention of a user had on an impression. The authors also show thinking time of an agent influences impression for an agent. The authors also investigated the relationship between the concordance of the risk-taking tendencies of players and agents, the player's impression of agents, and the game experience. The results of the self-estimation task experiment showed that the more accurate the estimation of the agent's self, the more likely it is that the partner will perceive humanity, affinity, intelligence, and communication skills in the agent. The authors also found that an agent that changes the length of thinking time according to the priority of action gives the impression that it is smarter than an agent with a normal thinking time when the player notices the difference in thinking time or an agent that randomly changes the thinking time. The result of the experiment regarding concordance of the risk-taking tendency shows that influence player's impression toward agents. These results suggest that game agent designers can improve the player's disposition toward an agent and the game experience by adjusting the agent's self-estimation level, thinking time, and risk-taking tendency according to the player's personality and inner state during the game.", "The evidence of the impact of traditional statistical (TS) and artificial intelligence (AI) tool interventions in clinical practice was limited. This study aimed to investigate the clinical impact and quality of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving interventions evaluating TS, machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) prediction tools. A systematic review on PubMed was conducted to identify RCTs involving TS/ML/DL tool interventions in the past decade. A total of 65 RCTs from 26,082 records were included. A majority of them had model development studies and generally good performance was achieved. The function of TS and ML tools in the RCTs mainly included assistive treatment decisions, assistive diagnosis, and risk stratification, but DL trials were only conducted for assistive diagnosis. Nearly two-fifths of the trial interventions showed no clinical benefit compared to standard care. Though DL and ML interventions achieved higher rates of positive results than TS in the RCTs, in trials with low risk of bias (17/65) the advantage of DL to TS was reduced while the advantage of ML to TS disappeared. The current applications of DL were not yet fully spread performed in medicine. It is predictable that DL will integrate more complex clinical problems than ML and TS tools in the future. Therefore, rigorous studies are required before the clinical application of these tools.", "The burden of diabetes mellitus (DM) and diabetic retinopathy (DR) is at alarming proportions in India and around the globe. The number of people with DM in India is estimated to increase to over 134 million by 2045. Screening and early identification of sight-threatening DR are proven ways of reducing DR-related blindness. An ideal DR screening model should include personalized awareness, targeted screening, integrated follow-up reminders, and capacity building. The DR screening technology is slowly shifting from direct examination by an ophthalmologist to remote screening using retinal photographs, including telescreening and automated grading of retinal images using artificial intelligence. The ophthalmologist-to-patient ratio is poor in India, and there is an urban-rural divide. The possibility of screening all people with diabetes by ophthalmologists alone is a remote possibility. It is prudent to use the available nonophthalmologist workforce for DR screening in tandem with the technological advances. Capacity-building efforts are based on the principle of task sharing, which allows for the training of a variety of nonophthalmologists in DR screening techniques and technology. The nonophthalmologist human resources for health include physicians, optometrists, allied ophthalmic personnel, nurses, and pharmacists, among others. A concurrent augmentation of health infrastructure, conducive health policy, improved advocacy, and increased people's participation are necessary requirements for successful DR screening. This perspective looks at the characteristics of various nonophthalmologist DR screening models and their applicability in addressing DR-related blindness in India.", "Due to recent developments in artificial intelligence, deep learning, and smart-device-technology, diagnostic software may be developed which can be executed offline as an app on smartphones using their high-resolution cameras and increasing processing power to directly analyse photos taken on the device.\nA software tool was developed to aid in the diagnosis of equine ophthalmic diseases, especially uveitis.\nProspective comparison of software and clinical diagnoses.\nA deep learning approach for image classification was used to train software by analysing photographs of equine eyes to make a statement on whether the horse was displaying signs of uveitis or other ophthalmic diseases. Four basis networks of different sizes (MobileNetV2, InceptionV3, VGG16, VGG19) with modified top-layers were evaluated. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) were trained on 2346 pictures of equine eyes, which were augmented to 9384 images. 261 separate unmodified images were used to evaluate the performance of the trained network.\nCross validation showed accuracy of 99.82% on training data and 96.66% on validation data when distinguishing between three categories (uveitis, other ophthalmic diseases, healthy).\nOne source of selection bias for the artificial intelligence presumably was the increased pupil size, which was mainly present in horses with ophthalmic diseases due to the use of mydriatics, and was not homogeneously dispersed in all categories of the dataset.\nOur system for detection of equine uveitis is unique and novel and can differentiate between uveitis and other equine ophthalmic diseases. Its development also serves as a proof-of-concept for image-based detection of ophthalmic diseases in general and as a basis for its further use and expansion.", "Civil liability is traditionally understood as indirect market regulation, since the risk of incurring liability for damages gives incentives to invest in safety. Such an approach, however, is inappropriate in the markets of artificial intelligence devices. In fact, according to the current paradigm of civil liability, compensation is allowed only to the extent that \"someone\" is identified as a debtor. However, in many cases it would not be useful to impose the obligation to pay such compensation to producers and programmers: the algorithms, in fact, can \"behave\" far independently from the instructions initially provided by programmers so that they can err despite no flaw in design or implementation. Therefore, application of \"traditional\" civil liability to AI may represent a disincentive to new technologies based on artificial intelligence. This is why I think artificial intelligence requires that the law evolves, on this matter, from an issue of civil liability into one of financial management of losses. No-fault redress schemes could be an interesting and worthy regulatory strategy in order to enable this evolution. Of course, such schemes should apply only in cases where there is no evidence that producers and programmers have acted under conditions of negligence, imprudence or unskillfulness and their activity is adequately compliant with scientifically validated standards.", "Background: Research publications related to the novel coronavirus disease COVID-19 are rapidly increasing. However, current online literature hubs, even with artificial intelligence, are limited in identifying the complexity of COVID-19 research topics. We developed a comprehensive Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model with 25 topics using natural language processing (NLP) techniques on PubMed\u00ae research articles about \"COVID.\" We propose a novel methodology to develop and visualise temporal trends, and improve existing online literature hubs. Our results for temporal evolution demonstrate interesting trends, for example, the prominence of \"Mental Health\" and \"Socioeconomic Impact\" increased, \"Genome Sequence\" decreased, and \"Epidemiology\" remained relatively constant. Applying our methodology to LitCovid, a literature hub from the National Center for Biotechnology Information, we improved the breadth and depth of research topics by subdividing their pre-existing categories. Our topic model demonstrates that research on \"masks\" and \"Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)\" is skewed toward clinical applications with a lack of population-based epidemiological research.", "To examine the association between hearing impairment and cognitive function after traumatic brain injury (TBI).\nA total of 18 level I trauma centers throughout the United States in the T ransforming R esearch a nd C linical K nowledge in TBI (TRACK-TBI) study.\nFrom February 2014 to June 2018, a total of 2697 participants with TBI were enrolled in TRACK-TBI. Key eligibility criteria included external force trauma to the head, presentation to a participating level I trauma center, and receipt of a clinically indicated head computed tomographic (CT) scan within 24 hours of injury. A total of 1267 participants were evaluated in the study, with 216 participants with hearing impairment and 1051 participants without hearing impairment. Those with missing or unknown hearing status or cognitive assessment were excluded from analysis.\nProspective, observational cohort study.\nHearing impairment at 2 weeks post-TBI was based on self-report. Participants who indicated worse hearing in one or both ears were defined as having hearing impairment, whereas those who denied worse hearing in either ear were defined as not having hearing impairment and served as the reference group. Cognitive outcomes at 6 months post-TBI included executive functioning and processing speed, as measured by the Trail Making Test (TMT) B/A and the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, Fourth Edition, Processing Speed Index subscale (WAIS-IV PSI), respectively.\nTBI-related hearing impairment had a small but significantly greater TMT B/A ratio than without TBI-related hearing impairment: mean difference ( B ) = 0.25; 95% CI, 0.07 to 0.43; P = .005. No significant mean differences on WAIS-IV PSI scores were found between participants with and without TBI-related hearing impairment: B = 0.36; 95% CI, -2.07 to 2.60; P = .825.\nWe conclude that TBI-related hearing impairment at 6 months postinjury was significantly associated with worse executive functioning but not cognitive processing speed.", "To develop and validate a risk prediction nomogram based on a deep learning convolutional neural networks (CNN) model and epidemiological characteristics for lung cancer screening in patients with small pulmonary nodules (SPN).\nThis study included three data sets. First, a CNN model was developed and tested on data set 1. Then, a hybrid prediction model was developed on data set 2 by multivariable binary logistic regression analysis. We combined the CNN model score and the selected epidemiological risk factors, and a risk prediction nomogram was presented. An independent multicenter cohort was used for model external validation. The performance of the nomogram was assessed with respect to its calibration and discrimination.\nThe final hybrid model included the CNN model score and the screened risk factors included age, gender, smoking status and family history of cancer. The nomogram showed good discrimination and calibration with an area under the curve (AUC) of 91.6% (95% CI: 89.4%-93.5%), compare with the CNN model, the improvement was significance. The performance of the nomogram still showed good discrimination and good calibration in the multicenter validation cohort, with an AUC of 88.3% (95% CI: 83.1%-92.3%).\nOur study showed that epidemiological characteristics should be considered in lung cancer screening, which can significantly improve the efficiency of the artificial intelligence (AI) model alone. We combined the CNN model score with Asian lung cancer epidemiological characteristics to develop a new nomogram to facilitate and accurately perform individualized lung cancer screening, especially for Asians.", "Advancements in computing and data from the near universal acceptance and implementation of electronic health records has been formative for the growth of personalized, automated, and immediate patient care models that were not previously possible. Artificial intelligence (AI) and its subfields of machine learning, reinforcement learning, and deep learning are well-suited to deal with such data. The authors in this paper review current applications of AI in clinical medicine and discuss the most likely future contributions that AI will provide to the healthcare industry. For instance, in response to the need to risk stratify patients, appropriately cultivated and curated data can assist decision-makers in stratifying preoperative patients into risk categories, as well as categorizing the severity of ailments and health for non-operative patients admitted to hospitals. Previous overt, traditional vital signs and laboratory values that are used to signal alarms for an acutely decompensating patient may be replaced by continuously monitoring and updating AI tools that can pick up early imperceptible patterns predicting subtle health deterioration. Furthermore, AI may help overcome challenges with multiple outcome optimization limitations or sequential decision-making protocols that limit individualized patient care. Despite these tremendously helpful advancements, the data sets that AI models train on and develop have the potential for misapplication and thereby create concerns for application bias. Subsequently, the mechanisms governing this disruptive innovation must be understood by clinical decision-makers to prevent unnecessary harm. This need will force physicians to change their educational infrastructure to facilitate understanding AI platforms, modeling, and limitations to best acclimate practice in the age of AI. By performing a thorough narrative review, this paper examines these specific AI applications, limitations, and requisites while reviewing a few examples of major data sets that are being cultivated and curated in the US.", "Cannabis is a commonly used recreational drug in young adults. The worldwide prevalence in 18- to 25-year-olds is approximately 35%. Significant differences in cognitive performance have been reported previously for groups of cannabis users. However, the groups are often heterogeneous in terms of cannabis use. Here, we study daily cannabis users with a confirmed diagnosis of cannabis use disorder (CUD) to examine cognitive performance on measures of memory, executive function and risky decision-making.\nForty young adult daily cannabis users with diagnosed CUD and 20 healthy controls matched for sex and premorbid intelligence quotient (IQ) were included. The neuropsychological battery implemented was designed to measure multiple modes of memory (visual, episodic and working memory), risky decision-making and other domains of executive function using subtests from the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB).\nOur results showed that young adult daily cannabis users with CUD perform significantly poorer on tasks of visual and episodic memory compared with healthy controls. In addition, executive functioning was associated with the age of onset.\nFurther research is required to determine whether worse performance in cognition results in cannabis use or is a consequence of cannabis use. Chronic heavy cannabis use during a critical period of brain development may have a particularly negative impact on cognition. Research into the persistence of cognitive differences and how they relate to functional outcomes such as academic/career performance is required.", "Recently, integrating vision and language for in-depth video understanding e.g., video captioning and video question answering, has become a promising direction for artificial intelligence. However, due to the complexity of video information, it is challenging to extract a video feature that can well represent multiple levels of concepts i.e., objects, actions and events. Meanwhile, content completeness and syntactic consistency play an important role in high-quality language-related video understanding. Motivated by these, we propose a novel framework, named Hierarchical Representation Network with Auxiliary Tasks (HRNAT), for learning multi-level representations and obtaining syntax-aware video captions. Specifically, the Cross-modality Matching Task enables the learning of hierarchical representation of videos, guided by the three-level representation of languages. The Syntax-guiding Task and the Vision-assist Task contribute to generating descriptions which are not only globally similar to the video content, but also syntax-consistent to the ground-truth description. The key components of our model are general and they can be readily applied to both video captioning and video question answering tasks. Performances for the above tasks on several benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed method compared with the state-of-the-art methods. Codes and models are also released https://github.com/riesling00/HRNAT.", "The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has shown the importance of medical research in responding to the urgent prevention and health needs to combat the devastating disease, COVID-19, that this \u03b2-coronavirus unleashed. Equally, it has demonstrated the importance of interdisciplinary working to translate scientific discovery into public and patient benefit. As we come to adjust to live with this new virus, it is important to look back and see what lessons we have learnt in the way scientific medical discoveries can be more effectively and rapidly moved into public benefit. Clinical Science has had a long and distinguished history with this Journal bearing the same name and being an important contributor to the rapidly increasing use of human pathobiological data to gain mechanistic understanding of disease mechanisms leading to new diagnostic tests and treatments. The recognition that many complex diseases engage multiple causal pathways that may vary from patient to patient, and at different times across the lifecourse, has led to the emergence of stratified or precision medicine in which the right treatment is given to the right patient at the right time and, in doing so, minimise 'non-responders' and off-target side effects. Applications of omics technologies, the digitalisation of biology and the applications of machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) are accelerating disease insights at pace with translation of discoveries into new diagnostic tests and treatments. The future of clinical science, as it morphs into translational medicine, is now creating unique possibilities where even the most intractable diseases are now open to being conquered.", "The increasingly ageing population and the tendency to live alone have led science and engineering researchers to search for health care solutions. In the COVID 19 pandemic, the elderly have been seriously affected in addition to suffering from isolation and its associated and psychological consequences. This paper provides an overview of the RobWell (Robotic-based Well-Being Monitoring and Coaching System for the Elderly in their Daily Activities) system. It is a system focused on the field of artificial intelligence for mood prediction and coaching. This paper presents a general overview of the initially proposed system as well as the preliminary results related to the home automation subsystem, autonomous robot navigation and mood estimation through machine learning prior to the final system integration, which will be discussed in future works. The main goal is to improve their mental well-being during their daily household activities. The system is composed of ambient intelligence with intelligent sensors, actuators and a robotic platform that interacts with the user. A test smart home system was set up in which the sensors, actuators and robotic platform were integrated and tested. For artificial intelligence applied to mood prediction, we used machine learning to classify several physiological signals into different moods. In robotics, it was concluded that the ROS autonomous navigation stack and its autodocking algorithm were not reliable enough for this task, while the robot's autonomy was sufficient. Semantic navigation, artificial intelligence and computer vision alternatives are being sought.", "Artificial Intelligence (AI) has recently altered the landscape of cancer research and medical oncology using traditional Machine Learning (ML) algorithms and cutting-edge Deep Learning (DL) architectures. In this review article we focus on the ML aspect of AI applications in cancer research and present the most indicative studies with respect to the ML algorithms and data used. The PubMed and dblp databases were considered to obtain the most relevant research works of the last five years. Based on a comparison of the proposed studies and their research clinical outcomes concerning the medical ML application in cancer research, three main clinical scenarios were identified. We give an overview of the well-known DL and Reinforcement Learning (RL) methodologies, as well as their application in clinical practice, and we briefly discuss Systems Biology in cancer research. We also provide a thorough examination of the clinical scenarios with respect to disease diagnosis, patient classification and cancer prognosis and survival. The most relevant studies identified in the preceding year are presented along with their primary findings. Furthermore, we examine the effective implementation and the main points that need to be addressed in the direction of robustness, explainability and transparency of predictive models. Finally, we summarize the most recent advances in the field of AI/ML applications in cancer research and medical oncology, as well as some of the challenges and open issues that need to be addressed before data-driven models can be implemented in healthcare systems to assist physicians in their daily practice.", "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a challenge in multiple ways. Just getting diagnosed can take months of visits to doctors and specialists. After the diagnosis, children are often put on long waiting lists to begin therapy, which itself consists of frequent sessions that while helpful, are usually quite taxing for both the children and their parents. And while child-directed therapies are available, adults who are on the spectrum often find little continuing support. Recent technologies are using artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), virtual reality (VR), and other advanced methods to address all of those issues with faster and easier diagnostics, and in-home therapeutic approaches designed for all ages.", "Turner syndrome is the result of the partial or complete absence of an X chromosome in phenotypic girls. This can cause an array of medical and developmental difficulties. The intelligence quotient in females with Turner syndrome has previously been described as uneven, but considered within normal range. Although their social, intellectual, and psychiatric profile is described, it is unclear to what extent these females meet the clinical criteria for neurodevelopmental or psychiatric diagnoses. The aim of this study was to examine the prevalence of neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders in females with Turner syndrome.\nA retrospective cohort study was performed with a total of 1392 females with Turner syndrome identified through the Swedish National Patient Register and compared with 1:100 age- and sex-matched controls from the general population. The associations between Turner syndrome and diagnoses of neurodevelopmental and/or psychiatric disorders were calculated using conditional logistic regression and is presented as estimated risk (odds ratio, OR, 95% confidence interval, CI) in females with Turner syndrome compared with matched controls.\nFemales with Turner syndrome had a higher risk of neurodevelopmental or psychiatric disorder (OR 1.37, 95% CI 1.20-1.57), an eightfold increased risk of intellectual disability (OR 8.59, 95% CI 6.58-11.20), and a fourfold increased risk of autism spectrum disorder (OR 4.26, 95% CI 2.94\u20116.18) compared with the controls. In addition, females with Turner syndrome had twice the risk of a diagnosis of schizophrenia and related disorders (OR 1.98, 95% CI 1.36-2.88), eating disorders (OR 2.03, 95% CI 1.42-2.91), and behavioral and emotional disorders with onset in childhood (OR 2.01, 95% CI 1.35-2.99).\nFemales with Turner syndrome have an increased risk of receiving a diagnosis of neurodevelopmental or psychiatric disorder. This warrants extensive assessment of intellectual and cognitive functions from early age, and increased psychiatric vigilance should be a part of lifelong healthcare for females with Turner syndrome.", "Medical student burnout has received increasing attention in recent years due to greater acceptance of psychological and emotional vulnerability in the health care profession. Given the significant investment of personal and financial resources in this demanding profession, continued evaluation of factors contributing to burnout in medical training is necessary. A midwestern medical college with a longstanding 4-year medical degree program created 2 regional campuses that utilize a calendar-efficient 3-year medical degree program. The objective in this study is to examine if medical student burnout scores are higher for students on the 3-year campuses and how that is affected by emotional intelligence.\nFirst- and second-year medical students voluntarily completed the Maslach Burnout Inventory for Students (scale: 1\u2009=\u2009never, 7\u2009=\u2009every day) and the Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire (scale: 1\u2009=\u2009completely disagree, 7\u2009=\u2009completely agree). Multifactor analysis of variance assessed mean differences in burnout between campus and gender. Multivariate linear regressions were used for predicting burnout from emotional intelligence.\nThree-year campus students reported significantly (P<0.010) higher mean [SD] scores (8.3 [2.0]) than the 4-year campus students (7.4 [2.4]), and female students reported significantly (P<0.049) higher scores (8.2 [2.0]) than male students (7.6 [2.4]). Five emotional intelligence facets were independently associated with increased burnout scores (R\u00b2\u2009=\u20090.26, P<0.001) but significantly varied with campus and gender.\nThere were higher burnout scores in students studying on the two 3-year campuses compared to students on the traditional 4-year campus and higher scores for female students than male students. Different facets of emotional intelligence mitigated student burnout by campus and gender.", "For a significant number of years, scientists of many persuasions have assayed natural product materials ranging from crude extracts to pure compounds, in a multitude of assays causally related to some biological processes. However, in a very significant number of submitted papers and published articles, what may be considered as canned biological assays were used, and if a positive effect was observed, then the authors would claim that the material assayed was a potential drug lead. This also occurred with pure synthetic compounds and compounds derived from natural products by simple chemical modifications. However, what has now become quite obvious-with all such classes of materials-is that there are many promiscuous players with multiple bioactivities. These can range from relatively crude extracts, pure compounds from natural products, synthetic processes that produce natural product derivatives, and even compounds that are truly synthetic in origin. There is also a potential problem with the data from crude to purified extracts being used to claim some form of beneficial activities for such materials, to sell that particular mixture to the lay public, by very careful descriptions of its possible uses due to legal hurdles. With the advent of artificial intelligence and very large compound databases, some of which may well contain impure materials, scientists from a variety of backgrounds have begun to utilize such listings to obtain compounds for their low to high throughput biological screens, without realizing that there are very significant numbers of active compounds (eg, pan assay interference compounds and invalid metabolic panaceas), that will hit in many different screens for a variety of reasons, thus leading to significant wasted efforts and published scientific articles that have incorrect results. This commentary gives some of the history of such materials but is designed to be used as a warning to both researchers and in particular, journal editors, and reviewers, that reports of biological results that are claimed to be the result of the compounds used, need to be very carefully screened for results due to such promiscuous compounds, irrespective of their nominal source(s). All literature searches were made by the author and the background knowledge has come from more than 55 years of research in industry and governmental laboratories in both the United Kingdom and the United States, for enzyme inhibitors/activators as well as antimicrobial and antitumor lead compounds mainly from natural product sources. The conclusion that I came up with as a result is this: Caveat emptor. (Curr Ther Res Clin Exp. 2021; 82:XXX-XXX) \u00a9 2021 Elsevier HS Journals, Inc.", "Dengue infection is a global threat. As of today, there is no universal dengue fever treatment or vaccines unreservedly recommended by the World Health Organization. The investigation of the specific immune response to dengue virus would support antibody discovery as therapeutics for passive immunization and vaccine design. High-throughput sequencing enables the identification of the multitude of antibodies elicited in response to dengue infection at the sequence level. Artificial intelligence can mine the complex data generated and has the potential to uncover patterns in entire antibody repertoires and detect signatures distinctive of single virus-binding antibodies. However, these machine learning have not been harnessed to determine the immune response to dengue virus. In order to enable the application of machine learning, we have benchmarked existing methods for encoding biological and chemical knowledge as inputs and have investigated novel encoding techniques. We have applied different machine learning methods such as neural networks, random forests, and support vector machines and have investigated the parameter space to determine best performing algorithms for the detection and prediction of antibody patterns at the repertoire and antibody sequence levels in dengue-infected individuals. Our results show that immune response signatures to dengue are detectable both at the antibody repertoire and at the antibody sequence levels. By combining machine learning with phylogenies and network analysis, we generated novel sequences that present dengue-binding specific signatures. These results might aid further antibody discovery and support vaccine design.", "Research outcomes on intellectual development and related disabilities in North Korea are not widely known. Therefore, the current scoping review aimed to provide preliminary insight on research topics concerning intellectual disabilities in North Korea.\nA six-stage framework for scoping review was adopted to examine research trends. Articles were categorised based on the era of supreme leader and research topic.\nThere is a greater amount of research regarding intellectual disabilities in the recent Kim Jong-un era compared to the period of the previous leader where research outcomes on general intelligence were the focus. Significant qualitative progress was similarly found.\nThe current analysis on research outcomes provides meaningful insights to aid in understanding the atmosphere in North Korea surrounding intellectual disabilities. Follow-up studies and open discussions are necessary for further progress.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) and informatics promise to improve the quality and efficiency of diagnostic radiology but will require substantially more standardization and operational coordination to realize and measure those improvements. As radiology steps into the AI-driven future we should work hard to identify the needs and desires of our customers and develop process controls to ensure we are meeting them. Rather than focusing on easy-to-measure turnaround times as surrogates for quality, AI and informatics can support more comprehensive quality metrics, such as ensuring that reports are accurate, readable, and useful to patients and health care providers.", "This study aimed to build and evaluate a deep learning, artificial intelligence (AI) model to automatically classify swallow types based on raw data from esophageal high-resolution manometry (HRM).\nHRM studies on patients with no history of esophageal surgery were collected including 1,741\u00a0studies with 26,115\u00a0swallows labeled by swallow type (normal, hypercontractile, weak-fragmented, failed, and premature) by an expert interpreter per the Chicago Classification. The dataset was stratified and split into train/validation/test datasets for model development. Long short-term memory (LSTM), a type of deep-learning AI model, was trained and evaluated. The overall performance and detailed per-swallow type performance were analyzed. The interpretations of the supine swallows in a single study were further used to generate an overall classification of peristalsis.\nThe LSTM model for swallow type yielded accuracies from the train/validation/test datasets of 0.86/0.81/0.83. The model's interpretation for study-level classification of peristalsis yielded accuracy of 0.88 in the test dataset. Among model misclassification, 535/698 (77%) swallows and 25/35 (71%) studies were to adjacent categories, for example, normal to weak or normal to ineffective, respectively.\nA deep-learning AI model can automatically and accurately identify the Chicago Classification swallow types and peristalsis classification from raw HRM data. While future work to refine this model and incorporate overall manometric diagnoses are needed, this study demonstrates the role that AI will serve in the interpretation and classification of esophageal HRM studies.", "The combination of biological neurology and memristive theory has greatly promoted the development of neuromorphic computing. To build a large-scale artificial intelligence alert system, the exploration of bionic synapses compatible with standard processes has become an urgent problem to be solved in the next step. In response to the above application requirements, this paper proposes a volatile avalanche diode threshold switching (VADTS) that is fully compatible with standard semiconductor technology to simulate the various functions of the synapse. Technology computer-aided design device-level simulation can verify the bionic principle of VADTS. The function of VADTS's bionic synapse was verified by the experimental test platform. The results show that under the action of the excitation signal (11.25\u00a0V), the device can continuously change from a high-resistance state to a low-resistance state. When the excitation signal is lower than the threshold, VADTS presents a \"no adaptation\" state of nerve synapses. When the excitation signal is higher than the threshold and changes continuously, the current changes along with the amplitude of the excitation signal, similar to the \"sensitization\" state of the nerve synapse.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) has been successful at solving numerous problems in machine perception. In radiology, AI systems are rapidly evolving and show progress in guiding treatment decisions, diagnosing, localizing disease on medical images, and improving radiologists' efficiency. A critical component to deploying AI in radiology is to gain confidence in a developed system's efficacy and safety. The current gold standard approach is to conduct an analytical validation of performance on a generalization dataset from one or more institutions, followed by a clinical validation study of the system's efficacy during deployment. Clinical validation studies are time-consuming, and best practices dictate limited re-use of analytical validation data, so it is ideal to know ahead of time if a system is likely to fail analytical or clinical validation. In this paper, we describe a series of sanity tests to identify when a system performs well on development data for the wrong reasons. We illustrate the sanity tests' value by designing a deep learning system to classify pancreatic cancer seen in computed tomography scans.", "Growing interest in the applications of artificial intelligence (AI) and, in particular, deep learning (DL) in nuclear medicine and radiology partitions the professional community. At one end of the spectrum are our expert DL wizards developing potion-like code and waving the DL capabilities like a wand across our professions. On the opposite side of the spectrum are our muggle colleagues who lack the wizardry of DL and may be largely oblivious to the entire magical realm.\nAs crafted by Arthur C Clark, any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. DL is not only an important technology in the future of medical imaging, but its application lives in the capabilities of medical imaging technologists. This may be incidental through application of techniques at the patient interface, through role expansion in data curation and management, or as active members of DL projects and development. Understanding the rudimentary principles of DL is emerging as requisite in medical imaging.\nAI and DL are valuable tools in advancing capabilities and outcomes in medical imaging. A working knowledge of the technology and techniques is important and achievable for the medical imaging technologist even when capability in application of DL to research and clinical practice is not within one's interests or scope of practice.\nWhile there is no requisite for all of the professional community to be tutored in the wizardry of DL, there are benefits for the profession and our patients for all to have a rudimentary understanding of the language and landscape. The breadth of DL literature assumes a level of understanding not evident for the bulk of our professions. This manuscript provides a simplified primer on DL with the aim of arming the muggles among us with sufficient insight to navigate the magical realm of DL without transferring any wizardry capability itself.", "Radiologists have been at the forefront of the digitization process in medicine. Artificial intelligence (AI) is a promising area of innovation, particularly in medical imaging. The number of applications of AI in neuroradiology has also grown. This article illustrates some of these applications. This article reviews machine learning challenges related to neuroradiology. The first approval of reimbursement for an AI algorithm by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, covering a stroke software for early detection of large vessel occlusion, is also discussed.", "Adverse outcome pathways (AOPs) are a conceptual framework developed to support the use of alternative toxicology approaches in the risk assessment. AOPs are structured linear organizations of existing knowledge illustrating causal pathways from the initial molecular perturbation triggered by various stressors, through key events (KEs) at different levels of biology, to the ultimate health or ecotoxicological adverse outcome.\nArtificial intelligence can be used to systematically explore available toxicological data that can be parsed in the scientific literature. Recently, a tool called AOP-helpFinder was developed to identify associations between stressors and KEs supporting thus documentation of AOPs. To facilitate the utilization of this advanced bioinformatics tool by the scientific and the regulatory community, a webserver was created. The proposed AOP-helpFinder webserver uses better performing version of the tool which reduces the need for manual curation of the obtained results. As an example, the server was successfully applied to explore relationships of a set of endocrine disruptors with metabolic-related events. The AOP-helpFinder webserver assists in a rapid evaluation of existing knowledge stored in the PubMed database, a global resource of scientific information, to build AOPs and Adverse Outcome Networks supporting the chemical risk assessment.\nAOP-helpFinder is available at http://aop-helpfinder.u-paris-sciences.fr/index.php.\nSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) digital health systems have drawn much attention over the last decade. However, their implementation into medical practice occurs at a much slower pace than expected. This paper reviews some of the achievements of first-generation AI systems, and the barriers facing their implementation into medical practice. The development of second-generation AI systems is discussed with a focus on overcoming some of these obstacles. Second-generation systems are aimed at focusing on a single subject and on improving patients' clinical outcomes. A personalized closed-loop system designed to improve end-organ function and the patient's response to chronic therapies is presented. The system introduces a platform which implements a personalized therapeutic regimen and introduces quantifiable individualized-variability patterns into its algorithm. The platform is designed to achieve a clinically meaningful endpoint by ensuring that chronic therapies will have sustainable effect while overcoming compensatory mechanisms associated with disease progression and drug resistance. Second-generation systems are expected to assist patients and providers in adopting and implementing of these systems into everyday care.", "Barrett's esophagus (BE) is the precursor lesion for esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) development. Unfortunately, BE screening/surveillance has not provided the anticipated EAC reduction benefit. Noninvasive techniques are increasingly available or undergoing testing to screen for BE among those with/without known risk factors, and the use of artificial intelligence platforms to aid endoscopic screening and surveillance will likely become routine, minimizing missed cases or lesions. Management of high-grade dysplasia and intramucosal EAC is clear with endoscopic eradication therapy preferred to surgery. BE with low-grade dysplasia can be managed with removal of visible lesions combined with endoscopic eradication therapy or endoscopic surveillance at present.", "A massive amount of multimodal data are continuously collected in the intensive care unit (ICU) along each patient stay, offering a great opportunity for the development of smart monitoring devices based on artificial intelligence (AI). The two main sources of relevant information collected in the ICU are the electronic health records (EHRs) and vital sign waveforms continuously recorded at the bedside. While EHRs are already widely processed by AI algorithms for prompt diagnosis and prognosis, AI-based assessments of the patients' pathophysiological state using waveforms are less developed, and their use is still limited to real-time monitoring for basic visual vital sign feedback at the bedside. This study uses data from the MIMIC-III database (PhysioNet) to propose a novel AI approach in ICU patient monitoring that incorporates features estimated by a closed-loop cardiovascular model, with the specific goal of identifying sepsis within the first hour of admission. Our top benchmark results (AUROC\u2009=\u20090.92, AUPRC\u2009=\u20090.90) suggest that features derived by cardiovascular control models may play a key role in identifying sepsis, by continuous monitoring performed through advanced multivariate modelling of vital sign waveforms. This work lays foundations for a deeper data integration paradigm which will help clinicians in their decision-making processes. This article is part of the theme issue 'Advanced computation in cardiovascular physiology: new challenges and opportunities'.", "Approximately two-thirds of patients with major depressive disorder do not achieve remission during their first treatment. There has been increasing interest in the use of digital, artificial intelligence-powered clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) to assist physicians in their treatment selection and management, improving the personalization and use of best practices such as measurement-based care. Previous literature shows that for digital mental health tools to be successful, the tool must be easy for patients and physicians to use and feasible within existing clinical workflows.\nThis study aims to examine the feasibility of an artificial intelligence-powered CDSS, which combines the operationalized 2016 Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments guidelines with a neural network-based individualized treatment remission prediction.\nOwing to the COVID-19 pandemic, the study was adapted to be completed entirely remotely. A total of 7 physicians recruited outpatients diagnosed with major depressive disorder according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition criteria. Patients completed a minimum of one visit without the CDSS (baseline) and 2 subsequent visits where the CDSS was used by the physician (visits 1 and 2). The primary outcome of interest was change in appointment length after the introduction of the CDSS as a proxy for feasibility. Feasibility and acceptability data were collected through self-report questionnaires and semistructured interviews.\nData were collected between January and November 2020. A total of 17 patients were enrolled in the study; of the 17 patients, 14 (82%) completed the study. There was no significant difference in appointment length between visits (introduction of the tool did not increase appointment length; F2,24=0.805; mean squared error 58.08; P=.46). In total, 92% (12/13) of patients and 71% (5/7) of physicians felt that the tool was easy to use; 62% (8/13) of patients and 71% (5/7) of physicians rated that they trusted the CDSS. Of the 13 patients, 6 (46%) felt that the patient-clinician relationship significantly or somewhat improved, whereas 7 (54%) felt that it did not change.\nOur findings confirm that the integration of the tool does not significantly increase appointment length and suggest that the CDSS is easy to use and may have positive effects on the patient-physician relationship for some patients. The CDSS is feasible and ready for effectiveness studies.\nClinicalTrials.gov NCT04061642; http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04061642.", "Whole-body magnetic resonance imaging (WB-MRI) is currently used worldwide for detecting bone metastases from prostate cancer. The 5-year survival rate for prostate cancer is\u2009>\u200995%. However, an increase in survival time may increase the incidence of bone metastasis. Therefore, detecting bone metastases is of great clinical interest. Bone metastases are commonly located in the spine, pelvis, shoulder, and distal femur. Bone metastases from prostate cancer are well-known representatives of osteoblastic metastases. However, other types of bone metastases, such as mixed or inter-trabecular type, have also been detected using MRI. MRI does not involve radiation exposure and has good sensitivity and specificity for detecting bone metastases. WB-MRI has undergone gradual developments since the last century, and in 2004, Takahara et al., developed diffusion-weighted Imaging (DWI) with background body signal suppression (DWIBS). Since then, WB-MRI, including DWI, has continued to play an important role in detecting bone metastases and monitoring therapeutic effects. An imaging protocol that allows complete examination within approximately 30\u00a0min has been established. This review focuses on WB-MRI standardization and the automatic calculation of tumor total diffusion volume (tDV) and mean apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) value. In the future, artificial intelligence (AI) will enable shorter imaging times and easier automatic segmentation.", "Artificial Intelligence and its subdomain, Machine Learning (ML), have shown the potential to make an unprecedented impact in healthcare. Federated Learning (FL) has been introduced to alleviate some of the limitations of ML, particularly the capability to train on larger datasets for improved performance, which is usually cumbersome for an inter-institutional collaboration due to existing patient protection laws and regulations. Moreover, FL may also play a crucial role in circumventing ML's exigent bias problem by accessing underrepresented groups' data spanning geographically distributed locations. In this paper, we have discussed three FL challenges, namely: privacy of the model exchange, ethical perspectives, and legal considerations. Lastly, we have proposed a model that could aide in assessing data contributions of a FL implementation. In light of the expediency and adaptability of using the S\u00f8rensen-Dice Coefficient over the more limited (e.g., horizontal FL) and computationally expensive Shapley Values, we sought to demonstrate a new paradigm that we hope, will become invaluable for sharing any profit and responsibilities that may accompany a FL endeavor.", "Visualization and photodocumentation during endoscopy procedures are suggested to be one indicator for endoscopy performance quality. However, this indicator is difficult to measure and audit manually in clinical practice. Artificial intelligence (AI) is an emerging technology that may solve this problem.\nA deep learning model with an accuracy of 96.64% was developed from 15,305 images for upper endoscopy anatomy classification in the unit. Endoscopy images for asymptomatic patients receiving screening endoscopy were evaluated with this model to assess the completeness of photodocumentation rate.\nA total of 15,723 images from 472 upper endoscopies performed by 12 endoscopists were enrolled. The complete photodocumentation rate from the pharynx to the duodenum was 53.8% and from the esophagus to the duodenum was 78.0% in this study. Endoscopists with a higher adenoma detection rate had a higher complete examination rate from the pharynx to duodenum (60.0% vs. 38.7%, P\u2009<\u20090.0001) and from esophagus to duodenum (83.0% vs. 65.7%, P\u2009<\u20090.0001) compared with endoscopists with lower adenoma detection rate. The pharynx, gastric angle, gastric retroflex view, gastric antrum, and the first portion of duodenum are likely to be missed by endoscopists with lower adenoma detection rates.\nWe report the use of a deep learning model to audit endoscopy photodocumentation quality in our unit. Endoscopists with better performance in colonoscopy had a better performance for this quality indicator. The use of such an AI system may help the endoscopy unit audit endoscopy performance.", "Diabetic macular edema (DME), being a frequent manifestation of DR, disrupts the retinal symmetry. This event is particularly triggered by vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGF). Intravitreal injections of anti-VEGFs have been the most practiced treatment but an expensive option. A major challenge associated with this treatment is determining an optimal treatment regimen and differentiating patients who do not respond to anti-VEGF. As it has a significant burden for both the patient and the health care providers if the patient is not responding, any clinically acceptable method to predict the treatment outcomes holds huge value in the efficient management of DME. In such situations, artificial intelligence (AI) or machine learning (ML)-based algorithms come useful as they can analyze past clinical details of the patients and help clinicians to predict the patient's response to an anti-VEGF agent. The work presented here attempts to review the literature that is available from the peer research community to discuss solutions provided by AI/ML methodologies to tackle challenges in DME management. Lastly, a possibility for using two different types of data has been proposed, which is believed to be the key differentiators as compared to the similar and recent contributions from the peer research community.", "Machine learning is a good tool to simulate human cognitive skills as it is about mapping perceived information to various labels or action choices, aiming at optimal behavior policies for a human or an artificial agent operating in the environment. Regarding autonomous systems, objects and situations are perceived by some receptors as divided between sensors. Reactions to the input (e.g., actions) are distributed among the particular capability providers or actuators. Cognitive models can be trained as, for example, neural networks. We suggest training such models for cases of potential disabilities. Disability can be either the absence of one or more cognitive sensors or actuators at different levels of cognitive model. We adapt several neural network architectures to simulate various cognitive disabilities. The idea has been triggered by the \"coolability\" (enhanced capability) paradox, according to which a person with some disability can be more efficient in using other capabilities. Therefore, an autonomous system (human or artificial) pretrained with simulated disabilities will be more efficient when acting in adversarial conditions. We consider these coolabilities as complementary artificial intelligence and argue on the usefulness if this concept for various applications.", "Background Imaging assessment for hepatomegaly is not well defined and currently uses suboptimal, unidimensional measures. Liver volume provides a more direct measure for organ enlargement. Purpose To determine organ volume and to establish thresholds for hepatomegaly with use of a validated deep learning artificial intelligence tool that automatically segments the liver. Materials and Methods In this retrospective study, liver volumes were successfully derived with use of a deep learning tool for asymptomatic outpatient adults who underwent multidetector CT for colorectal cancer screening (unenhanced) or renal donor evaluation (contrast-enhanced) at a single medical center between April 2004 and December 2016. The performance of the craniocaudal and maximal three-dimensional (3D) linear measures was assessed. The manual liver volume results were compared with the automated results in a subset of renal donors in which the entire liver was included at both precontrast and postcontrast CT. Unenhanced liver volumes were standardized to a postcontrast equivalent, reflecting a correction of 3.6%. Linear regression analysis was performed to assess the major patient-specific determinant or determinants of liver volume among age, sex, height, weight, and body surface area. Results A total of 3065 patients (mean age \u00b1 standard deviation, 54 years \u00b1 12; 1639 women) underwent multidetector CT for colorectal screening (n = 1960) or renal donor evaluation (n = 1105). The mean standardized automated liver volume \u00b1 standard deviation was 1533 mL \u00b1 375 and demonstrated a normal distribution. Patient weight was the major determinant of liver volume and demonstrated a linear relationship. From this result, a linear weight-based upper limit of normal hepatomegaly threshold volume was derived: hepatomegaly (mL) = 14.0 \u00d7 (weight [kg]) + 979. A craniocaudal threshold of 19 cm was 71% sensitive (49 of 69 patients) and 86% specific (887 of 1030 patients) for hepatomegaly, and a maximal 3D linear threshold of 24 cm was 78% sensitive (54 of 69) and 66% specific (678 of 1030). In the subset of 189 patients, the median difference in hepatic volume between the deep learning tool and the semiautomated or manual method was 2.3% (38 mL). Conclusion A simple weight-based threshold for hepatomegaly derived by using a fully automated CT-based liver volume segmentation based on deep learning provided an objective and more accurate assessment of liver size than linear measures. \u00a9 RSNA, 2021 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

In recent years, nanopore-based sensors have been employed to detect, identify, and classify virus particles. By tracing ionic current containing target molecules across nano-scale pores, nanopore sensors can recognize the target molecules at the single-molecule level. In the case of viruses, they enable discrimination of individual viruses and obtaining important information on the physical and chemical properties of viral particles. Despite classical benchtop virus detection methods, such as amplification techniques (e.g., PCR) or immunological assays (e.g., ELISA), that are mainly laboratory-based, expensive and time-consuming, nanopore-based sensing methods can enable low-cost and real-time point-of-care (PoC) and point-of-need (PoN) monitoring of target viruses. This review discusses the limitations of classical virus detection methods in PoN virus monitoring and then provides a comprehensive overview of nanopore sensing technology and its emerging applications in quantifying virus particles and classifying virus sub-types. Afterward, it discusses the recent progress in the field of nanopore sensing, including integrating nanopore sensors with microfabrication technology, microfluidics and artificial intelligence, which have been demonstrated to be promising in developing the next generation of low-cost and portable biosensors for the sensitive recognition of viruses and emerging pathogens.", "The aim of the study was to analyse the reliability of an offline artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm for community screening of diabetic retinopathy.\nA total of 1378 patients with diabetes visiting public dispensaries under the administration of the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai between August 2018 and September 2019 were enrolled for the study. Fundus images were captured by non-specialist operators using a smartphone-based camera covering the posterior pole, including the disc and macula, and the nasal and temporal fields. The offline AI algorithm on the smartphone marked the images as referable diabetic retinopathy (RDR) or non-RDR, which were then compared against the grading by two vitreoretinal surgeons to derive upon the sensitivity and specificity of the algorithm.\nOut of 1378 patients, gradable fundus images were obtained and analysed for 1294 patients. The sensitivity and specificity of diagnosing RDR were 100% (95% CI: 94.72-100.00%) and 89.55% (95% CI: 87.76-91.16%), respectively; the same values for any diabetic retinopathy (DR) were 89.13% (95% CI: 82.71-93.79%) and 94.43% (95% CI: 91.89-94.74%), respectively, with no false-negative results.\nThe robustness of the offline AI algorithm was established in this study making it a reliable tool for community-based DR screening.", "The purpose of this study was to expand internal construct validity and equivalence research of the South African Personality Inventory (SAPI), as well as to investigate the nomological validity of the SAPI by examining its relationship with specific and relevant psychological outcomes. The internal and external validity of the SAPI was assessed within three separate samples (N = 936). Using the combined data from all three samples, Exploratory Structural Equation Modelling (ESEM) indicated that the six-factor SAPI model fit proved to be excellent. Measurement invariance analyses showed that the SAPI dimensions in the ESEM model were invariant across gender and race groups. Next, two separate studies explored the associations of the SAPI factors with relevant psychological outcomes. An ESEM-within-CFA (set ESEM) method was used to add the factors into a new input file to correlate them with variables that were not part of the initial ESEM model. Both models generated excellent fit. In Study 1, psychological well-being and cultural intelligence were correlated with the SAPI factors within a sample of students and working adults. All of the psychological well-being dimensions significantly correlated with the SAPI factors, while for cultural intelligence, the highest correlations were between Meta-cognition and Openness and Meta-cognition and Positive Social-Relational Disposition. In Study 2, work locus of control and trait anxiety was correlated with the SAPI factors within a sample of adults from the general South African workforce. Work Locus of Control correlated with most factors of the SAPI, but more prominently with Positive Social-Relational Disposition, while Neuroticism correlated strongly with trait anxiety. Finding an appropriate internal structure that measures personality without bias in a culturally diverse context is difficult. This study provided strong evidence that the SAPI meets the demanding requirements of personality measurement in this context and generated promising results to support the relevance of the SAPI factors.", "The prediction of anatomical structures within the surgical field by artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to support surgeons' experience and cognitive skills. We aimed to develop a deep-learning model to automatically segment loose connective tissue fibers (LCTFs) that define a safe dissection plane. The annotation was performed on video frames capturing a robot-assisted gastrectomy performed by trained surgeons. A deep-learning model based on U-net was developed to output segmentation results. Twenty randomly sampled frames were provided to evaluate model performance by comparing Recall and F1/Dice scores with a ground truth and with a two-item questionnaire on sensitivity and misrecognition that was completed by 20 surgeons. The model produced high Recall scores (mean 0.606, maximum 0.861). Mean F1/Dice scores reached 0.549 (range 0.335-0.691), showing acceptable spatial overlap of the objects. Surgeon evaluators gave a mean sensitivity score of 3.52 (with 88.0% assigning the highest score of 4; range 2.45-3.95). The mean misrecognition score was a low 0.14 (range 0-0.7), indicating very few acknowledged over-detection failures. Thus, AI can be trained to predict fine, difficult-to-discern anatomical structures at a level convincing to expert surgeons. This technology may help reduce adverse events by determining safe dissection planes.", "We investigated the diagnostic progression to bipolar disorder (BD) among adolescents and young adults with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).\nUsing the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database, we enrolled adolescents and young adults aged 10-29 years with ADHD between January 1, 2001, and December 31, 2010, who were followed up until December 31, 2011, to determine progression to BD. Cox regression analysis was used to examine candidate risk and protective factors.\nAt the 11-year follow-up, the progression rate from ADHD to BD was 5.12%. Of the participants who progressed, 62.16% (322/518) progressed within the first 3 years. Risk factors for progression were as follows: older age (hazard ratio [HR], 1.058; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.033-1.084), comorbidity with autistic spectrum disorder (HR, 1.839; 95% CI, 1.415-2.391), disruptive behavior disorder (HR, 1.434; 95% CI, 1.132-1.816), intelligence disability (HR, 1.744; 95% CI, 1.399-2.176), depressive disorder (HR, 1.978; 95% CI, 1.577-2.482), alcohol use disorder (HR, 1.705; 95% CI, 1.057-2.751), cluster A (HR, 2.508; 95% CI, 1.167-5.391) or B (HR, 2.718; 95% CI, 1.974-3.741) personality disorder, and a family history of BD (HR, 2.618; 95% CI, 1.823-3.758) Identified protective factors were male sex (HR, 0.771; 95% CI, 0.630-0.943) and cluster C personality disorder (HR, 0.278; 95% CI, 0.086-0.898).\nThe study demonstrated the specific risk and protective factors for BD progression among adolescents and young adults with ADHD. It is important for clinician and mental health care providers to recognize identified factors to focus on early detection and prompt intervention.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming many domains, including finance, agriculture, defense, and biomedicine. In this paper, we focus on the role of AI in clinical and translational research (CTR), including preclinical research (T1), clinical research (T2), clinical implementation (T3), and public (or population) health (T4). Given the rapid evolution of AI in CTR, we present three complementary perspectives: (1) scoping literature review, (2) survey, and (3) analysis of federally funded projects. For each CTR phase, we addressed challenges, successes, failures, and opportunities for AI. We surveyed Clinical and Translational Science Award (CTSA) hubs regarding AI projects at their institutions. Nineteen of 63 CTSA hubs (30%) responded to the survey. The most common funding source (48.5%) was the federal government. The most common translational phase was T2 (clinical research, 40.2%). Clinicians were the intended users in 44.6% of projects and researchers in 32.3% of projects. The most common computational approaches were supervised machine learning (38.6%) and deep learning (34.2%). The number of projects steadily increased from 2012 to 2020. Finally, we analyzed 2604 AI projects at CTSA hubs using the National Institutes of Health Research Portfolio Online Reporting Tools (RePORTER) database for 2011-2019. We mapped available abstracts to medical subject headings and found that nervous system (16.3%) and mental disorders (16.2) were the most common topics addressed. From a computational perspective, big data (32.3%) and deep learning (30.0%) were most common. This work represents a snapshot in time of the role of AI in the CTSA program.", "The functional diversification and adaptability of the elementary switching units of computational circuits are disruptive approaches for advancing electronics beyond the static capabilities of conventional complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor-based architectures. Thereto, in this work the one-dimensional nature of monocrystalline and monolithic Al-Ge-based nanowire heterostructures is exploited to deliver charge carrier polarity control and furthermore to enable distinct programmable negative differential resistance at runtime. The fusion of electron and hole conduction together with negative differential resistance in a universal adaptive transistor may enable energy-efficient reconfigurable circuits with multivalued operability that are inherent components of emerging artificial intelligence electronics.", "Objectives. In health and safety at work, two main groups of causes of occupational accidents have been identified: unsafe conditions or technical factors; and the causes related to safe behavior or the human factor. The objective of this study is to analyze the predictive variables (emotional intelligence, personality, impulsivity and safety of the work environment) for three factors of the CONS-32 scale (criterion variables: use of protections, personal risk behavior and personal physical workload) in the construction sector. Methods. Using a sample of 256 Spanish workers from this sector, we analyzed the significant correlations between the three criterion variables and a set of variables extracted from various instruments, as well as the regression models that explain most of the variance. Results. The results show that the main predictive variables that explain the three factors are those related to responsibility as a personality trait, impulsivity and safety of the work environment. Conclusions. Based on the empirical evidence found, the most explanatory factor in all cases is safety climate in the work environment.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) tools are increasingly being used within healthcare for various purposes, including helping patients to adhere to drug regimens. The aim of this narrative review was to describe: (1) studies on AI tools that can be used to measure and increase medication adherence in patients with non-communicable diseases (NCDs); (2) the benefits of using AI for these purposes; (3) challenges of the use of AI in healthcare; and (4) priorities for future research. We discuss the current AI technologies, including mobile phone applications, reminder systems, tools for patient empowerment, instruments that can be used in integrated care, and machine learning. The use of AI may be key to understanding the complex interplay of factors that underly medication non-adherence in NCD patients. AI-assisted interventions aiming to improve communication between patients and physicians, monitor drug consumption, empower patients, and ultimately, increase adherence levels may lead to better clinical outcomes and increase the quality of life of NCD patients. However, the use of AI in healthcare is challenged by numerous factors; the characteristics of users can impact the effectiveness of an AI tool, which may lead to further inequalities in healthcare, and there may be concerns that it could depersonalize medicine. The success and widespread use of AI technologies will depend on data storage capacity, processing power, and other infrastructure capacities within healthcare systems. Research is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of AI solutions in different patient groups and establish the barriers to widespread adoption, especially in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has led to a rapid increase in the use and development of digital health technologies.", "Danon disease is typically lethal by the mid-twenties in male patients due to cardiomyopathy. This report aims to describe two unrelated male patients showing mild manifestations of the disease. A 39-year-old man presented with a 10-year history of elevated serum creatine kinase levels with slowly progressive muscle weakness. Muscle pathology showed autophagic vacuoles with sarcolemmal features. Genetic testing revealed a hemizygous mutation in exon 9b, an alternatively spliced exon, of lysosome-associated membrane protein-2 (LAMP-2) (c.1097_1098delAA). Cardiac testing showed asymptomatic mild left ventricular hypertrophy. He had borderline intelligence. Early stage of retinopathy was detected. Another male patient, currently 53-year-old, had asymptomatic supraventricular extrasystole and muscle weakness but no intellectual disability, harboring the same mutation. He also had retinopathy. The present patients commonly carry a mutation in exon 9b of LAMP-2, suggesting that mutations in the exon are associated with a mild form of Danon disease.", "At the time of writing this article, the world population is suffering from more than 2 million registered COVID-19 disease epidemic-induced deaths since the outbreak of the corona virus, which is now officially known as SARS-CoV-2. However, tremendous efforts have been made worldwide to counter-steer and control the epidemic by now labelled as pandemic. In this contribution, we provide an overview on the potential for computer audition (CA), i.e., the usage of speech and sound analysis by artificial intelligence to help in this scenario. We first survey which types of related or contextually significant phenomena can be automatically assessed from speech or sound. These include the automatic recognition and monitoring of COVID-19 directly or its symptoms such as breathing, dry, and wet coughing or sneezing sounds, speech under cold, eating behaviour, sleepiness, or pain to name but a few. Then, we consider potential use-cases for exploitation. These include risk assessment and diagnosis based on symptom histograms and their development over time, as well as monitoring of spread, social distancing and its effects, treatment and recovery, and patient well-being. We quickly guide further through challenges that need to be faced for real-life usage and limitations also in comparison with non-audio solutions. We come to the conclusion that CA appears ready for implementation of (pre-)diagnosis and monitoring tools, and more generally provides rich and significant, yet so far untapped potential in the fight against COVID-19 spread.", "With the rapid development of high-throughput sequencing technology and computer science, the amount of large omics data has increased exponentially, the advantages of multi-omics analysis have gradually emerged, and the application of artificial intelligence has become more and more extensive. In this review, we introduce the application progress of multi-omics data analysis and artificial intelligence in the medical field in recent years, and also show the cases and advantages of their combined application. Finally, we briefly explain the current challenges of multi-omics analysis and artificial intelligence in order to provide new research ideas for the medical industry and to promote the development and application of precision medicine.\n\u968f\u7740\u9ad8\u901a\u91cf\u6d4b\u5e8f\u6280\u672f\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u79d1\u5b66\u7684\u98de\u901f\u53d1\u5c55,\u7ec4\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u6307\u6570\u500d\u589e\u957f,\u591a\u7ec4\u5b66\u5206\u6790\u4f18\u52bf\u9010\u6e10\u663e\u73b0,\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u5e94\u7528\u4e5f\u6108\u52a0\u5e7f\u6cdb\u3002\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u8fd1\u5e74\u6765\u591a\u7ec4\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u548c\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u5404\u81ea\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u8fdb\u5c55,\u540c\u65f6\u4e5f\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e24\u8005\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u6848\u4f8b\u4ee5\u53ca\u4f18\u52bf,\u6700\u540e\u7b80\u5355\u9610\u8ff0\u591a\u7ec4\u5b66\u5206\u6790\u548c\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u5728\u73b0\u9636\u6bb5\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u6311\u6218,\u65e8\u5728\u4e3a\u533b\u5b66\u884c\u4e1a\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u601d\u8def,\u52a9\u63a8\u7cbe\u51c6\u533b\u5b66\u53d1\u5c55\u5e94\u7528\u3002.", "Internet of Things (IoT) is a concept adopted in nearly every aspect of human life, leading to an explosive utilization of intelligent devices. Notably, such solutions are especially integrated in the industrial sector, to allow the remote monitoring and control of critical infrastructure. Such global integration of IoT solutions has led to an expanded attack surface against IoT-enabled infrastructures. Artificial intelligence and machine learning have demonstrated their ability to resolve issues that would have been impossible or difficult to address otherwise; thus, such solutions are closely associated with securing IoT. Classical collaborative and distributed machine learning approaches are known to compromise sensitive information. In our paper, we demonstrate the creation of a network flow-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) aiming to protecting critical infrastructures, stemming from the pairing of two machine learning techniques, namely, federated learning and active learning. The former is utilized for privately training models in federation, while the latter is a semi-supervised approach applied for global model adaptation to each of the participant's traffic. Experimental results indicate that global models perform significantly better for each participant, when locally personalized with just a few active learning queries. Specifically, we demonstrate how the accuracy increase can reach 7.07% in only 10 queries.", "Automatic segmentation of vestibular schwannomas (VS) from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) could significantly improve clinical workflow and assist patient management. We have previously developed a novel artificial intelligence framework based on a 2.5D convolutional neural network achieving excellent results equivalent to those achieved by an independent human annotator. Here, we provide the first publicly-available annotated imaging dataset of VS by releasing the data and annotations used in our prior work. This collection contains a labelled dataset of 484 MR images collected on 242 consecutive patients with a VS undergoing Gamma Knife Stereotactic Radiosurgery at a single institution. Data includes all segmentations and contours used in treatment planning and details of the administered dose. Implementation of our automated segmentation algorithm uses MONAI, a freely-available open-source framework for deep learning in healthcare imaging. These data will facilitate the development and validation of automated segmentation frameworks for VS and may also be used to develop other multi-modal algorithmic models.", "Successful adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) in medical imaging requires medical professionals to understand underlying principles and techniques. However, educational offerings tailored to the need of medical professionals are scarce. To fill this gap, we created the course \"AI for Doctors: Medical Imaging\". An analysis of participants' opinions on AI and self-perceived skills rated on a five-point Likert scale was conducted before and after the course. The participants' attitude towards AI in medical imaging was very optimistic before and after the course. However, deeper knowledge of AI and the process for validating and deploying it resulted in significantly less overoptimism with respect to perceivable patient benefits through AI (p = 0.020). Self-assessed skill ratings significantly improved after the course, and the appreciation of the course content was very positive. However, we observed a substantial drop-out rate, mostly attributed to the lack of time of medical professionals. There is a high demand for educational offerings regarding AI in medical imaging among medical professionals, and better education may lead to a more realistic appreciation of clinical adoption. However, time constraints imposed by a busy clinical schedule need to be taken into account for successful education of medical professionals.", "The potential of artificial intelligence (AI) in radiology goes far beyond image analysis. AI can be used to optimize all steps of the radiology workflow by supporting a variety of nondiagnostic tasks, including order entry support, patient scheduling, resource allocation, and improving the radiologist's workflow. This article discusses several principal directions of using AI algorithms to improve radiological operations and workflow management, with the intention of providing a broader understanding of the value of applying AI in the radiology department.", "Perfectionism or a tendency to aim for an unrealistic standard can impair happiness. However, the potential mechanisms of perfectionism to explain the association between trait emotional intelligence (EI) and happiness are still understudied. This study explores the mediating role of perfectionism in the relationship between trait emotional intelligence (EI) and happiness among young adults. A cross-sectional sample of 259 young adults aged between 18 to 35 years old was recruited. All analyses were conducted using SPSS and AMOS Structural Equation Modeling. High trait EI was linked to low perfectionism and high happiness levels. Furthermore, perfectionism mediated the relationship between trait EI and happiness. Although high trait EI lowered maladaptive perfectionism, the negative impact of maladaptive perfectionism remained and subsequently led to decreasing happiness levels of young adults. This study offers an enhanced understanding of the role of perfectionism in explaining the happiness state of young adults. Moreover, it provides practical implications for using trait EI and managing perfectionism tendency to manage the happiness and wellbeing of the young adult population.", "We present an overview of current clinical musculoskeletal imaging applications for artificial intelligence, as well as potential future applications and techniques.", "Recent developments in computational physiology have successfully exploited advanced signal processing and artificial intelligence tools for predicting or uncovering characteristic features of physiological and pathological states in humans. While these advanced tools have demonstrated excellent diagnostic capabilities, the high complexity of these computational 'black boxes' may severely limit scientific inference, especially in terms of biological insight about both physiology and pathological aberrations. This theme issue highlights current challenges and opportunities of advanced computational tools for processing dynamical data reflecting autonomic nervous system dynamics, with a specific focus on cardiovascular control physiology and pathology. This includes the development and adaptation of complex signal processing methods, multivariate cardiovascular models, multiscale and nonlinear models for central-peripheral dynamics, as well as deep and transfer learning algorithms applied to large datasets. The width of this perspective highlights the issues of specificity in heartbeat-related features and supports the need for an imminent transition from the black-box paradigm to explainable and personalized clinical models in cardiovascular research. This article is part of the theme issue 'Advanced computation in cardiovascular physiology: new challenges and opportunities'.", "The combination of primary and secondary prevention has already influenced the colposcopic practice by reduction in HPV (human papillomavirus) vaccine-type HSIL (HIGH-GRADE SIL), colposcopy referral numbers, colposcopic positive predictive value (PPV) for CIN2+, and by modification of referral pattern, colposcopic performance, and procedures. Different strategies, both isolated and combined, have been proposed in order to maintain the diagnostic accuracy of colposcopy: patient risk stratification based on immediate or future risk of CIN3+ or on HPV genotyping after a positive screening test. Data are needed to support alternative colposcopic strategies based on vaccination status and on the application of artificial intelligence where the patient's risk stratification is implicit in precision medicine which involves the transition from an operator-dependent morphology-based to a less-operator dependent, more biomolecular management. The patient's risk stratification based on any combination of \"history\" and \"test results\" to decrease colposcopy workload further reduce colposcopic and histologic morphological approaches, while adding genotyping to the risk stratification paradigm means less cytologic morphologic diagnosis. In Italy, there is a strong colposcopic tradition and there is currently no immediate need to reduce the number of colposcopies. Instead, there is a need for more accredited colposcopists to maintain the diagnostic accuracy of colposcopy in the vaccination era.", "Expediting notification of lesions in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) is critical. Limited availability of experts to assess such lesions and delays in large vessel occlusion (LVO) recognition can negatively affect outcomes. Artificial intelligence (AI) may aid LVO recognition and treatment. This study aims to evaluate the performance of an AI-based algorithm for LVO detection in AIS.\nRetrospective analysis of a database of AIS patients admitted in a single center between 2014 and 2019. Vascular neurologists graded computed tomography angiographies (CTAs) for presence and site of LVO. Studies were analyzed by the Viz-LVO Algorithm\u00ae version 1.4 - neural network programmed to detect occlusions from the internal carotid artery terminus (ICA-T) to the Sylvian fissure. Comparisons between human versus AI-based readings were done by test characteristic analysis and Cohen's kappa. Primary analysis included ICA-T and/or middle cerebral artery (MCA)-M1 LVOs versus non-LVOs/more distal occlusions. Secondary analysis included MCA-M2 occlusions.\n610 CTAs were analyzed. The AI algorithm rejected 2.5% of the CTAs due to poor quality, which were excluded from the analysis. Viz-LVO identified ICA-T and MCA-M1 LVOs with a sensitivity of 87.6%, specificity of 88.5%, and accuracy of 87.9% (AUC 0.88, 95% CI: 0.85-0.92, p < 0.001). Cohen's kappa was 0.74. In the secondary analysis, the algorithm yielded a sensitivity of 80.3%, specificity of 88.5%, and accuracy of 82.7%. The mean run time of the algorithm was 2.78 \u00b1 0.5 min.\nAutomated AI reading allows for fast and accurate identification of LVO strokes with timely notification to emergency teams, enabling quick decision-making for reperfusion therapies or transfer to specialized centers if needed.", "Over the years, multiple biomarkers have been used to aid in disease screening, diagnosis, prognosis, and response to therapy. As of late, protein biomarkers are gaining strength in their role for early disease diagnosis and prognosis in part due to the advancements in identification and characterization of a distinct functional pool of proteins known as proteoforms. Proteoforms are defined as all of the different molecular forms of a protein derived from a single gene caused by genetic variations, alternative spliced RNA transcripts and post-translational modifications. Monitoring the structural changes of each proteoform of a particular protein is essential to elucidate the complex molecular mechanisms that guide the course of disease. Clinical proteomics therefore holds the potential to offer further insight into disease pathology, progression, and prevention. Nevertheless, more technologically advanced diagnostic methods are needed to improve the reliability and clinical applicability of proteomics in preventive medicine. In this manuscript, we review the use of immunoaffinity capillary electrophoresis (IACE) as an emerging powerful diagnostic tool to isolate, separate, detect and characterize proteoform biomarkers obtained from liquid biopsy. IACE is an affinity capture-separation technology capable of isolating, concentrating and analyzing a wide range of biomarkers present in biological fluids. Isolation and concentration of target analytes is accomplished through binding to one or more biorecognition affinity ligands immobilized to a solid support, while separation and analysis are achieved by high-resolution capillary electrophoresis (CE) coupled to one or more detectors. IACE has the potential to generate rapid results with significant accuracy, leading to reliability and reproducibility in diagnosing and monitoring disease. Additionally, IACE has the capability of monitoring the efficacy of therapeutic agents by quantifying companion and complementary protein biomarkers. With advancements in telemedicine and artificial intelligence, the implementation of proteoform biomarker detection and analysis may significantly improve our capacity to identify medical conditions early and intervene in ways that improve health outcomes for individuals and populations.", "The ORNATE India project is an interdisciplinary, multifaceted United Kingdom (UK)-India collaborative study aimed to build research capacity and capability in India and the UK to tackle the burden of diabetes-related visual impairment. For 51 months (October 2017-December 2021), this project built collaboration between six institutions in the UK and seven in India, including the Government of Kerala. Diabetic retinopathy (DR) screening models were evaluated in the public system in Kerala. An epidemiological study of diabetes and its complications was conducted through 20 centers across India covering 10 states and one union territory. The statistical analysis is not yet complete. In the UK, risk models for diabetes and its complications and artificial intelligence-aided tools are being developed. These were complemented by joint studies on various aspects of diabetes between collaborators in the UK and India. This interdisciplinary team enabled increased capability in several workstreams, resulting in an increased number of publications, development of cost-effective risk models, algorithms for risk-based screening, and policy for state-wide implementation of sustainable DR screening and treatment programs in primary care in Kerala. The increase in research capacity included multiple disciplines from field workers, administrators, project managers, project leads, screeners, graders, optometrists, nurses, general practitioners, and research associates in various disciplines. Cross-fertilization of these disciplines enabled the development of several collaborations external to this project. This collaborative project has made a significant impact on research capacity development in both India and the UK.", "One of the greatest strengths of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) approaches in health care is that their performance can be continually improved based on updates from automated learning from data. However, health care ML models are currently essentially regulated under provisions that were developed for an earlier age of slowly updated medical devices-requiring major documentation reshape and revalidation with every major update of the model generated by the ML algorithm. This creates minor problems for models that will be retrained and updated only occasionally, but major problems for models that will learn from data in real time or near real time. Regulators have announced action plans for fundamental changes in regulatory approaches. In this Viewpoint, we examine the current regulatory frameworks and developments in this domain. The status quo and recent developments are reviewed, and we argue that these innovative approaches to health care need matching innovative approaches to regulation and that these approaches will bring benefits for patients. International perspectives from the World Health Organization, and the Food and Drug Administration's proposed approach, based around oversight of tool developers' quality management systems and defined algorithm change protocols, offer a much-needed paradigm shift, and strive for a balanced approach to enabling rapid improvements in health care through AI innovation while simultaneously ensuring patient safety. The draft European Union (EU) regulatory framework indicates similar approaches, but no detail has yet been provided on how algorithm change protocols will be implemented in the EU. We argue that detail must be provided, and we describe how this could be done in a manner that would allow the full benefits of AI/ML-based innovation for EU patients and health care systems to be realized.", "Discussions of health issues on social media are a crucial information source reflecting real-world responses regarding events and opinions. They are often important in public health care, since these are influencing pathways that affect vaccination decision-making by hesitant individuals. Artificial intelligence methodologies based on internet search engine queries have been suggested to detect disease outbreaks and population behavior. Among social media, Twitter is a common platform of choice to search and share opinions and (mis)information about health care issues, including vaccination and vaccines.\nOur primary objective was to support the design and implementation of future eHealth strategies and interventions on social media to increase the quality of targeted communication campaigns and therefore increase influenza vaccination rates. Our goal was to define an artificial intelligence-based approach to elucidate how threads in Twitter on influenza vaccination changed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Such findings may support adapted vaccination campaigns and could be generalized to other health-related mass communications.\nThe study comprised the following 5 stages: (1) collecting tweets from Twitter related to influenza, vaccines, and vaccination in the United States; (2) data cleansing and storage using machine learning techniques; (3) identifying terms, hashtags, and topics related to influenza, vaccines, and vaccination; (4) building a dynamic folksonomy of the previously defined vocabulary (terms and topics) to support the understanding of its trends; and (5) labeling and evaluating the folksonomy.\nWe collected and analyzed 2,782,720 tweets of 420,617 unique users between December 30, 2019, and April 30, 2021. These tweets were in English, were from the United States, and included at least one of the following terms: \"flu,\" \"influenza,\" \"vaccination,\" \"vaccine,\" and \"vaxx.\" We noticed that the prevalence of the terms vaccine and vaccination increased over 2020, and that \"flu\" and \"covid\" occurrences were inversely correlated as \"flu\" disappeared over time from the tweets. By combining word embedding and clustering, we then identified a folksonomy built around the following 3 topics dominating the content of the collected tweets: \"health and medicine (biological and clinical aspects),\" \"protection and responsibility,\" and \"politics.\" By analyzing terms frequently appearing together, we noticed that the tweets were related mainly to COVID-19 pandemic events.\nThis study focused initially on vaccination against influenza and moved to vaccination against COVID-19. Infoveillance supported by machine learning on Twitter and other social media about topics related to vaccines and vaccination against communicable diseases and their trends can lead to the design of personalized messages encouraging targeted subpopulations' engagement in vaccination. A greater likelihood that a targeted population receives a personalized message is associated with higher response, engagement, and proactiveness of the target population for the vaccination process.", "As research on mind wandering has accelerated, the construct's defining features have expanded and researchers have begun to examine different dimensions of mind wandering. Recently, Christoff and colleagues have argued for the importance of investigating a hitherto neglected variety of mind wandering: \"unconstrained thought,\" or, thought that is relatively unguided by executive-control processes. To date, with only a few studies investigating unconstrained thought, little is known about this intriguing type of mind wandering. Across 2 experiments, we examined, for the first time, whether changes in task demand influence rates of constrained versus unconstrained thoughts. In both experiments, participants completed either an easy (0-back) or hard (2-back) task and responded to intermittently presented thought probes that gauged thought constraint throughout the task. In Experiment 1, we found that participants completing the easy task engaged in unconstrained thoughts more frequently than those completing the difficult task. In Experiment 2, we replicated this result and further demonstrated manipulations of unconstrained thought while also measuring task-relatedness (a common dimension of mind wandering). Finally, exploratory analyses showed associations between constrained thought and age, verbal intelligence, and an assessment of flow ('deep effortless concentration'), thereby adding further evidence to indicate a dissociation between task-relatedness and constraint. We discuss the methodological and theoretical applications of our findings to the burgeoning field of research on unconstrained thought.

However, detecting such caries using bitewing radiography is difficult and the subtle patterns are often missed by dental practitioners.Aims To investigate whether the ability of dentists to detect enamel-only proximal caries is enhanced by the use of AssistDent artificial intelligence (AI) software.Materials and methods In the ADEPT (AssistDent Enamel-only Proximal caries assessmenT) study, 23 dentists were randomly divided into a control arm, without AI assistance, and an experimental arm, in which AI assistance provided on-screen prompts indicating potential enamel-only proximal caries. All participants analysed a set of 24 bitewings in which an expert panel had previously identified 65 enamel-only carious lesions and 241 healthy proximal surfaces.Results The control group found 44.3% of the caries, whereas the experimental group found 75.8%. The experimental group incorrectly identified caries in 14.6% of the healthy surfaces compared to 3.7% in the control group. The increase in sensitivity of 71% and decrease in specificity of 11% are statistically significant (p <0.01).Conclusions AssistDent AI software significantly improves dentists' ability to detect enamel-only proximal caries and could be considered as a tool to support preventive dentistry in general practice.", "Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is a significant burden, particularly among patients with severe disease requiring invasive treatment. We applied a general Machine Learning (ML) workflow and investigated if a multi-dimensional marker set of standard clinical parameters can identify patients in need of vascular intervention without specialized intra-hospital diagnostics.\nThis is a retrospective study involving patients with stable PAD (sPAD, Fontaine Class I and II, n = 38) and unstable PAD (unPAD, Fontaine Class III and IV, n = 18) in need of invasive therapeutic measures. ML algorithms such as Random Forest were utilized to evaluate a matrix consisting of multiple routinely clinically available parameters (age, complete blood count, inflammation, lipid, iron metabolism).\nML has enabled a generation of an Artificial Intelligence (AI) PAD score (AI-PAD) that successfully divided sPAD from unPAD patients (high AI-PAD in sPAD, low AI-PAD in unPAD, cutoff at 50 AI-PAD units). Furthermore, the probability score positively coincided with gold-standard intra-hospital mean ankle-brachial index (ABI).\nAI-based tools may be promising to enable the correct identification of patients with unstable PAD by using existing clinical information, thus supplementing clinical decision making. Additional studies in larger prospective cohorts are necessary to determine the usefulness of this approach in comparison to standard diagnostic measures.", "The European Union (EU) has a strong reputation and track record for the development of guidelines for the ethical use of artificial intelligence (AI) generally. In this paper, we discuss the development of an AI and ethical framework by the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA), for the European insurance market. EIOPA's earlier report on big data analytics (EIOPA, 2019) provided a foundation to analyze the complex range of issues associated with AI being deployed in insurance, such as behavioral insurance, parametric products, novel pricing and risk assessment algorithms, e-service, and claims management. The paper presents an overview of AI in insurance applications throughout the insurance value chain. A general discussion of ethics, AI, and insurance is provided, and a new hierarchical model is presented that describes insurance as a complex system that can be analyzed by taking a layered, multi-level approach that maps ethical issues directly to specific level(s).", "Chest X-rays (CXR) and computed tomography (CT) are the main medical imaging modalities used against the increased worldwide spread of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) epidemic. Machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) technology, based on medical imaging fully extracting and utilizing the hidden information in massive medical imaging data, have been used in COVID-19 research of disease diagnosis and classification, treatment decision-making, efficacy evaluation, and prognosis prediction. This review article describes the extensive research of medical image-based ML and AI methods in preventing and controlling COVID-19, and summarizes their characteristics, differences, and significance in terms of application direction, image collection, and algorithm improvement, from the perspective of radiologists. The limitations and challenges faced by these systems and technologies, such as generalization and robustness, are discussed to indicate future research directions.", "Coronavirus (COVID-19), a deadly pandemic has spread worldwide and created many global health issues. Though methods of its detection are being continuously developed for the early detection and monitoring of COVID-19, still there is need for more novel methods. The presently used methods include rapid antigen tests, serological surveys, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), artificial intelligence-based techniques, and assays based on sensors/biosensors. Of all these, RT-PCR test has high sensitivity and specificity though it requires more time for testing and need for skilled technicians. Recently, electrochemical sensors have been developed for rapid monitoring and detection of SARS-CoV-2 from the patient's biological fluid samples. This review covers the recently developed electrochemical sensors that are focused on the detection of viral nucleic acid, immunoglobulin, antigen, and the entire viral particles. In addition, we also compare and assess their detection limits, sensitivities and specificities for the identification and monitoring of COVID-19. Furthermore, this review will address the best practices for the development of electrochemical sensors such as electrode fouling, limit of detection/limit of quantification determination and verification.", "To evaluate neurodevelopmental status among children with inherited cholestatic liver diseases with native liver and variables predictive of impairment.\nParticipants with Alagille syndrome (ALGS), progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC), and alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency (A1AT) enrolled in a longitudinal, multicenter study and completed the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence-III or Intelligence Scale for Children-IV. Full Scale Intelligence Quotient (FSIQ) was analyzed continuously and categorically (>100, 85-99, 70-84, <70). Univariate linear regression was performed to study association between FSIQ and risk factors, stratified by disease.\nTwo hundred and fifteen completed testing (ALGS n\u200a=\u200a70, PFIC n\u200a=\u200a43, A1AT n\u200a=\u200a102); median age was 7.6\u200ayears (3.0-16.9). Mean FSIQ in ALGS was lower than A1AT (94 vs 101, P\u200a=\u200a0.01). Frequency of FSIQ\u200a<\u200a85 (>1 standard deviation [SD] below average) was highest in ALGS (29%) versus 18.6% in PFIC and 12.8% in A1AT, and was greater than expected in ALGS based on normal distribution (29% vs 15.9%, P\u200a=\u200a0.003). ALGS scored significantly lower than test norms in almost all Wechsler composites; A1AT scored lower on Working Memory and Processing Speed; PFIC was not different from test norms. Total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, albumin, hemoglobin, and parental education were significantly associated with FSIQ.\nPatients with ALGS are at increased risk of lower FSIQ, whereas our data suggest A1AT and PFIC are not. A1AT and ALGS appear vulnerable to working memory and processing speed deficits suggestive of attention/executive function impairment. Malnutrition, liver disease severity, and sociodemographic factors appear related to FSIQ deficits, potentially identifying targets for early interventions.", "The Medical Intelligence and Information (MI2) Unit of the German Armed Forces (Bundeswehr) is experienced in crisis support in military missions since several years. It gained additional experiences during the current coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on different levels of the response to crisis and was requested to share the findings and expertise with the overloaded civil public health agencies inside Germany. Since the beginning of the pandemic, the unit is constantly developing new products for crisis communication, knowledge sharing techniques in new databases, dashboards for leadership, and training for laypersons in contact tracing. Hence, trying to innovate in crisis since the first severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-2-disease wave. During the second wave, the unit was requested to evaluate the outbreak management of different national civil public health agencies in southern Germany, and to support the development of dashboards in a comprehensive public health approach as a necessary start toward digitalization.", "This commentary\u00a0article focuses on the emergence of synthetic media-computer-generated content that is created by employing Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies. It discusses three of the most notable\u00a0current forms of this emerging form of content: deepfakes, virtual influencers, and augmented and virtual reality (collectively known as extended reality). Their key features are introduced, and the main challenges and opportunities associated with the technologies are analysed. In all cases, a crucial change is underway: reality (or, at least, the perception thereof) is seen as increasingly less stable, and potential for manipulation is on the rise. In fact, it transpires that personalisation of (perceived) reality is the likely outcome, with increasing societal fragmentation as a result. Mediatisation is used as a broad-ranging metatheory that explains the permeation by media of everyday affairs to explain the degree of impact that synthetic media have on the society. In this context, it is suggested that we search for new and alternative criteria for reality that would be capable of accounting for the changing nature of agency and impact in today's world.", "Breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the most sensitive imaging modality for breast cancer diagnosis and is widely used clinically. Dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI is the basis for breast MRI, but ultrafast images, T2-weighted images, and diffusion-weighted images are also taken to improve the characteristics of the lesion. Such multiparametric MRI with numerous morphological and functional data poses new challenges to radiologists, and thus, new tools for reliable, reproducible, and high-volume quantitative assessments are warranted. In this context, radiomics, which is an emerging field of research involving the conversion of digital medical images into mineable data for clinical decision-making and outcome prediction, has been gaining ground in oncology. Recent development in artificial intelligence has promoted radiomics studies in various fields including breast cancer treatment and numerous studies have been conducted. However, radiomics has shown a translational gap in clinical practice, and many issues remain to be solved. In this review, we will outline the steps of radiomics workflow and investigate clinical application of radiomics focusing on breast MRI based on published literature, as well as current discussion about limitations and challenges in radiomics.", "Objective.With the development in the field of neural networks,explainable AI(XAI), is being studied to ensure that artificial intelligence models can be explained. There are some attempts to apply neural networks to neuroscientific studies to explain neurophysiological information with high machine learning performances. However, most of those studies have simply visualized features extracted from XAI and seem to lack an active neuroscientific interpretation of those features. In this study, we have tried to actively explain the high-dimensional learning features contained in the neurophysiological information extracted from XAI, compared with the previously reported neuroscientific results.Approach. We designed a deep neural network classifier using 3D information (3D DNN) and a 3D class activation map (3D CAM) to visualize high-dimensional classification features. We used those tools to classify monkey electrocorticogram (ECoG) data obtained from the unimanual and bimanual movement experiment.Main results. The 3D DNN showed better classification accuracy than other machine learning techniques, such as 2D DNN. Unexpectedly, the activation weight in the 3D CAM analysis was high in the ipsilateral motor and somatosensory cortex regions, whereas the gamma-band power was activated in the contralateral areas during unimanual movement, which suggests that the brain signal acquired from the motor cortex contains information about both contralateral movement and ipsilateral movement. Moreover, the hand-movement classification system used critical temporal information at movement onset and offset when classifying bimanual movements.Significance.As far as we know, this is the first study to use high-dimensional neurophysiological information (spatial, spectral, and temporal) with the deep learning method, reconstruct those features, and explain how the neural network works. We expect that our methods can be widely applied and used in neuroscience and electrophysiology research from the point of view of the explainability of XAI as well as its performance.", "Turkish civil code permits child marriages at 16-17 years of age, but if a child is 16 years old judicial consent is needed. Before making a final decision on marriage consent, the judges refer these children to the doctor, and ask whether they are psychologically and physically ready for marriage. While the literature on child marriage in Turkey is rich, little is known about the underlying factors leading 16-year-old girls to request legal child marriage. This study examined the socio-demographic and clinical characteristics of girls applying to the courts for judicial marriage consent. Hospital records of girls admitted to a hospital in the Istanbul province of Turkey between January 2015 and December 2018 for the assessment of their physical and mental readiness for marriage were scanned. Of the 122 girls admitted to hospital for this purpose, eight were excluded as they had incomplete data, leaving 114 participating girls. All girls were Turkish citizens and had been referred from the law courts. Being pregnant/having a child (54.4%), having had a religious (non-legal) marriage (49.1%) and having an intelligence score of less than 90 (91.2%) were common among the participants. Among those who had a religious marriage, 78.6% were pregnant/had a child at the time of evaluation and 32.1% reported that they were pregnant before their religious marriage took place. None of the participants reported being forced to marry, but many had run away from home to marry (33.3%). Among those running away to marry, the major reason for deciding to do this was being pregnant (63.2%). Running away from home to marry was found to be related to lower parental educational levels (p<0.05). Contrary to the literature, the findings indicate that girls who request judicial consent for legal child marriage in Turkey are not being forced to marry. However, lower educational level seems to be an important factor. Below-average intelligence of the girl and her parents, running away from home to marry and early unsafe sexual intercourse, leading to child pregnancy, were found to be closely associated with legal child marriage in Turkey.", "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common tachyarrhythmia and associated with a risk of stroke. The detection and diagnosis of AF represent a major clinical challenge due to AF's asymptomatic and intermittent nature. Novel consumer-grade mobile health (mHealth) products with automatic arrhythmia detection could be an option for long-term electrocardiogram (ECG)-based rhythm monitoring and AF detection.\nWe evaluated the feasibility and accuracy of a wearable automated mHealth arrhythmia monitoring system, including a consumer-grade, single-lead heart rate belt ECG device (heart belt), a mobile phone application, and a cloud service with an artificial intelligence (AI) arrhythmia detection algorithm for AF detection. The specific aim of this proof-of-concept study was to test the feasibility of the entire sequence of operations from ECG recording to AI arrhythmia analysis and ultimately to final AF detection.\nPatients (n=159) with an AF (n=73) or sinus rhythm (n=86) were recruited from the emergency department. A single-lead heart belt ECG was recorded for 24 hours. Simultaneously registered 3-lead ECGs (Holter) served as the gold standard for the final rhythm diagnostics and as a reference device in a user experience survey with patients over 65 years of age (high-risk group).\nThe heart belt provided a high-quality ECG recording for visual interpretation resulting in 100% accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of AF detection. The accuracy of AF detection with the automatic AI arrhythmia detection from the heart belt ECG recording was also high (97.5%), and the sensitivity and specificity were 100% and 95.4%, respectively. The correlation between the automatic estimated AF burden and the true AF burden from Holter recording was >0.99 with a mean burden error of 0.05 (SD 0.26) hours. The heart belt demonstrated good user experience and did not significantly interfere with the patient's daily activities. The patients preferred the heart belt over Holter ECG for rhythm monitoring (85/110, 77% heart belt vs 77/109, 71% Holter, P=.049).\nA consumer-grade, single-lead ECG heart belt provided good-quality ECG for rhythm diagnosis. The mHealth arrhythmia monitoring system, consisting of heart-belt ECG, a mobile phone application, and an automated AF detection achieved AF detection with high accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. In addition, the mHealth arrhythmia monitoring system showed good user experience.\nClinicalTrials.gov NCT03507335; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03507335.", "No one knows what the paradigm shift of artificial intelligence will bring to medical imaging. In this article, we attempt to predict how artificial intelligence will impact radiology based on a critical review of current innovations. The best way to predict the future is to anticipate, prepare, and create it. We anticipate that radiology will need to enhance current infrastructure, collaborate with others, learn the challenges and pitfalls of the technology, and maintain a healthy skepticism about artificial intelligence while embracing its potential to allow us to become more productive, accurate, secure, and impactful in the care of our patients.", "The drivers of critical coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) remain unknown. Given major confounding factors such as age and comorbidities, true mediators of this condition have remained elusive. We used a multi-omics analysis combined with artificial intelligence in a young patient cohort where major comorbidities were excluded at the onset. The cohort included 47 \u201ccritical\u201d (in the intensive care unit under mechanical ventilation) and 25 \u201cnon-critical\u201d (in a non-critical care ward) patients with COVID-19 and 22 healthy individuals. The analyses included whole-genome sequencing, whole-blood RNA sequencing, plasma and blood mononuclear cell proteomics, cytokine profiling, and high-throughput immunophenotyping. An ensemble of machine learning, deep learning, quantum annealing, and structural causal modeling were used. Patients with critical COVID-19 were characterized by exacerbated inflammation, perturbed lymphoid and myeloid compartments, increased coagulation, and viral cell biology. Among differentially expressed genes, we observed up-regulation of the metalloprotease ADAM9. This gene signature was validated in a second independent cohort of 81 critical and 73 recovered patients with COVID-19 and was further confirmed at the transcriptional and protein level and by proteolytic activity. Ex vivo ADAM9 inhibition decreased severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) uptake and replication in human lung epithelial cells. In conclusion, within a young, otherwise healthy, cohort of individuals with COVID-19, we provide the landscape of biological perturbations in vivo where a unique gene signature differentiated critical from non-critical patients. We further identified ADAM9 as a driver of disease severity and a candidate therapeutic target.", "Sensors based on conductive hydrogels have received extensive attention in various fields, such as artificial intelligence, electronic skin, and health monitoring. However, the poor resilience and fatigue resistance, icing, and water loss of traditional hydrogels greatly limit their application. Herein, an ionic conductive organohydrogel (PAC-Zn) was prepared for the first time by copolymerization of cardanol and acrylic acid in water/1,3-butanediol as a binary solvent system. A very small amount of cardanol (1% cardanol of total monomers) could not only significantly improve the tensile strength (\u223c4 times) and toughness (\u223c3 times) of PAA but also improve its extensibility. Due to the presence of 1,3-butanediol, PAC-Zn showed outstanding tolerance for freezing (-45 \u00b0C) and drying (over 85% moisture retention after 15 days of storage in a 37 \u00b0C oven). Compared with ethylene glycol and glycerol as antifreeze agents used in organohydrogels, the addition of 1,3-butanediol endowed the organohydrogel with not only similar frost resistance but also better mechanical performance. Besides, PAC-Zn exhibited fast resilience (almost no hysteresis loop) and excellent antifatigue ability. More importantly, a PAC-Zn organohydrogel-based sensor could detect human motion in real time (wrist, elbow, finger, and knee joints), revealing its fast response, good sensitivity, and stable electromechanical repeatability. In conclusion, the multifunctional PAC-Zn organohydrogel is expected to become a potential and promising candidate in the field of strain sensors under a broad range of environmental temperatures.", "This article describes a methodology for detailed mapping of the lignification capacity of plant cell walls that we have called \"REPRISAL\" for REPorter Ratiometrics Integrating Segmentation for Analyzing Lignification. REPRISAL consists of the combination of three separate approaches. In the first approach, H*, G*, and S* monolignol chemical reporters, corresponding to p-coumaryl alcohol, coniferyl alcohol, and sinapyl alcohol, are used to label the growing lignin polymer in a fluorescent triple labeling strategy based on the sequential use of three main bioorthogonal chemical reactions. In the second step, an automatic parametric and/or artificial intelligence segmentation algorithm is developed that assigns fluorescent image pixels to three distinct cell wall zones corresponding to cell corners, compound middle lamella and secondary cell walls. The last step corresponds to the exploitation of a ratiometric approach enabling statistical analyses of differences in monolignol reporter distribution (ratiometric method [RM] 1) and proportions (RM 2) within the different cell wall zones. We first describe the use of this methodology to map developmentally related changes in the lignification capacity of wild-type Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) interfascicular fiber cells. We then apply REPRISAL to analyze the Arabidopsis peroxidase (PRX) mutant prx64 and provide further evidence for the implication of the AtPRX64 protein in floral stem lignification. In addition, we also demonstrate the general applicability of REPRISAL by using it to map lignification capacity in poplar (Populus tremula \u00d7 Populus alba), flax (Linum usitatissimum), and maize (Zea mays). Finally, we show that the methodology can be used to map the incorporation of a fucose reporter into noncellulosic cell wall polymers.", "Pesticides are commonly used in modern agriculture and are important for global food security. However, postapplication losses due to degradation, photolysis, evaporation, leaching, surface runoff, and other processes may substantially reduce their efficacy. Controlled-release formulations can achieve the permeation-regulated transfer of an active ingredient from a reservoir to a target surface. Thus, they can maintain an active ingredient at a predetermined concentration for a specified period. This can reduce degradation and dissipation and other losses and has the potential to improve efficacy. Recent developments in controlled-release technology have adapted the concepts of intelligence and precision from the pharmaceutical industry. In this review, we present recent advances in the development of controlled-release formulations and discuss details of the preparation methods, material improvements, and application technologies.", "Introduction of a new drug to the market is a challenging and resource-consuming process. Predictive models developed with the use of artificial intelligence could be the solution to the growing need for an efficient tool which brings practical and knowledge benefits, but requires a large amount of high-quality data. The aim of our project was to develop quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) model predicting serotonergic activity toward the 5-HT1A receptor on the basis of a created database. The dataset was obtained using ZINC and ChEMBL databases. It contained 9440 unique compounds, yielding the largest available database of 5-HT1A ligands with specified pKi value to date. Furthermore, the predictive model was developed using automated machine learning (AutoML) methods. According to the 10-fold cross-validation (10-CV) testing procedure, the root-mean-squared error (RMSE) was 0.5437, and the coefficient of determination (R2) was 0.74. Moreover, the Shapley Additive Explanations method (SHAP) was applied to assess a more in-depth understanding of the influence of variables on the model's predictions. According to to the problem definition, the developed model can efficiently predict the affinity value for new molecules toward the 5-HT1A receptor on the basis of their structure encoded in the form of molecular descriptors. Usage of this model in screening processes can significantly improve the process of discovery of new drugs in the field of mental diseases and anticancer therapy.", "Normative approaches have been developed with the aim of providing high-quality methods and strict criteria that, when applied correctly, lead to reliable results. Standards, specifications, and guidelines are needed to facilitate exchange of goods or information and secure comparability of data derived from different laboratories and sources. They are available along the whole flow from study development to test selection, study conduct, and reporting and are widely used for the evaluation of medical devices, market approval, and harmonization of terms and devices. Standards are developed by specific national and international organizations or by dedicated interest groups, mainly scientists in their respective fields. ISO (International Organization for Standardization) standards are developed following stringent regulations, and groups of experts formulate such standards. They should come from different areas (multistakeholder approach) to have as much and as broad input as possible and to avoid single-interest dominance. However, the presence of academia in such groups has been comparatively low. There is a clear need and responsibility of the oral health community to participate in the development of normative documents to provide methodological knowledge and experience, balance the interests of other stakeholders, and finally improve oral health. This will help to ensure that rapidly advancing fields of research, such as the oral health impacts of COVID-19 or the application of artificial intelligence in dentistry, benefit from standardization of approaches and reporting.", "After three decades, more than 75,000 publications, tens of companies being involved in its commercialization, and a global market perspective of about USD 1.5 billion in 2023, optical coherence tomography (OCT) has become one of the fastest successfully translated imaging techniques with substantial clinical and economic impacts and acceptance.\nOur perspective focuses on disruptive forward-looking innovations and key technologies to further boost OCT performance and therefore enable significantly enhanced medical diagnosis.\nA comprehensive review of state-of-the-art accomplishments in OCT has been performed.\nThe most disruptive future OCT innovations include imaging resolution and speed (single-beam raster scanning versus parallelization) improvement, new implementations for dual modality or even multimodality systems, and using endogenous or exogenous contrast in these hybrid OCT systems targeting molecular and metabolic imaging. Aside from OCT angiography, no other functional or contrast enhancing OCT extension has accomplished comparable clinical and commercial impacts. Some more recently developed extensions, e.g., optical coherence elastography, dynamic contrast OCT, optoretinography, and artificial intelligence enhanced OCT are also considered with high potential for the future. In addition, OCT miniaturization for portable, compact, handheld, and/or cost-effective capsule-based OCT applications, home-OCT, and self-OCT systems based on micro-optic assemblies or photonic integrated circuits will revolutionize new applications and availability in the near future. Finally, clinical translation of OCT including medical device regulatory challenges will continue to be absolutely essential.\nWith its exquisite non-invasive, micrometer resolution depth sectioning capability, OCT has especially revolutionized ophthalmic diagnosis and hence is the fastest adopted imaging technology in the history of ophthalmology. Nonetheless, OCT has not been completely exploited and has substantial growth potential-in academics as well as in industry. This applies not only to the ophthalmic application field, but also especially to the original motivation of OCT to enable optical biopsy, i.e., the in situ imaging of tissue microstructure with a resolution approaching that of histology but without the need for tissue excision.", "This study aimed to develop a diagnostic support tool using pretrained models for classifying panoramic images of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) into normal and osteoarthritis (OA) cases.\nA total of 858 panoramic images of the TMJ (395 normal and 463\u00a0TMJ-OA) were obtained from 518 individuals from January 2015 to December 2018. The data were randomly divided into training, validation, and testing sets (6:2:2). We used pretrained Resnet152 and EfficientNet-B7 as transfer learning models. The accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, area under the curve, and gradient-weighted class activation mapping (grad-CAM) of both trained models were evaluated. The performances of the trained models were compared to that of dentists (both TMD specialists and general dentists).\nThe classification accuracies of ResNet-152 and EfficientNet-B7 were 0.87 and 0.88, respectively. The trained models exhibited the highest accuracy in OA classification. In the grad-CAM analysis, the trained models focused on specific areas in osteoarthritis images where erosion or osteophyte were observed.\nThe artificial intelligence model improved the diagnostic power of TMJ-OA when trained with two-dimensional panoramic condyle images and can be effectively applied by dentists as a screening diagnostic tool for TMJ-OA.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms govern in subtle yet fundamental ways the way we live and are transforming our societies. The promise of efficient, low-cost, or \"neutral\" solutions harnessing the potential of big data has led public bodies to adopt algorithmic systems in the provision of public services. As AI algorithms have permeated high-stakes aspects of our public existence-from hiring and education decisions to the governmental use of enforcement powers (policing) or liberty-restricting decisions (bail and sentencing)-this necessarily raises important accountability questions: What accountability challenges do AI algorithmic systems bring with them, and how can we safeguard accountability in algorithmic decision-making? Drawing on a decidedly public administration perspective, and given the current challenges that have thus far become manifest in the field, we critically reflect on and map out in a conceptually guided manner the implications of these systems, and the limitations they pose, for public accountability.", "Machine learning (ML) and Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to dramatically improve radiology practice at multiple stages of the imaging pipeline. Most of the attention has been garnered by applications focused on improving the end of the pipeline: image interpretation. However, this article reviews how AI/ML can be applied to improve upstream components of the imaging pipeline, including exam modality selection, hardware design, exam protocol selection, data acquisition, image reconstruction, and image processing. A breadth of applications and their potential for impact is shown across multiple imaging modalities, including ultrasound, computed tomography, and MRI.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) has an astonishing potential in assisting clinical decision making and revolutionizing the field of health care. A major open challenge that AI will need to address before its integration in the clinical routine is that of algorithmic bias. Most AI algorithms need big datasets to learn from, but several groups of the human population have a long history of being absent or misrepresented in existing biomedical datasets. If the training data is misrepresentative of the population variability, AI is prone to reinforcing bias, which can lead to fatal outcomes, misdiagnoses, and lack of generalization. Here, we describe the challenges in rendering AI algorithms fairer, and we propose concrete steps for addressing bias using tools from the field of open science.", "In order to explore the application of artificial neural network in rehabilitation evaluation, a kind of ANN stable and reliable artificial intelligence algorithm is proposed. By learning the existing clinical gait data, this method extracted the gait characteristic parameters of patients with different ages, disease types and course of disease, and repeated data iteration and finally simulated the corresponding gait parameters of patients. Experiments showed that the trained ANN had the same score as the human for most of the data (82.2%, Cohen's kappa\u2009=\u20090.743). There was a strong correlation between ANN and improved Ashworth scores as assessed by human raters (r\u2009=\u20090.825, P < 0.01). As a stable and reliable artificial intelligence algorithm, ANN can provide new ideas and methods for clinical rehabilitation evaluation.", "Most of the studies of the effects of fluid intelligence and non-cognitive characteristics on crystalized intelligence examined additive effects. The results of the few studies that examined interactive effects are inconsistent. Some find a positive (facilitating) interaction and some find a negative (compensatory) interaction. We improve on these previous studies by examining non-cognitive characteristics that were not studied before and by using a very large representative sample (n = 11,266). We find a positive/facilitating interaction. We discuss the implication of these results to theories about the joint effect of fluid intelligence and non-cognitive characteristics on crystalized intelligence.", "This article gives a brief overview of the development of artificial intelligence in clinical breast imaging. For multiple decades, artificial intelligence (AI) methods have been developed and translated for breast imaging tasks such as detection, diagnosis, and assessing response to therapy. As imaging modalities arise to support breast cancer screening programs and diagnostic examinations, including full-field digital mammography, breast tomosynthesis, ultrasound, and MRI, AI techniques parallel the efforts with more complex algorithms, faster computers, and larger data sets. AI methods include human-engineered radiomics algorithms and deep learning methods. Examples of these AI-supported clinical tasks are given along with commentary on the future.", "The aims of this study were, for pediatric cochlear implant (CI) recipients, (a) to determine the effect of age on their spectral modulation detection (SMD) ability and compare their age effect to that of their typically hearing (TH) peers; (b) to identify demographic, cognitive, and audiological factors associated with SMD ability; and (c) to determine the unique contribution of SMD ability to segmental and suprasegmental speech perception performance.\nA total of 104 pediatric CI recipients and 38 TH peers (ages 6-11 years) completed a test of SMD. CI recipients completed tests of segmental (e.g., word recognition in noise and vowels and consonants in quiet) and suprasegmental (e.g., talker discrimination, stress discrimination, and emotion identification) perception, nonverbal intelligence, and working memory. Regressions analyses were used to examine the effects of group and age on percent-correct SMD scores. For the CI group, the effects of demographic, audiological, and cognitive variables on SMD performance and the effects of SMD on speech perception were examined.\nThe TH group performed significantly better than the CI group on SMD. Both groups showed better performance with increasing age. Significant predictors of SMD performance for the CI group were age and nonverbal intelligence. SMD performance predicted significant variance in segmental and suprasegmental perception. The variance predicted by SMD performance was nearly double for suprasegmental than for segmental perception.\nChildren in the CI group, on average, scored lower than their TH peers. The slopes of improvement in SMD with age did not differ between the groups. The significant effect of nonverbal intelligence on SMD performance in CI recipients indicates that difficulties inherent in the task affect outcomes. SMD ability predicted speech perception scores, with a more prominent role in suprasegmental than in segmental speech perception. SMD ability may provide a useful nonlinguistic tool for predicting speech perception benefit, with cautious interpretation based on age and cognitive function.", "BACKGROUND: Patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA) can be treated with a range of targeted therapies following inadequate response to conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs such as methotrexate. Whereas clinical practice guidelines provide no formal recommendations for initial targeted therapies, the tumor necrosis factor alpha inhibitor (TNFi) class is the prevalent first-line selection based on clinician experience, its safety profile, and/or formulary requirements, while also being the costliest. Most patients do not achieve adequate clinical response with a first-line TNFi, however. A molecular signature response classifier (MSRC) test that assesses RA-related biomarkers can identify patients who are unlikely to achieve adequate response to TNFi-class therapies. OBJECTIVE: To model cost-effectiveness of MSRC-guided, first-line targeted therapy selection compared with current standard care. METHODS: This budget impact analysis used data sourced from August to September 2020. The prevalence of each first-line targeted therapy was obtained using market intelligence from Datamonitor/Informa PLC Rheumatology Dashboard Forecast 2020, and the average first-year cost of treatment for each class was calculated using wholesale acquisition costs from IBM Micromedex RED BOOK Online. Average effectiveness for each class was based on manufacturer-reported ACR50 response rates (American College of Rheumatology adequate response criteria of 50% improvement at 6 months after therapy initiation). The impact of MSRC testing on first therapy selection was predicted based on a third party-generated decision-impact study that analyzed potential alterations in rheumatologist prescribing patterns after receiving MSRC test reports. Sensitivity analysis evaluated potential impacts of variation in first-year medication cost, adherence to MSRC report, and test price on the first-year cost of treatment. Cost for response (first-year therapy cost therapy divided by probability of achieving ACR50) was compared between standard care and MSRC-guided care. RESULTS: The estimated cost for first-year, standard-care treatment was $65,117, with 80% of patients initiating treatment with a TNFi. Cost for achieving ACR50 response was $177,046. After applying MSRC-guided patient stratification and therapy selection, the first-year cost was $56,543, net of test price, with 49.0% of patients initiating with a TNFi. First-year MSRC-guided care cost, including test price, was estimated at $117,103, a 33.9% improvement over standard care. Sensitivity analysis showed a net cost improvement for guided care vs standard care across all scenarios. Patients predicted to be inadequate TNFi responders, when modeled with lower-priced alternatives, were predicted to show increased ACR50 response rates. Those with MSRC test results indicating a first-line TNFi were predicted to show an ACR50 response rate superior to that for any other class. In this model, if implemented clinically, MSRC-guided care might save the US health care system more than $850 million annually and improve ACR50 by up to 31.3%. CONCLUSIONS: Precision medicine using MSRC-guided patient stratification and therapy selection may both decrease cost and improve efficacy of targeted RA therapies.

The study starts from the highlights of a companion paper. Objective: The aim was to investigate the consensus and acceptance of the insiders on this issue. Procedure: An electronic survey based on the standardized package Microsoft Forms (Microsoft, Redmond, WA, USA) was proposed to a sample of biomedical laboratory technicians (149 admitted in the study, 76 males, 73 females, mean age 44.2 years). Results: The survey showed no criticality. It highlighted (a) the good perception of the basic training on both groups, and (b) a uniformly low perceived knowledge of AI (as arisen from the graded questions). Expectations, perceived general impact, perceived changes in the work-flow, and worries clearly emerged in the study. Conclusions: The of AI in DP is an unstoppable process, as well as the increase of the digitalization in the health domain. Stakeholders must not look with suspicion towards AI, which can represent an important resource, but should invest in monitoring and consensus training initiatives based also on electronic surveys.", "Voltage collapse tends to occur due to the voltage instability created during large faults. As a last resort, under-voltage load shedding (UVLS) is performed after all the available power operation and control mechanisms have been exhausted. Load shedding techniques have advanced from the conventional and adaptive methods that are less optimal compared to computational intelligence-based techniques. Recent works have identified hybrid algorithms to give more optimal solutions for UVLS problems with multi-objective functions. In this paper, a novel hybrid ABC-PSO algorithm, adapted from a software estimation project, is used to perform UVLS on a modified IEEE 14-bus system. Eight overload conditions are imposed on the system ranging from 105% to 140% loading, where FVSI ranking is used in identifying weak buses. The load shedding is then performed following decentralized relay settings of 3.5 seconds, 5 seconds and 8 seconds, which gives an overall 99.32% recovery of voltage profiles. The proposed hybrid ABC-PSO algorithm is able to shed optimal amounts of load, giving an 89.56% post-contingency load, compared to GA's 77.04%, ABC-ANN at 84.03% and PSO-ANN at 80.96%. This study has been simulated on MATLAB software, using the Power System Analysis Toolbox (PSAT) graphical user and command-line interfaces.", "In the era of artificial intelligence and precision medicine, the use of quantitative imaging methodological approaches could improve the cancer patient's therapeutic approaches. Specifically, our pilot study aims to explore whether CT texture features on both baseline and first post-treatment contrast-enhanced CT may act as a predictor of overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) in metastatic melanoma (MM) patients treated with the PD-1 inhibitor Nivolumab. Ninety-four lesions from 32 patients treated with Nivolumab were analyzed. Manual segmentation was performed using a free-hand polygon approach by drawing a region of interest (ROI) around each target lesion (up to five lesions were selected per patient according to RECIST 1.1). Filtration-histogram-based texture analysis was employed using a commercially available research software called TexRAD (Feedback Medical Ltd, London, UK; https://fbkmed.com/texrad-landing-2/) Percentage changes in texture features were calculated to perform delta-radiomics analysis. Texture feature kurtosis at fine and medium filter scale predicted OS and PFS. A higher kurtosis is correlated with good prognosis; kurtosis values greater than 1.11 for SSF = 2 and 1.20 for SSF = 3 were indicators of higher OS (fine texture: 192 HR = 0.56, 95% CI = 0.32-0.96, p = 0.03; medium texture: HR = 0.54, 95% CI = 0.29-0.99, p = 0.04) and PFS (fine texture: HR = 0.53, 95% CI = 0.29-0.95, p = 0.03; medium texture: HR = 0.49, 209 95% CI = 0.25-0.96, p = 0.03). In delta-radiomics analysis, the entropy percentage variation correlated with OS and PFS. Increasing entropy indicates a worse outcome. An entropy variation greater than 5% was an indicator of bad prognosis. CT delta-texture analysis quantified as entropy predicted OS and PFS. Baseline CT texture quantified as kurtosis also predicted survival baseline. Further studies with larger cohorts are mandatory to confirm these promising exploratory results.", "Rapid advances in machine learning and related techniques have increased optimism about self-driving cars, autonomous surgery, and other uses of artificial intelligence (AI). But adoption of these technologies is not simply a matter of breakthroughs in the design and training of algorithms. Regulators around the world will have to make a litany of choices about law and policy surrounding AI. To advance knowledge of how they will make these choices, we draw on a unique survey pool-690 local officials in the United States-a representative sample of U.S. local officials. These officials will make many of the decisions about AI adoption, from government use to regulation, given the decentralized structure of the United States. The results show larger levels of support for autonomous vehicles than autonomous surgery. Moreover, those that used ridesharing apps prior to the COVID-19 pandemic are significantly more supportive of autonomous vehicles. We also find that self-reported familiarity with AI is correlated with increased approval of AI uses in a variety of areas, including facial recognition, natural disaster impact planning, and even military surveillance. Related, those who expressed greater opposition to AI adoption also appear more concerned about trade-offs between privacy and information and bias in algorithms. Finally, the explanatory logic used by respondents varies based on gender and prior experience with AI, which we demonstrate with quantitative text analysis.", "The new 'normal' defined during the COVID-19 pandemic has forced us to re-assess how people with special needs thrive in these unprecedented conditions, such as those with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). These changing/challenging conditions have instigated us to revisit the usage of telehealth services to improve the quality of life for people with ASD. This study aims to identify mobile applications that suit the needs of such individuals. This work focuses on identifying features of a number of highly-rated mobile applications (apps) that are designed to assist people with ASD, specifically those features that use Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies. In this study, 250 mobile apps have been retrieved using keywords such as autism, autism AI, and autistic. Among 250 apps, 46 were identified after filtering out irrelevant apps based on defined elimination criteria such as ASD common users, medical staff, and non-medically trained people interacting with people with ASD. In order to review common functionalities and features, 25 apps were downloaded and analysed based on eye tracking, facial expression analysis, use of 3D cartoons, haptic feedback, engaging interface, text-to-speech, use of Applied Behaviour Analysis therapy, Augmentative and Alternative Communication techniques, among others were also deconstructed. As a result, software developers and healthcare professionals can consider the identified features in designing future support tools for autistic people. This study hypothesises that by studying these current features, further recommendations of how existing applications for ASD people could be enhanced using AI for (1) progress tracking, (2) personalised content delivery, (3) automated reasoning, (4) image recognition, and (5) Natural Language Processing (NLP). This paper follows the PRISMA methodology, which involves a set of recommendations for reporting systematic reviews and meta-analyses.", "To investigate the effect of hypercortisolism on the developing brain we performed clinical, cognitive, and psychological evaluation of children with Cushing disease (CD) at diagnosis and 1 year after remission.\nProspective study of 41 children with CD. Children completed diverse sets of cognitive measures before and 1 year after remission. Neuropsychological evaluation included the Wechsler Intelligence Scale, California Verbal Learning Test, Trail Making Test, the combined subset scores of Wide Range Achievement Test and Woodcock-Johnson Psychoeducational Battery Test of Achievement, and the Behavioral Assessment System for Children.\nComprehensive cognitive evaluations at baseline and 1 year following cure revealed significant decline mostly in nonverbal skills. Decrements occurred in most of the various indices that measure all aspects of cognitive function and younger age and early pubertal stage largely contributed to most of this decline. Results indicated that age at baseline was associated with positive regression weights for changes in scores for verbal, performance, and full intelligence quotient (IQ) scores and for subtests arithmetic, picture completion, coding, block design, scores; indicating that older age at baseline was associated with less of a deterioration in cognitive scores from pre- to posttreatment.\nOur findings suggest that chronic glucocorticoid excess and accompanying secondary hormonal imbalances followed by eucortisolemia have detrimental effects on cognitive function in the developing brain; younger age and pubertal stage are risk factors for increased vulnerability, while older adolescents have cognitive vulnerabilities like that of adult patients affected with CD.", "The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic went down in history as a pandemic caused by corona-viruses that emerged in 2019 and spread rapidly around the world. The different symptoms of COVID-19 made it difficult to understand which variables were more influential on the diagnosis, course and mortality of the disease. Machine learning models can accurately assess hidden patterns among risk factors by analyzing large-datasets to quickly predict diagnosis, prognosis and mortality of diseases. Because of this advantage, the use of machine learning models as decision support systems in health services is increasing. The aim of this study is to determine the diagnosis and prognosis of COVID-19 disease with blood-gas data using the Chi-squared Automatic Interaction Detector (CHAID) decision-tree-model, one of the machine learning methods, which is a subfield of artificial intelligence. This study was carried out on a total of 686 patients with COVID-19 (n = 343) and non-COVID-19 (n = 343) treated at Erzincan-Meng\u00fccek-Gazi-Training and Research-Hospital between April 1, 2020 and March 1, 2021. Arterial blood gas values of all patients were obtained from the hospital registry system. While the total-accuracyratio of the decision-tree-model was 65.0% in predicting the prognosis of the disease, it was 68.2% in the diagnosis of the disease. According to the results obtained, the low ionized-calcium value (< 1.10 mM) significantly predicted the need for intensive care of COVID-19 patients. At admission, low-carboxyhemoglobin (< 1.00%), high-pH (> 7.43), low-sodium (< 135.0 mM), hematocrit (< 40.0%), and methemoglobin (< 1.30%) values are important biomarkers in the diagnosis of COVID-19 and the results were promising. The findings in the study may aid in the early-diagnosis of the disease and the intensive-care treatment of patients who are severe. The study was approved by the Ministry of Health and Erzincan University Faculty of Medicine Clinical Research Ethics Committee.", "The exposure of carbon-fiber-reinforced polymers (CFRPs) to open-field conditions was investigated. Establishment of structure-property relations with nanoindentation enabled the observation of modification effects on carbon-fiber interfaces, and impact resistance. Mapping of nanomechanical properties was performed using expectation-maximization optimization of Gaussian fitting for each CFRPs microstructure (matrix, interface, carbon fiber), while Weibull analysis connected the weathering effect to the statistically representative behavior of the produced composites. Plasma modification demonstrated reduced defect density and improved nanomechanical properties after weathering. Artificial intelligence for anomaly detection provided insights on condition monitoring of CFRPs. Deep-learning neural networks with three hidden layers were used to model the resistance to plastic deformation based on nanoindentation parameters. This study provides new assessment insights in composite engineering and quality assurance, especially during exposure under service conditions.", "The article examines the problem of ensuring the political stability of a democratic social system with a shortage of a vital commodity (like vaccine against COVID-19). In such a system, members of society citizens assess the authorities. Thus, actions by the authorities to increase the supply of this commodity can contribute to citizens' approval and hence political stability. However, this supply is influenced by random factors, the actions of competitors, etc. Therefore, citizens do not have sufficient information about all the possibilities of supplying, and it is difficult for them to make the right decisions. Such citizen unawareness can be exploited by unscrupulous politicians to achieve personal targets. Therefore, it is necessary to organize public control to motivate politicians to use all available opportunities in supplying. The goal of the paper is to build such a digital mechanism of public control of the politicians by citizens, which would best assess and stimulate the activities of the authorities to improve the supply of a vital commodity. In the age of artificial intelligence, such digital public control in the face of uncertainty can be based on digital machine learning. In addition, it is necessary to take into account and model the activities of politicians associated with the presence of their own targets that do not coincide with public ones. Such politicians can use the learning of citizens for their own targets. The objective of the article is to build an optimal digital mechanism of public control in a two-level model of a democratic social system-a digital society. At its top level, there is the Citizen, who gives an assessment for the Politico located at the lower level. In turn, the Politico can influence the supplying of a vital commodity. Political stability is guaranteed if the Citizen regularly approves of the Politico's actions to increase this supply. However, the Politico may not use the opportunities available to him to offer a commodity to achieve a personal target. To avoid this, the Politico's control mechanism is proposed. It includes the procedure for digital learning of the Citizen, as well as a procedure for assessing the Politico activity. Sufficient conditions have been found for the synthesis of such the Politico's control mechanism, at which stochastic possibilities of increasing the supply of a vital commodity are used. The example of such the Politico's control mechanism is considered on the case of supply of the COVID-19 vaccine in England.", "In this article, we analyse the role that artificial intelligence (AI) could play, and is playing, to combat global climate change. We identify two crucial opportunities that AI offers in this domain: it can help improve and expand current understanding of climate change, and it can contribute to combatting the climate crisis effectively. However, the development of AI also raises two sets of problems when considering climate change: the possible exacerbation of social and ethical challenges already associated with AI, and the contribution to climate change of the greenhouse gases emitted by training data and computation-intensive AI systems. We assess the carbon footprint of AI research, and the factors that influence AI's greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in this domain. We find that the carbon footprint of AI research may be significant and highlight the need for more evidence concerning the trade-off between the GHG emissions generated by AI research and the energy and resource efficiency gains that AI can offer. In light of our analysis, we argue that leveraging the opportunities offered by AI for global climate change whilst limiting its risks is a gambit which requires responsive, evidence-based, and effective governance to become a winning strategy. We conclude by identifying the European Union as being especially well-placed to play a leading role in this policy response and provide 13 recommendations that are designed to identify and harness the opportunities of AI for combatting climate change, while reducing its impact on the environment.", "Although recent scientific studies suggest that artificial intelligence (AI) could provide value in many radiology applications, much of the hard engineering work required to consistently realize this value in practice remains to be done. In this article, we summarize the various ways in which AI can benefit radiology practice, identify key challenges that must be overcome for those benefits to be delivered, and discuss promising avenues by which these challenges can be addressed.", "Artificial intelligence technology promises to redefine the practice of radiology. However, it exists in a nascent phase and remains largely untested in the clinical space. This nature is both a cause and consequence of the uncertain legal-regulatory environment it enters. This discussion aims to shed light on these challenges, tracing the various pathways toward approval by the US Food and Drug Administration, the future of government oversight, privacy issues, ethical dilemmas, and practical considerations related to implementation in radiologist practice.", "Ovarian cancer is one of the three most common gynecological cancers in the world, and is regarded as a priority in terms of women's cancer. In the past few years, many researchers have attempted to develop and apply artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to multiple clinical scenarios of ovarian cancer, especially in the field of medical imaging. AI-assisted imaging studies have involved computer tomography (CT), ultrasonography (US), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In this review, we perform a literature search on the published studies that using AI techniques in the medical care of ovarian cancer, and bring up the advances in terms of four clinical aspects, including medical diagnosis, pathological classification, targeted biopsy guidance, and prognosis prediction. Meanwhile, current status and existing issues of the researches on AI application in ovarian cancer are discussed.", "Research investigating neuromotor function in the absence of cerebral palsy (CP) for children who had neonatal HIE is limited.\nTo investigate school-age neurological and neuromotor function, and correlations with attention, neonatal Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), and neuromotor assessments at toddler age.\nTwenty-seven children with neonatal HIE without CP who underwent hypothermia treatment and a comparison group of 20 children were assessed at age 5-7 years for Minor Neurological Dysfunction (MND; simplified Touwen), motor skills (Movement Assessment Battery for Children-2; MABC-2), parental concern over motor function (MABC Checklist), general cognition (Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence-IV, WPPSI), and attention (DuPaul ADHD Rating Scale). Neurological examination and motor development, using Bayley-3 scales, at age 24-months was extracted from the clinical database. Clinical neonatal MRI was assessed for hypoxic-ischaemic injury.\nIn the HIE group, MND was more prevalent (p\u00a0=\u00a00.026) and M-ABC performance (total score p\u00a0=\u00a00.006; balance subtest p\u00a0=\u00a00.008) was worse; parents were more concerned about children's motor function (p\u00a0=\u00a00.011). HIE group inattention scores were higher (p\u00a0=\u00a00.032), which correlated with lower MABC-2 scores (rs\u00a0=\u00a0-0.590, p\u00a0=\u00a00.004). Neurological examination at 24-months correlated with MND (rs\u00a0=\u00a00.437, p\u00a0=\u00a00.033); Bayley-3 motor scores did not correlate with M-ABC-2 scores (rs\u00a0=\u00a0368, p\u00a0=\u00a00.133). Neonatal MRI findings were not associated with school-age MND (rs\u00a0=\u00a00.140, p\u00a0=\u00a00.523) or MABC-2 (rs\u00a0=\u00a00.300, p\u00a0=\u00a00.165).\nChildren with neonatal HIE, without CP, treated with hypothermia may be more likely to develop MND and motor difficulties than typically developing peers. Inattention may contribute to motor performance. In the absence of CP, neonatal MRI and toddler age assessment of motor development have limited predictive value for school-age outcome. Since this was an exploratory study with a small sample size, findings should be confirmed by a definite larger study.", "In recent years, cardiovascular imaging has become an important tool to evaluate cardiovascular diseases, which can provide anatomical and function information in multidimensional ways, and is expected to have a positive impact on the diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular diseases.

Methods: We enrolled 33 consecutive patients with known or suspected coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent CCTA and subsequently invasive coronary angiography (ICA) within 1 month in the department of radiology, Peking Union Medical College Hospital between February 2020 and February 2021. Among them, there are 26 males and 7 females, age range from 45 to 86 (61.9\u00b19.0) years. The CCTA images were reconstructed with DLR and hybrid iterative reconstruction (HIR). Image noise, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) were calculated on the aorta root, left main artery, proximal left anterior descending, left circumflex, and right coronary artery of the CCTA images and were used to evaluate the objective image quality (IQ). Subjective IQ score was graded using Likert four-point scale (1 for excellent and 4 for poor). The diagnostic performance of obstructive coronary artery disease caused by calcified lesions on CCTA subjected to DLR and HIR methods were evaluated using ICA as the reference standard. Results: A total of 123 lesions in 33 patients were included in the analysis. Image noise of DLR image was significantly lower than that on HIR image(defined as the standard deviation of the attenuation values in the aortic root: 18.12\u00b13.66 vs 24.19\u00b15.71, P<0.001), CNR and SNR of DLR image in the aortic root were higher (CNR:43.83\u00b123.73 vs 26.38\u00b19.69, P<0.001,SNR:26.66\u00b17.83 vs 21.23\u00b18.65, P<0.001). Subjective scores of DLR was better than HIR image (1.12\u00b10.41 vs 1.46\u00b10.60,P<0.001). The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of DLR and HIR images for diagnosing obstructive coronary artery disease caused by calcified lesions were 100.0%, 77.4%, 78.9% and 100.0%, 63.5%, 65.9%%, respectively. The number of false positive cases on DLR image decreased by 38% compared with HIR. Conclusions: Artificial intelligence based DLR can significantly reduce the image noise and improve the image quality of CCTA. DLR helps to improve the diagnostic performance of CCTA in assessing obstructive coronary artery disease caused by calcified lesions, which may have good clinical application value.\n\u76ee\u7684\uff1a \u63a2\u8ba8\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u91cd\u5efa\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08DLR\uff09\u7684\u51a0\u72b6\u52a8\u8109CT\u8840\u7ba1\u6210\u50cf\uff08CCTA\uff09\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u5bf9\u9499\u5316\u75c5\u53d8\u6240\u81f4\u51a0\u72b6\u52a8\u8109\u72ed\u7a84\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u4ef7\u503c\u3002 \u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a \u524d\u77bb\u6027\u7eb3\u51652020\u5e742\u6708\u81f32021\u5e742\u6708\u5317\u4eac\u534f\u548c\u533b\u9662\u653e\u5c04\u79d1\u786e\u8bca\u6216\u62df\u8bca\u51a0\u5fc3\u75c5\u768433\u4f8b\u60a3\u8005\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u753726\u4f8b\uff0c\u59737\u4f8b\uff0c\u5e74\u9f8445~86\uff0861.9\u00b19.0\uff09\u5c81\u3002\u6240\u6709\u60a3\u8005\u63a5\u53d7CCTA\u68c0\u67e5\u5e76\u4e8e1\u4e2a\u6708\u5185\u8fdb\u884c\u6709\u521b\u51a0\u72b6\u52a8\u8109\u9020\u5f71\uff08ICA\uff09\u68c0\u67e5\u3002\u91c7\u7528DLR\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u8fed\u4ee3\u91cd\u5efa\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08HIR\uff09\u91cd\u5efaCCTA\u56fe\u50cf\u3002\u5206\u522b\u5728\u4e3b\u52a8\u8109\u6839\u90e8\u3001\u5de6\u4e3b\u5e72\u5f00\u53e3\u3001\u5de6\u524d\u964d\u652f\u8fd1\u6bb5\u3001\u5de6\u56de\u65cb\u652f\u8fd1\u6bb5\u53ca\u53f3\u51a0\u72b6\u52a8\u8109\u8fd1\u6bb5\u9009\u53d6\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u611f\u5174\u8da3\u533a\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e24\u79cd\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u3001\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\uff08SNR\uff09\u3001\u5bf9\u6bd4\u566a\u58f0\u6bd4\uff08CNR\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u4ee5Likert 4\u7ea7\u8bc4\u5206\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u4e3b\u89c2\u8bc4\u5206\uff081\u5206\uff0c\u4f18\u79c0\uff1b4\u5206\uff0c\u4e0d\u80fd\u8bca\u65ad\uff09\u3002\u4ee5ICA\u4e3a\u91d1\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u57fa\u4e8eDLR\u548cHIR\u7684CCTA\u8bca\u65ad\u9499\u5316\u6591\u5757\u6240\u81f4\u51a0\u72b6\u52a8\u8109\u8840\u6d41\u6897\u963b\u6027\u75c5\u53d8\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u6548\u80fd\u3002 \u7ed3\u679c\uff1a \u517133\u4f8b\u60a3\u8005\u7684123\u5904\u75c5\u53d8\u7eb3\u5165\u5206\u6790\u3002DLR\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u4f4e\u4e8eHIR\u56fe\u50cf\uff08\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u4e3b\u52a8\u8109\u6839\u90e8CT\u503c\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u5dee\uff1a18.12\u00b13.66\u6bd424.19\u00b15.71\uff0cP<0.001\uff09\uff0cCNR\u548cSNR\u5747\u9ad8\u4e8eHIR\u56fe\u50cf\uff08\u4e3b\u52a8\u8109\u6839\u90e8CNR\uff1a43.83\u00b123.73\u6bd426.38\u00b19.69\uff0cP<0.001\uff0cSNR\uff1a26.66\u00b17.83\u6bd421.23\u00b18.65\uff0cP<0.001\uff09\uff0c\u4e3b\u89c2\u8bc4\u5206\u4f18\u4e8eHIR\u56fe\u50cf\uff081.12\u00b10.41\u6bd41.46\u00b10.60\uff0cP<0.001\uff09\u3002DLR\u4e0eHIR\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8bca\u65ad\u9499\u5316\u75c5\u53d8\u6240\u81f4\u51a0\u72b6\u52a8\u8109\u8840\u6d41\u6897\u963b\u6027\u75c5\u53d8\u7684\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u3001\u7279\u5f02\u5ea6\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u5ea6\u5206\u522b\u4e3a100.0%\u300177.4%\u300178.9%\u548c100.0%\u300163.5%\u300165.9%\u3002\u4e0eHIR\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cDLR\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0aCCTA\u7684\u5047\u9633\u6027\u75c5\u4f8b\u51cf\u5c1138%\u3002 \u7ed3\u8bba\uff1a \u57fa\u4e8e\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7684DLR\u91cd\u5efa\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4eCCTA\u56fe\u50cf\u566a\u58f0\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u3002DLR\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63d0\u9ad8CCTA\u5bf9\u9499\u5316\u6591\u5757\u6240\u81f4\u51a0\u72b6\u52a8\u8109\u8840\u6d41\u6897\u963b\u6027\u75c5\u53d8\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u6548\u80fd\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002.", "Background and Objective: Copper, a wide spectrum biocide, also plays a key role in angiogenesis and wound healing. Antibacterial wound dressings impregnated with copper oxide microparticles (COD) have been recently cleared by the U.S. FDA and other regulatory bodies for the treatment of acute and chronic wounds, including diabetic wounds. Our objective was to evaluate the capacity of COD in stimulating the healing of non-infected stagnated wounds in diabetic patients initially treated with standard of care (SOC) dressings. Materials and Methods: The trial was divided into the three following phases: 1-2 weeks of screening, during which the patients were treated with SOC dressings; 4 weeks of treatment, during which the COD was applied twice weekly; and 2 weeks of follow-up, during which the patients were again treated with SOC dressings. The wound conditions and sizes were assessed by clinical evaluation and a wound imaging artificial intelligence system. Results: Following 1 month of COD treatment, there was a clear reduction in the mean wound area (53.2%; p = 0.003), an increase in granulation tissue (43.37; p < 0.001), and a reduction in fibrins (47.8%; p = 0.002). In patients with non-weight-bearing wounds, the reduction in wound size was even more dramatic (66.9%; p < 0.001). Conclusions: The results of this study, showing a statistically significant influence of COD on wound healing of hard-to-heal wounds in diabetic patients, strongly supports the notion that copper oxide-impregnated dressings enhance wound healing directly. Further larger controlled studies should be conducted to substantiate our findings.", "SARS-CoV-2 has significantly transformed the healthcare environment, and it has triggered the development of electronic health and artificial intelligence mechanisms, for instance. In this overview, we concentrated on enhancing the two concepts in surgery after the pandemic, and we examined the factors on a global scale.\nThe primary goal of this scoping review is to elaborate on how surgeons have used eHealth and AI before; during; and after the current global pandemic. More specifically, this review focuses on the empowerment of the concepts of electronic health and artificial intelligence after the pandemic; which mainly depend on the efforts of countries to advance the notions of surgery.\nThe use of an online search engine was the most applied method. The publication years of all the studies included in the study ranged from 2013 to 2021. Out of the reviewed studies; forty-four qualified for inclusion in the review.\nWe evaluated the prevalence of the concepts in different continents such as the United States; Europe; Asia; the Middle East; and Africa. Our research reveals that the success of eHealth and artificial intelligence adoption primarily depends on the efforts of countries to advance the notions in surgery.\nThe study's primary limitation is insufficient information on eHealth and artificial intelligence concepts; particularly in developing nations. Future research should focus on establishing methods of handling eHealth and AI challenges around confidentiality and data security.", "We applied an artificial intelligence-based model to predict fragility fractures in postmenopausal women, using different dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) parameters.\nOne hundred seventy-four postmenopausal women without vertebral fractures (VFs) at baseline (mean age 66.3 \u00b1 9.8) were retrospectively evaluated. Data has been collected from September 2010 to August 2018. All subjects performed a spine x-ray to assess VFs, together with lumbar and femoral DXA for bone mineral density (BMD) and the bone strain index (BSI) evaluation. Follow-up exams were performed after 3.34 \u00b1 1.91\u2009years. Considering the occurrence of new VFs at follow-up, two groups were created: fractured versus not-fractured. We applied an artificial neural network (ANN) analysis with a predictive tool (TWIST system) to select relevant input data from a list of 13 variables including BMD and BSI. A semantic connectivity map was built to analyse the connections among variables within the groups. For group comparisons, an independent-samples t-test was used; variables were expressed as mean \u00b1 standard deviation.\nFor each patient, we evaluated a total of n = 6 exams. At follow-up, n = 69 (39.6%) women developed a VF. ANNs reached a predictive accuracy of 79.56% within the training testing procedure, with a sensitivity of 80.93% and a specificity of 78.18%. The semantic connectivity map showed that a low BSI at the total femur is connected to the absence of VFs.\nWe found a high performance of ANN analysis in predicting the occurrence of VFs. Femoral BSI appears as a useful DXA index to identify patients at lower risk for lumbar VFs.", "The global spread of COVID-19 has raised the importance of pharmaceutical drug development as intractable and hot research. Developing new drug molecules to overcome any disease is a costly and lengthy process, but the process continues uninterrupted. The critical point to consider the drug design is to use the available data resources and to find new and novel leads. Once the drug target is identified, several interdisciplinary areas work together with artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) methods to get enriched drugs. These AI and ML methods are applied in every step of the computer-aided drug design, and integrating these AI and ML methods results in a high success rate of hit compounds. In addition, this AI and ML integration with high-dimension data and its powerful capacity have taken a step forward. Clinical trials output prediction through the AI/ML integrated models could further decrease the clinical trials cost by also improving the success rate. Through this review, we discuss the backend of AI and ML methods in supporting the computer-aided drug design, along with its challenge and opportunity for the pharmaceutical industry. From the available information or data, the AI and ML based prediction for the high throughput virtual screening. After this integration of AI and ML, the success rate of hit identification has gained a momentum with huge success by providing novel drugs.", "The ability to synchronise one's movements to the sound of a regular beat has been found to be associated with children's language and reading abilities. Sensorimotor synchronisation or tapping performance can among other factors [e.g., working memory and rapid automatized naming (RAN)] predict phonological awareness and word reading accuracy and fluency of first graders. While tapping tasks that use a simple metronome sound are more often used, applying musical stimuli has the potential advantage of being more engaging and motivating for children. In the present study, we investigated whether tapping to a metronome beat or complex musical stimuli would predict phonological awareness and reading outcomes of Hungarian 6-7-year olds (N=37). We also measured participants' general cognitive abilities (RAN, non-verbal intelligence and verbal working memory). Our results show that phonological awareness, spelling and reading accuracy were associated with the musical tasks while reading fluency was predicted by the metronome trials. Our findings suggest that complex musical tasks should be considered when investigating this age group, as they were, in general, more effective in predicting literacy outcomes.", "Games, which can be defined as an externally structured, goal-directed type of play, are increasingly being used in high-stakes testing contexts to measure targeted constructs for use in the selection and promotion of employees. Despite this increasing popularity, little is known about how theory-driven game-based assessments (GBA), those designed to reflect a targeted construct, should be designed, or their potential for achieving their simultaneous goals of positive reactions and high-quality psychometric measurement. In the present research, we develop a theory of GBA design by integrating game design and development theory from human-computer interaction with psychometric theory. Next, we test measurement characteristics, prediction of performance, fairness, and reactions of a GBA designed according to this theory to measure latent general intelligence (g). Using an academic sample with GPA data (N = 633), we demonstrate convergence between latent GBA performance and g (\u03b2 = .97). Adding an organizational sample with supervisory ratings of job performance (N = 49), we show GBA prediction of both GPA (r = .16) and supervisory ratings (r = .29). We also show incremental prediction of GPA using unit-weighted composites of the g test battery beyond that of the g-GBA battery but not the reverse. We also show the presence of similar adverse impact for both the traditional test battery and GBA but the absence of differential prediction of criteria. Reactions were more positive across all measures for the g-GBA compared to the traditional test battery. Overall, results support GBA design theory as a promising foundation from which to build high-quality theory-driven GBAs.

Machine Learning and Deep Learning Approaches for Diagnosis and Treatment were identified.\nSeveral electronic datasets were analyzed. The search covered the years from January 2019 to June 2021. The inclusion criteria were studied evaluating the use of AI methods in COVID-19 disease reporting performance results in terms of accuracy or precision or area under Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC).\nTwenty-two studies met the inclusion criteria: 13 papers were based on AI in CXR and 10 based on AI in CT. The summarized mean value of the accuracy and precision of CXR in COVID-19 disease were 93.7% \u00b1 10.0% of standard deviation (range 68.4-99.9%) and 95.7% \u00b1 7.1% of standard deviation (range 83.0-100.0%), respectively. The summarized mean value of the accuracy and specificity of CT in COVID-19 disease were 89.1% \u00b1 7.3% of standard deviation (range 78.0-99.9%) and 94.5 \u00b1 6.4% of standard deviation (range 86.0-100.0%), respectively. No statistically significant difference in summarized accuracy mean value between CXR and CT was observed using the Chi square test (p value > 0.05).\nSummarized accuracy of the selected papers is high but there was an important variability; however, less in CT studies compared to CXR studies. Nonetheless, AI approaches could be used in the identification of disease clusters, monitoring of cases, prediction of the future outbreaks, mortality risk, COVID-19 diagnosis, and disease management.", "This narrative review aims to provide an overview of the main Machine Learning (ML) techniques and their applications in pharmacogenetics (such as antidepressant, anti-cancer and warfarin drugs) over the past 10 years. ML deals with the study, the design and the development of algorithms that give computers capability to learn without being explicitly programmed. ML is a sub-field of artificial intelligence, and to date, it has demonstrated satisfactory performance on a wide range of tasks in biomedicine. According to the final goal, ML can be defined as Supervised (SML) or as Unsupervised (UML). SML techniques are applied when prediction is the focus of the research. On the other hand, UML techniques are used when the outcome is not known, and the goal of the research is unveiling the underlying structure of the data. The increasing use of sophisticated ML algorithms will likely be instrumental in improving knowledge in pharmacogenetics.", "Being a parent is complicated in typical circumstances, with a great psychological impact as well as feelings and experiences of great intensity. This impact is greater in families in vulnerable situations, such as those with children with mental health problems, receiving treatment in a clinical setting. Due to these challenges, parenting in these circumstances is often accompanied by experiences of stress. An approach that has shown evidence of effectiveness in mitigating the negative impact of stress is mindfulness-based interventions, including the Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction intervention program. The Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction intervention program is designed as a psychoeducational, instructional, multimodal, and structured program whose main objective is to provide strategies for the management, coping, and awareness of stress in order to reduce it. In this paper, a protocol for the implementation and evaluation of the original Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction intervention program with the added positive parenting component is presented, in order to systematize the incorporation of a parenting component in the Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction intervention program, analyze its effectiveness for parents whose children have mental health problems (in terms of stress, mindfulness, emotional intelligence, general health, and parental role), explore the mechanisms of change operating in this intervention as perceived by the participants, and examine the application of acquired strategies to daily life.", "Livestock radiated out from domestication centres to most regions of the world, gradually adapting to diverse environments, from very hot to sub-zero temperatures and from wet and humid conditions to deserts. The climate is changing; generally global temperature is increasing, although there are also more extreme cold periods, storms, and higher solar radiation. These changes impact livestock welfare and productivity. This review describes advances in the methodology for studying livestock genomes and the impact of the environment on animal production, giving examples of discoveries made. Sequencing livestock genomes has facilitated genome-wide association studies to localize genes controlling many traits, and population genetics has identified genomic regions under selection or introgressed from one breed into another to improve production or facilitate adaptation. Landscape genomics, which combines global positioning and genomics, has identified genomic features that enable animals to adapt to local environments. Combining the advances in genomics and methods for predicting changes in climate is generating an explosion of data which calls for innovations in the way big data sets are treated. Artificial intelligence and machine learning are now being used to study the interactions between the genome and the environment to identify historic effects on the genome and to model future scenarios.", "This study aims to evaluate the practical application value of the teaching method under the guidance of educational psychology and artificial intelligence (AI) design, taking the deep learning theory as the basis of teaching design. The research objects of this study involve all the teachers, students, and students' parents of Ningbo Middle School. The questionnaires are developed to survey the changes in the performance of students before and after the implementation of the teaching design and the satisfaction of all teachers, students, and parents to different teaching methods by comparing the two results and the satisfaction ratings. All objects in this study volunteer to participate in the questionnaire survey. The results suggest the following: (1) the effective return rates of the questionnaires to teachers, students, and parents are 97, 99, and 95%, respectively, before implementation; whereas those after implementation are 98, 99, and 99%, respectively. Comparison of the two return results suggests that there was no significant difference statistically (P > 0.05). (2) Proportion of scoring results before and after implementation is given as follows: the proportions of levels A, B, C, and D are 35, 40, 15, and 10% before implementation, respectively; while those after implementation are 47, 36, 12, and 5%, respectively. After the implementation, the proportion of level A is obviously higher than that before the implementation, and the proportions of other levels decreased in contrast to those before the implementation, showing statistically obvious differences (P < 0.05). (3) The change in the performance of each subject after 1 year implementation is significantly higher than that before the implementation, and the change in the average performance of each subject shows an upward trend. In summary, (1) the comparison on the effective return rate of the satisfaction survey questionnaire proves the feasibility of its scoring results. (2) The comparison of the survey scoring results shows that people are more satisfied with the new educational design teaching method. (3) The comparison of the change in the performance of each subject before and after the implementation indirectly reflects the drawbacks of partial subject education, indicating that the school should pay the same equal attention to every subject. (4) Due to various objective and subjective factors, the results of this study may be different from the actual situation slightly, and its accuracy has to be further explored in the future.", "We explored the feasibility of automated, arterial input function independent, vendor neutral prediction of core infarct, and penumbral tissue using complete and partial computed tomographic perfusion data sets through neural networks.\nUsing retrospective computed tomographic perfusion data from 57 patients, split as training/validation (60%/40%), we developed and validated separate 2-dimensional U-net models for cerebral blood flow (CBF) and time to maximum (Tmax) maps calculation to predict core infarct and tissue at risk, respectively. Once trained, the full sets of 28 input images were sequentially reduced to equitemporal 14, 10, and 7 time points. The averaged structural similarity index measure between the model-derived images and ground truth perfusion maps was compared. Volumes for core infarct and Tmax were compared using the Pearson correlation coefficient.\nBoth CBF and Tmax maps derived using 28 and 14 time points had similar structural similarity index measure (0.80-0.81; P>0.05) when compared with ground truth images. The Pearson correlation for the CBF and Tmax volumes derived from the model using 28-tp with ground truth volumes derived from the RAPID software was 0.69 for CBF and 0.74 for Tmax. The predicted maps were fully concordant in terms of laterality to the commercial perfusion maps. The mean Dice scores were 0.54 for the core infarct and 0.63 for the hypoperfusion maps.\nArtificial intelligence model-derived volumes show good correlation with RAPID-derived volumes for CBF and Tmax. Within the constraints of a small sample size, the perfusion map quality is similar when using 14-tp instead of 28-tp. Our findings provide proof of concept that vendor neutral artificial intelligence models for computed tomographic perfusion processing using complete or partial image data sets appear feasible. The model accuracy could be further optimized using larger data sets.", "Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), subdivided into Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), are chronic diseases that are characterized by relapsing and remitting periods of inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract. In recent years, the amount of research surrounding digital health (DH) and artificial intelligence (AI) has increased. The purpose of this scoping review is to explore this growing field of research to summarize the role of DH and AI in the diagnosis, treatment, monitoring and prognosis of IBD. A review of 21 articles revealed the impact of both AI algorithms and DH technologies; AI algorithms can improve diagnostic accuracy, assess disease activity, and predict treatment response based on data modalities such as endoscopic imaging and genetic data. In terms of DH, patients utilizing DH platforms experienced improvements in quality of life, disease literacy, treatment adherence, and medication management. In addition, DH methods can reduce the need for in-person appointments, decreasing the use of healthcare resources without compromising the standard of care. These articles demonstrate preliminary evidence of the potential of DH and AI for improving the management of IBD. However, the majority of these studies were performed in a regulated clinical environment. Therefore, further validation of these results in a real-world environment is required to assess the efficacy of these methods in the general IBD population.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) has been developed through repeated new discoveries since around 1960. The use of AI is now becoming widespread within society and our daily lives. AI is also being introduced into healthcare, such as medicine and drug development; however, it is currently biased towards specific domains. The present review traces the history of the development of various AI-based applications in healthcare and compares AI-based healthcare with conventional healthcare to show the future prospects for this type of care. Knowledge of the past and present development of AI-based applications would be useful for the future utilization of novel AI approaches in healthcare.", "Colorectal cancer is a high death rate cancer until now; from the clinical view, the diagnosis of the tumour region is critical for the doctors. But with data accumulation, this task takes lots of time and labor with large variances between different doctors. With the development of computer vision, detection and segmentation of the colorectal cancer region from CT or MRI image series are a great challenge in the past decades, and there still have great demands on automatic diagnosis. In this paper, we proposed a novel transfer learning protocol, called CST, that is, a union framework for colorectal cancer region detection and segmentation task based on the transformer model, which effectively constructs the cancer region detection and its segmentation jointly. To make a higher detection accuracy, we incorporate an autoencoder-based image-level decision approach that leverages the image-level decision of a cancer slice. We also compared our framework with one-stage and two-stage object detection methods; the results show that our proposed method achieves better results on detection and segmentation tasks. And this proposed framework will give another pathway for colorectal cancer screen by way of artificial intelligence.", "Medical records scoring is important in a health care system. Artificial intelligence (AI) with projection word embeddings has been validated in its performance disease coding tasks, which maintain the vocabulary diversity of open internet databases and the medical terminology understanding of electronic health records (EHRs). We considered that an AI-enhanced system might be also applied to automatically score medical records. This study aimed to develop a series of deep learning models (DLMs) and validated their performance in medical records scoring task. We also analyzed the practical value of the best model. We used the admission medical records from the Tri-Services General Hospital during January 2016 to May 2020, which were scored by our visiting staffs with different levels from different departments. The medical records were scored ranged 0 to 10. All samples were divided into a training set (n = 74,959) and testing set (n = 152,730) based on time, which were used to train and validate the DLMs, respectively. The mean absolute error (MAE) was used to evaluate each DLM performance. In original AI medical record scoring, the predicted score by BERT architecture is closer to the actual reviewer score than the projection word embedding and LSTM architecture. The original MAE is 0.84 \u00b1 0.27 using the BERT model, and the MAE is 1.00 \u00b1 0.32 using the LSTM model. Linear mixed model can be used to improve the model performance, and the adjusted predicted score was closer compared to the original score. However, the project word embedding with the LSTM model (0.66 \u00b1 0.39) provided better performance compared to BERT (0.70 \u00b1 0.33) after linear mixed model enhancement (p < 0.001). In addition to comparing different architectures to score the medical records, this study further uses a mixed linear model to successfully adjust the AI medical record score to make it closer to the actual physician's score.", "Low well-being is common among people with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). We propose a model to examine how different types of resources work together to maintain well-being in people with MCI.\nParticipants included 121 community dwelling adults over the age of 60 who were diagnosed with MCI. Structural equation modeling assessed suggested relationships between resources and well-being.\nEmotional intelligence, general mental ability, morbidity, economic status, basic activities of daily living, and age were correlated to well-being in a triple mediation process through cognitive function, instrumental activities of daily living, and social support. Model fit was excellent (RMSEA-0.04; IFI-.96; CFI-.96; CMIN/DF-1.23), CONCLUSION: Achieving well-being when coping with MCI requires a combination of objective resources and subjective evaluation of the situation. Ultimately, social support determines an individual's level of well-being. Findings suggest the need to understand what kind of social support is required by those coping with MCI.", "Proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) is a major cause of blindness in diabetic individuals. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) and OCT-angiography (OCTA) are noninvasive imaging techniques useful for the diagnosis and assessment of PDR. We aim to review several recent developments using OCT and discuss their present and potential future applications in the clinical setting. An electronic database search was performed so as to include all studies assessing OCT and/or OCTA findings in PDR patients published from 1 January 2020 to 31 May 2021. Thirty studies were included, and the most recently published data essentially focused on the higher detection rate of neovascularization obtained with widefield-OCT and/or OCTA (WF-OCT/OCTA) and on the increasing quality of retinal imaging with quality levels non-inferior to widefield-fluorescein angiography (WF-FA). There were also significant developments in the study of retinal nonperfusion areas (NPAs) using these techniques and research on the impact of PDR treatment on NPAs and on vascular density. It is becoming increasingly clear that it is critical to use adequate imaging protocols focused on optimized segmentation and maximized imaged retinal area, with ongoing technological development through artificial intelligence and deep learning. These latest findings emphasize the growing applicability and role of noninvasive imaging in managing PDR with the added benefit of avoiding the repetition of invasive conventional FA.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) has developed quickly in recent years, with applications expanding from automatic driving and smart manufacturing to personal healthcare and algorithm-based social media utilization. During the COVID-19 pandemic, AI has played an essential role in identifying suspected infections, ensuring epidemic surveillance and quickening drug screening. However, many questions accompanied AI's development. How to protect citizens' privacy and national information security? What measures can help AI learn and practice good human behaviors and avoid unethical use of AI technologies? To answer these questions, Nation Science Review (NSR) interviewed Yi Zeng, Professor and Deputy Director at the Research Center for Brain-inspired Artificial Intelligence at the Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). He is a board member for the National Governance Committee of Next-Generation Artificial Intelligence affiliated to the Ministry of Science and Technology of China (MOST). Zeng is also in AI ethics expert groups at the World Health Organization and the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). He jointly led the drafting of Beijing AI Principles (2019) and the National Governance Principles of New Generation AI of China (GPNGAI, 2019).", "The development and use of digital health technology have increased during the global COVID-19 pandemic. Artificial intelligence (AI)-powered digital tools have been increasingly used to diagnose and screen for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Digital technology, in the form of mobile phone applications (apps), has been adopted by several countries to track infected individuals as infection prevention and surveillance measures. Global best practice guidelines, technology approvals, and patient care models have only recently begun to catch up with the developments in digital technology. In 2021, the WHO published a global strategy on digital health (eHealth) and mobile health (mHealth) for 2020 to 2025. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) now evaluates software as a medical device (SaMD) and software that is in a medical device (SiMD) through the International Medical Device Regulators Forum (IMDRF). This Editorial aims to discuss how the COVID-19 pandemic has driven global initiatives to support the use and regulation of digital health technology and the requirements for digital health evidence frameworks and new approaches to regulatory approvals.", "The aim of this study was to analyse the relationship between the type of delivery (vaginal or caesarean), as a risk factor, and the likelihood of having learning disabilities in reading (reading accuracy) and writing (phonetic and visual orthography), controlling for the interaction and/or confounding effect of gestational, obstetric, and neonatal variables (maternal age at delivery, gestational age, foetal presentation, Apgar 1, and newborn weight) among six-year-old children born in twin births. In this retrospective cohort study, the exposed and non-exposed cohorts consisted of children born by caesarean section and vaginal delivery, respectively. A total of 124 children born in twin births were evaluated in year one of primary education. Intelligence was measured using the K-BIT test; reading and writing variables were evaluated using the Eval\u00faa-1 battery of tests, and clinical records were used to measure gestational, obstetric, and neonatal variables. Binary logistic regressions applied to each dependent variable indicated that caesarean delivery is a possible independent risk factor for difficulties in reading accuracy and phonetic and visual orthography. Future research using larger samples of younger children is required to analyse the relationship between obstetric and neonatal variables and the different basic indicators of reading and writing.", "Studies on the theory of mind (TOM) and alexithymia in borderline personality disorder (BPD) have yielded inconsistent results. Also, the relationship between TOM abilities and alexithymia facets as two domains of social cognition has not been studied in BPD. This study aimed to fill this gap. Participants were 50 outpatients with BPD and 50 age and gender-matched healthy controls. Assessments performed using Reading the Mind in Eyes Task (RMET), Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20), Faux Pas Task (FPT), and Digit Span subtest of Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale. Results showed that BPD patients scored lower on overall FPT (p\u00a0<\u00a0.001) and its cognitive (p\u00a0<\u00a0.001) and affective TOM (p\u00a0<\u00a0.001) subtests but were comparable with healthy controls in emotion recognition ability assessed by RMET (p\u00a0=\u00a0.241). The BPD group also scored significantly lower in overall alexithymia (p\u00a0<\u00a0.001) and subscales of difficulty identifying feelings (DIF; p\u00a0<\u00a0.001) and difficulty describing emotions (DDF; p\u00a0=\u00a0.001). However, they performed similarly to the healthy control group in externally oriented thinking (EOT; p\u00a0=\u00a0.164). Correlation analysis revealed a significant negative correlation between EOT and RMET in the BPD group (r\u00a0=\u00a0-0.33, p\u00a0<\u00a0.05). No association, however, was found between FPT and RMET. This study suggests that BPD patients are impaired in the complex TOM abilities and have lower self-awareness of emotions, but their recognition of others' emotions is intact. Also, the results demonstrate that a heightened level of EOT is associated with difficulties in facial emotion recognition in BPD patients.", "Population attributable fraction (PAF), probability of causation, burden of disease, and related quantities derived from relative risk ratios are widely used in applied epidemiology and health risk analysis to quantify the extent to which reducing or eliminating exposures would reduce disease risks. This causal interpretation conflates association with causation. It has sometimes led to demonstrably mistaken predictions and ineffective risk management recommendations. Causal artificial intelligence (CAI) methods developed at the intersection of many scientific disciplines over the past century instead use quantitative high-level descriptions of networks of causal mechanisms (typically represented by conditional probability tables or structural equations) to predict the effects caused by interventions. We summarize these developments and discuss how CAI methods can be applied to realistically imperfect data and knowledge - e.g., with unobserved (latent) variables, missing data, measurement errors, interindividual heterogeneity in exposure-response functions, and model uncertainty. We recommend that CAI methods can help to improve the conceptual foundations and practical value of epidemiological calculations by replacing association-based attributions of risk to exposures or other risk factors with causal predictions of the changes in health effects caused by interventions.", "This study determined the predictive value of linguistic competence in children in Early Childhood Education for verbal naming speed.\nThe participants were 86 pupils in the second Early Childhood Education cycle. They were evaluated with WPPSI-IV Wechsler Preschool & Primary Scale of Intelligence (Verbal Comprehension, VC) and Vocabulary Acquisition, VA; Childish Vocabulary Test (Vavel) and the Rapid and Automatic Naming Test.\nChildren who had high scores in the Verbal Comprehension Index and Vocabulary Acquisition spent less time doing the verbal naming task. Linguistic competence predicted verbal naming speed, with Vavel having the strongest correlation.\nLinguistic competence of children in Early Childhood Education allows us to predict their aptitude for verbal naming. Lexical-semantic knowledge was linguistic competence dimension with the highest predictive value for the Verbal Naming Task. Automatic Naming and Verbal Comprehension depend on the same cerebral area, Wernicke's area.", "Holistic reflection encompasses reflection as a continuum, incorporating critical reflection, reflexivity, critical thinking and a whole-of-person approach. The development of holistic reflection in midwifery students and midwives is rarely measured in a standardised way.\nTo develop and test a tool to measure holistic reflection in midwifery students and midwives, for use in pre-registration and post-graduate education, and research.\nThe eight-step approach to tool development by DeVellis was followed with psychometric testing of data from a cross-sectional survey.\nMidwifery students (pre-registration and postgraduate), and midwifery alumni of an Australian university.\nDraft items (n\u2009=\u200984) were generated from review of the literature, qualitative research, and a theoretical model. An expert panel (n\u2009=\u200919) reviewed draft items resulting in 39 items. The survey included demographic details, the draft Holistic Reflection Assessment Tool, emotional intelligence subscale, and a social desirability scale. Participants repeated the online survey at two weeks to confirm test-retest reliability.\nThe 187 responses were received. Exploratory factor analysis with varimax rotation revealed three factors accounting for 49% of variance. Internal consistency of the tool was high (\u03b1\u2009=\u2009.91) and test-retest reliability at two weeks (\u03b1\u2009=\u2009.93) demonstrated stability. There were low correlations between social desirability (r\u2009=\u2009.22, p\u2009<\u2009.001) and emotional intelligence (r\u2009=\u2009.21, p\u2009<\u2009.001) with the new holistic reflection scale.\nThe Holistic Reflection Assessment Tool is the first for midwifery. The tool was reliable, stable, and valid. Further research is warranted for criterion validity.", "In the area of illicit drugs, forensic case data have proven effective at detecting links between seizures and providing greater insights into illicit drug markets. This research explored the application of mathematical and statistical techniques to several chemical profiles of Australian methylamphetamine seizures. The main aim was to create and deliver a method that would expand the use of illicit drug profiling for strategic intelligence purposes, contributing to the fight against illicit drug trafficking. The use of comparison metrics and clustering analysis to determine links between existing illicit drug specimens and subsequent new specimens was evaluated and automated. Relational, temporal and spatial analyses were subsequently used to gain an insight into illicit drug markets. Relational analysis identified clusters of seizures central to the network. Temporal analysis then provided insights into the behaviour of distribution markets, specifically the emergence and extinction of certain clusters of seizures over time. Spatial analysis aided the understanding of the inter-jurisdictional nature of illicit drug markets. These analyses allowed for the generation of strategic intelligence relating to when and where the Australian methylamphetamine illicit drug market was the most active. Additionally, the strategic level trends identified clusters of seizures that were worth investigating further. These clusters were explored through a case study, which exploited additional chemical profiling data to provide drug market knowledge at an operational level. In turn, the intelligence produced at various levels could allow relevant law enforcement agencies to take necessary measures in disrupting markets.", "Social cognitive processes, such as emotion perception and empathy, allow humans to navigate complex social landscapes and are associated with specific neural systems. In particular, theory of mind (ToM), which refers to our ability to decipher the mental states of others, is related to the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex and temporoparietal junction, which include portions of the default network. Both social cognition and the default network have been linked to the personality trait Agreeableness. We hypothesized that default network activity during a ToM task would positively predict social cognitive abilities and Agreeableness. In a 3T fMRI scanner, participants (N = 1050) completed a ToM task in which they observed triangles displaying random or social (i.e., human-like) movement. Participants also completed self-report measures of Agreeableness and tests of intelligence and social cognitive ability. In each participant, average blood oxygen level dependent responses were calculated for default network regions associated with social cognition, and structural equation modeling was used to test associations of personality and task performance with activation in those brain regions. Default network activation in the dorsal medial subsystem was greater for social versus random animations. Default network activation in response to social animations predicted better performance on social cognition tasks and, to a lesser degree, higher Agreeableness. Neural response to social stimuli in the default network may be associated with effective social processing and could have downstream effects on social interactions. We discuss theoretical and methodological implications of this work for social and personality neuroscience.", "Autonomously spiking dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) are exquisitely specialized and suffer toxic iron-loading in Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the molecular mechanism involved remains unclear and critical to decipher for designing new PD therapeutics. The long-lasting (L-type) CaV1.3 voltage-gated calcium channel is expressed at high levels amongst nigral neurons of the SNpc, and due to its role in calcium and iron influx, could play a role in the pathogenesis of PD. Neuronal iron uptake via this route could be unregulated under the pathological setting of PD and potentiate cellular stress due to its redox activity. This Commentary will focus on the role of the CaV1.3 channels in calcium and iron uptake in the context of pharmacological targeting. Prospectively, the audacious use of artificial intelligence to design innovative CaV1.3 channel inhibitors could lead to breakthrough pharmaceuticals that attenuate calcium and iron entry to ameliorate PD pathology.", "Ophthalmology has been one of the early adopters of artificial intelligence (AI) within the medical field. Deep learning (DL), in particular, has garnered significant attention due to the availability of large amounts of data and digitized ocular images. Currently, AI in Ophthalmology is mainly focused on improving disease classification and supporting decision-making when treating ophthalmic diseases such as diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration (AMD), glaucoma and retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). However, most of the DL systems (DLSs) developed thus far remain in the research stage and only a handful are able to achieve clinical translation. This phenomenon is due to a combination of factors including concerns over security and privacy, poor generalizability, trust and explainability issues, unfavorable end-user perceptions and uncertain economic value. Overcoming this challenge would require a combination approach. Firstly, emerging techniques such as federated learning (FL), generative adversarial networks (GANs), autonomous AI and blockchain will be playing an increasingly critical role to enhance privacy, collaboration and DLS performance. Next, compliance to reporting and regulatory guidelines, such as CONSORT-AI and STARD-AI, will be required to in order to improve transparency, minimize abuse and ensure reproducibility. Thirdly, frameworks will be required to obtain patient consent, perform ethical assessment and evaluate end-user perception. Lastly, proper health economic assessment (HEA) must be performed to provide financial visibility during the early phases of DLS development. This is necessary to manage resources prudently and guide the development of DLS.", "This study aimed to investigate whether a deep learning model for automated detection of unruptured intracranial aneurysms on time-of-flight (TOF) magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) can achieve a target diagnostic performance comparable to that of human radiologists for approval from the Korean Ministry of Food and Drug Safety as an artificial intelligence-applied software.\nIn this single-center, retrospective, confirmatory clinical trial, the diagnostic performance of the model was evaluated in a predetermined test set. After sample size estimation, the test set consisted of 135 aneurysm-containing examinations with 168 intracranial aneurysms and 197 aneurysm-free examinations. The target sensitivity and specificity were set as 87% and 92%, respectively. The patient-wise sensitivity and specificity of the model were analyzed. Moreover, the lesion-wise sensitivity and false-positive detection rate per case were also investigated.\nThe sensitivity and specificity of the model were 91.11% [95% confidence interval (CI): 84.99, 95.32] and 93.91% (95% CI: 89.60, 96.81), respectively, which met the target performance values. The lesion-wise sensitivity was 92.26%. The overall false-positive detection rate per case was 0.123. Of the 168 aneurysms, 13 aneurysms from 12 examinations were missed by the model.\nThe present deep learning model for automated detection of unruptured intracranial aneurysms on TOF MRA achieved the target diagnostic performance comparable to that of human radiologists. With high standalone performance, this model may be useful for accurate and efficient diagnosis of intracranial aneurysm.", "Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML) algorithms may speed up the design of DADNP systems formed by Antibacterial Drugs (AD) and Nanoparticles (NP). In this work, we used IFPTML = Information Fusion (IF) + Perturbation-Theory (PT) + Machine Learning (ML) algorithm for the first time to study of a large dataset of putative DADNP systems composed by >165\u2009000 ChEMBL AD assays and 300 NP assays vs. multiple bacteria species. We trained alternative models with Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Bayesian Networks (BNN), K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) and other algorithms. IFPTML-LDA model was simpler with values of Sp \u2248 90% and Sn \u2248 74% in both training (>124 K cases) and validation (>41 K cases) series. IFPTML-ANN and KNN models are notably more complicated even when they are more balanced Sn \u2248 Sp \u2248 88.5%-99.0% and AUROC \u2248 0.94-0.99 in both series. We also carried out a simulation (>1900 calculations) of the expected behavior for putative DADNPs in 72 different biological assays. The putative DADNPs studied are formed by 27 different drugs with multiple classes of NP and types of coats. In addition, we tested the validity of our additive model with 80 DADNP complexes experimentally synthetized and biologically tested (reported in >45 papers). All these DADNPs show values of MIC < 50 \u03bcg mL-1 (cutoff used) better that MIC of AD and NP alone (synergistic or additive effect). The assays involve DADNP complexes with 10 types of NP, 6 coating materials, NP size range 5-100 nm vs. 15 different antibiotics, and 12 bacteria species. The IFPTML-LDA model classified correctly 100% (80 out of 80) DADNP complexes as biologically active. IFPMTL additive strategy may become a useful tool to assist the design of DADNP systems for antibacterial therapy taking into consideration only information about AD and NP components by separate.", "This research focuses on the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) methodologies to the problem of classifying vehicles involved in lethal pedestrian collisions. Specifically, the vehicle type is predicted on the basis of traumatic injury suffered by casualties, exploiting machine learning algorithms. In the present study, AI-assisted diagnosis was shown to have correct prediction about 70% of the time. In pedestrians struck by trucks, more severe injuries were appreciated in the facial skeleton, lungs, major airways, liver, and spleen as well as in the sternum/clavicle/rib complex, whereas the lower extremities were more affected by fractures in pedestrians struck by cars. Although the distinction of the striking vehicle should develop beyond autopsy evidence alone, the presented approach which is novel in the realm of forensic science, is shown to be effective in building automated decision support systems. Outcomes from this system can provide valuable information after the execution of autoptic examinations supporting the forensic investigation. Preliminary results from the application of machine learning algorithms with real-world datasets seem to highlight the efficacy of the proposed approach, which could be used for further studies concerning this topic.", "Infections of orchids by the Odontoglossum ringspot virus or Cymbidium mosaic virus cause orchid disfiguration and are a substantial source of economic loss for orchid farms. Although immunoassays can identify these infections, immunoassays are expensive, time consuming, and labor consuming and limited to sampling-based testing methods. This study proposes a noncontact inspection platform that uses a spectrometer and Android smartphone. When orchid leaves are illuminated with a handheld optical probe, the Android app based on the Internet of Things and artificial intelligence can display the measured florescence spectrum and determine the infection status within 3 s by using an algorithm hosted on a remote server. The algorithm was trained on optical data and the results of polymerase chain reaction assays. The testing accuracy of the algorithm was 89%. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 91%; thus, the platform with the algorithm was accurate and convenient for infection screening in orchids.", "The aim of this study was to determine the relation between the acceptable noise level (ANL) and cognitive measures of auditory attention and working memory.\nYoung adults were administered the following tests: the ANL, the Digit Span and Letter-Number Sequencing subtests of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Fourth Edition, the Auditory Attention subtest from the Woodcock-Johnson Tests of Cognitive Abilities, the Hearing in Noise Test (HINT), and the operation span (OSPAN) test. A correlation matrix was constructed using Pearson coefficients.\nTwenty-four young adults aged 20-29 years with normal hearing participated in the study.\nNo significant relationships were found among the ANL and the different cognitive tasks, nor was there a significant relation found between the ANL and the HINT. However, significant relationships were found between individual cognitive tasks. There was a significant relation found between selective attention and the most comfortable level of presentation of a story.\nSelective attention may be a key cognitive function in acceptance of background noise.", "The unique electron spin, transfer, polarization and magnetoelectric coupling characteristics of ABO3 multiferroic perovskite materials make them promising candidates for application in multifunctional nanoelectronic devices. Reversible ferroelectric polarization, controllable defect concentration and domain wall movement originated from the ABO3 multiferroic perovskite materials promotes its memristive effect, which further highlights data storage, information processing and neuromorphic computing in diverse artificial intelligence applications. In particular, ion doping, electrode selection, and interface modulation have been demonstrated in ABO3-based memristive devices for ultrahigh data storage, ultrafast information processing, and efficient neuromorphic computing. These approaches presented today including controlling the dopant in the active layer, altering the oxygen vacancy distribution, modulating the diffusion depth of ions, and constructing the interface-dependent band structure were believed to be efficient methods for obtaining unique resistive switching (RS) behavior for various applications. In this review, internal physical dynamics, preparation technologies, and modulation methods are systemically examined as well as the progress, challenges, and possible solutions are proposed for next generation emerging ABO3-based memristive application in artificial intelligence.", "The COVID-19 pandemic has increased the demand for youth mental health services in Canada as disruptions to clinical care continue to persist due to the risk of transmission and exposure to the virus. Digital mental health interventions, including web-based resources and mobile apps, have provided opportunities to support youth mental health remotely across Canada. There is a need to better understand how these digital interventions are being selected, recommended, and used in various regions across Canada.\nA national jurisdictional scan was completed to (1) determine what web-based programs, apps, and websites are promoted and licensed in Canada for youth mental health; (2) identify criteria and decision-making processes that Canadian jurisdictions use to select web-based programs, apps, and websites for youth mental health; and (3) identify upcoming trends, innovations, and digital mental health possibilities that are emerging in the youth sector.\nThe aims of the jurisdictional scan were addressed through a review of related academic and grey literature; stakeholder interviews, including individuals involved in various areas of the youth mental health sector; and a social media review of pertinent Twitter content.\nA total of 66 web-based resources and apps were identified for use by youth in Canada. 16 stakeholder interviews were completed and included discussions with researchers, clinicians, youth organizations, and others involved in digital interventions for youth mental health. These discussions identified a limited use of frameworks used to guide decision-making processes when selecting digital interventions. Many clinicians agreed on a similar set of eligibility requirements for youth mental health apps and digital resources, such as the evidence base and cultural relevance of the intervention. Stakeholders also identified upcoming trends and innovations in the youth digital mental health space, including artificial intelligence, digital phenotyping, and personalized therapy. Over 4 weeks, 2184 tweets were reviewed to identify and compare global and national trends and innovations involving digital mental health and youth. Key trends included the promotion of regional chat services as well as the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on youth mental health and access to care.\nAs organizations begin to plan for the delivery of mental health care following the pandemic, there are concerns about the sustainability of these digital mental health interventions as well as a need for services to be more informed by the experiences and preferences of youth.", "Social intelligence requires the study of both groups of brains and the individual brain.", "To investigate the early effectiveness of artificial intelligence (AI) assisted total hip arthroplasty (THA) system (AIHIP) in the treatment of patients with Crowe type \u2163 developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH).\nThe clinical data of 23 patients with Crowe type \u2163 DDH who met the selection criteria between May 2019 and December 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. There were 3 males and 20 females, the age ranged from 44 to 74 years, with an average of 52.65 years. The absolute value of the lower limbs discrepancy before operation was (15.17\u00b122.17) mm. The preoperative Harris score was 62.4\u00b17.2. The AIHIP system was used for preoperative planning, and the operations were all performed via conventional posterolateral approach. Thirteen patients with difficulty in reduction during operation underwent subtrochanteric shortening osteotomy (SSOT). The operation time, hospital stay, and adverse events were recorded; Harris score was used to evaluate the function of the affected limb at 1 day before operation and 1 week and 6 months after operation; pelvic anteroposterior X-ray film was taken at 1 day after operation to evaluate the position of the prosthesis. The matching degree of prosthesis was evaluated according to the consistency of intraoperative prosthesis model and preoperative planning.\nThe matching degree of acetabular cup model after operation was 16 cases of perfect matching, 4 cases of general matching (1 case of +1, 3 cases of -1), and 3 cases of mismatch (all of them were +2), the coincidence rate was 86.96%. The matching degree of femoral stem model was perfect matching in 22 cases and general matching in 1 case of -1, and the coincidence rate was 100%. One patient had a periprosthesis fracture during operation, and was fixed with a wire cable during operation, and walked with the assistance of walking aid at 6 weeks after operation; the rest of the patients walked with the assistance of walking aid at 1 day after operation. The operation time was 185-315 minutes, with an average of 239.43 minutes; the hospital stay was 8-20 days, with an average of 9.96 days; and the time of disengagement from the walking aid was 2-56 days, with an average of 5.09 days. All patients were followed up 6 months. All incisions healed by first intension, and there was no complication such as infection, dislocation, refracture, and lower extremity deep venous thrombosis; X-ray films at 1 day and 6 months after operation showed that the acetabular and femoral prostheses were firmly fixed and within the safe zone; the absolute value of lower limbs discrepancy at 1 day after operation was (11.96\u00b113.48) mm, which was not significantly decreased compared with that before operation ( t=0.582, P=0.564). All osteotomies healed at 6 months after operation. The Harris scores at 1 week and 6 months after operation were 69.5\u00b14.9 and 79.2\u00b15.7 respectively, showing significant differences between pre- and post-operation ( P<0.05). At 6 months after operation, the hip function was evaluated according to Harris score, and 13 cases were good, 9 cases were fair, and 1 case was poor.\nAIHIP system-assisted THA (difficult to reposition patients combined with SSOT) for adult Crowe type \u2163 DDH has high preoperative planning accuracy, easy intraoperative reduction, early postoperative landing, and satisfactory short-term

"Exponential technologic advancements in imaging, high-performance computing, and artificial intelligence, in addition to increasing access to vast amounts of diverse data, have revolutionized the role of imaging in medicine. Radiomics is defined as a high-throughput feature-extraction method that unlocks microscale quantitative data hidden within standard-of-care medical imaging. Radiogenomics is defined as the linkage between imaging and genomics information. Multiple radiomics and radiogenomics studies performed on conventional and advanced neuro-oncology image modalities show that they have the potential to differentiate pseudoprogression from true progression, classify tumor subgroups, and predict recurrence, survival, and mutation status with high accuracy. In this article, we outline the technical steps involved in radiomics and radiogenomics analyses with the use of artificial intelligence methods and review current applications in adult and pediatric neuro-oncology.", "This article is a comprehensive review of the basic background, technique, and clinical applications of artificial intelligence (AI) and radiomics in the field of neuro-oncology. A variety of AI and radiomics utilized conventional and advanced techniques to differentiate brain tumors from non-neoplastic lesions such as inflammatory and demyelinating brain lesions. It is used in the diagnosis of gliomas and discrimination of gliomas from lymphomas and metastasis. Also, semiautomated and automated tumor segmentation has been developed for radiotherapy planning and follow-up. It has a role in the grading, prediction of treatment response, and prognosis of gliomas. Radiogenomics allowed the connection of the imaging phenotype of the tumor to its molecular environment. In addition, AI is applied for the assessment of extra-axial brain tumors and pediatric tumors with high performance in tumor detection, classification, and stratification of patient's prognoses.", "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) caused by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has led to a tremendous human fatality and economic loss. SARS-CoV-2 infectivity is a key reason for the widespread viral transmission, but its rigorous experimental measurement is essentially impossible due to the ongoing genome evolution around the world. We show that artificial intelligence (AI) and algebraic topology (AT) offer an accurate and efficient alternative to the experimental determination of viral infectivity. AI and AT analysis indicates that the on-going mutations make SARS-CoV-2 more infectious.", "AlphaScreen is one of the most widely used assay technologies in drug discovery due to its versatility, dynamic range and sensitivity. However, a presence of false positives and frequent hitters contributes to difficulties with an interpretation of measured HTS data. Although filters do exist to identify frequent hitters for AlphaScreen, they are frequently based on privileged scaffolds. The development of such filters is time consuming and requires deep domain knowledge. Recently, machine learning and artificial intelligence methods are emerging as important tools to advance drug discovery and chemoinformatics, including their application to identification of frequent hitters in screening assays. However, the relative performance and complementarity of the Machine Learning and scaffold-based techniques has not yet been comprehensively compared. In this study, we analysed filters based on the privileged scaffolds with filters built using machine learning. Our results demonstrate that machine-learning methods provide more accurate filters for identification of frequent hitters in AlphaScreen assays than scaffold-based methods and can be easily redeveloped once new data are measured. We present highly accurate models to identify frequent hitters in AlphaScreen assays.", "The aim of this study was to identify the relationship between perceived competence in spiritual care and spiritual intelligence among nursing students.\nOne of the most important duties of nurses is to pay attention to the spiritual needs of patients and provide them with proper spiritual care. Therefore, professional competence in this area is essential for nurses and nursing students. Also, spiritual intelligence is a factor influencing the caring behaviors of nurses.\nA cross-sectional and correlational study SETTINGS/PARTICIPANTS: This study was included 510 undergraduate nursing students in two public faculties of nursing in Iran in the 2018-2019 academic year.\nThe samples were selected using a census method. A demographic information questionnaire, the valid and reliable Iranian questionnaire of nurses' competencies in spiritual care and the spiritual intelligence self-report inventory (SISRI) were used to collect data.\nA significant positive correlation was found between nursing students' competence in spiritual care and spiritual intelligence (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001, r\u00a0=\u00a00.26). No significant differences were found between the mean competence scores of spiritual care in terms of demographic characteristics. There were significant differences between the mean spiritual intelligence score in terms of age, marital status, history of clinical practice and academic year. The regression model indicated that for increased rates of spiritual intelligence, professional competence in spiritual care would rise as much as 0.39.\nSpiritual intelligence can affect the competence of nursing students in providing spiritual care to patients. Therefore, to promote students' spiritual intelligence, appropriate plans with the aim of promoting the level of critical thinking and spiritual self-awareness are recommended.", "Diagnostic decision support systems (DDSS) are computer programs aimed to improve health care by supporting clinicians in the process of diagnostic decision-making. Previous studies on DDSS demonstrated their ability to enhance clinicians' diagnostic skills, prevent diagnostic errors, and reduce hospitalization costs. Despite the potential benefits, their utilization in clinical practice is limited, emphasizing the need for new and improved products.\nThe aim of this study was to conduct a preliminary analysis of the diagnostic performance of \"Kahun,\" a new artificial intelligence-driven diagnostic tool.\nDiagnostic performance was evaluated based on the program's ability to \"solve\" clinical cases from the United States Medical Licensing Examination Step 2 Clinical Skills board exam simulations that were drawn from the case banks of 3 leading preparation companies. Each case included 3 expected differential diagnoses. The cases were entered into the Kahun platform by 3 blinded junior physicians. For each case, the presence and the rank of the correct diagnoses within the generated differential diagnoses list were recorded. Each diagnostic performance was measured in two ways: first, as diagnostic sensitivity, and second, as case-specific success rates that represent diagnostic comprehensiveness.\nThe study included 91 clinical cases with 78 different chief complaints and a mean number of 38 (SD 8) findings for each case. The total number of expected diagnoses was 272, of which 174 were different (some appeared more than once). Of the 272 expected diagnoses, 231 (87.5%; 95% CI 76-99) diagnoses were suggested within the top 20 listed diagnoses, 209 (76.8%; 95% CI 66-87) were suggested within the top 10, and 168 (61.8%; 95% CI 52-71) within the top 5. The median rank of correct diagnoses was 3 (IQR 2-6). Of the 91 expected diagnoses, 62 (68%; 95% CI 59-78) of the cases were suggested within the top 20 listed diagnoses, 44 (48%; 95% CI 38-59) within the top 10, and 24 (26%; 95% CI 17-35) within the top 5. Of the 91 expected diagnoses, in 87 (96%; 95% CI 91-100), at least 2 out of 3 of the cases' expected diagnoses were suggested within the top 20 listed diagnoses; 78 (86%; 95% CI 79-93) were suggested within the top 10; and 61 (67%; 95% CI 57-77) within the top 5.\nThe diagnostic support tool evaluated in this study demonstrated good diagnostic accuracy and comprehensiveness; it also had the ability to manage a wide range of clinical findings.", "This overview addresses some opportunities and risks of digital transformation in their significance for the diagnostics and therapy of mental illnesses under the aspect of the convergence of new digital technologies.

Mood disorders increase the risk of suicide, making it imperative to diagnose and treat these disorders quickly. Artificial intelligence (AI) has been investigated for diagnosing mood disorders, but the merits of the literature have not been evaluated. This systematic review aims to understand and explain AI methods and evaluate their use in augmenting clinical diagnosis of mood disorders as well as identifying individuals at increased suicide risk.\nWe conducted a systematic literature review of all studies until August 1, 2020 examining the efficacy of different AI techniques for diagnosing mood disorders and identifying individuals at increased suicide risk because of a mood disorder.\nOur literature search generated 13 studies (10 of mood disorders and 3 describing suicide risk) where AI techniques were used. Machine learning and artificial neural networks were most commonly used; both showed merit in helping to diagnose mood disorders and assess suicide risk.\nThe data shows that AI methods have merit in improving the diagnosis of mood disorders as well as identifying suicide risk. More research is needed for bipolar disorder because only 2 studies explored this condition, and it is often misdiagnosed. Although only a few AI techniques are discussed in detail in this review, there are many more that can be employed, and should be evaluated in future studies.", "Letters of recommendation (LoRs) play an important role in resident selection. Author language varies implicitly toward male and female applicants. We examined gender bias in LoRs written for surgical residency candidates across three decades at one institution.\nRetrospective analysis of LoRs written for general surgery residency candidates between 1980 and 2011 using artificial intelligence (AI) to conduct natural language processing (NLP) and sentiment analysis, and computer-based algorithms to detect gender bias. Applicants were grouped by scaled clerkship grades and USMLE scores. Data were analyzed among groups with t-tests, ANOVA, and non-parametric tests, as appropriate.\nA total of 611 LoRs were analyzed for 171 applicants (16.4% female), and 95.3% of letter authors were male. Scaled USMLE scores and clerkship grades (SCG) were similar for both genders (p\u00a0>\u00a00.05 for both). Average word count for all letters was 290 words and was not significantly different between genders (p\u00a0=\u00a00.18). LoRs written before 2000 were significantly shorter than those written after, among applicants of both genders (female p\u00a0=\u00a00.004; male p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Gender bias analysis of female LoRs revealed more gendered wording compared to male LoRs (p\u00a0=\u00a00.04) and was most prominent among females with lower SCG (9.5 vs 5.1, p\u00a0=\u00a00.01). Sentiment analysis revealed male LoRs with female authors had significantly more positive sentiment compared to female LoRs (p\u00a0=\u00a00.02), and males with higher SCG had more positive sentiment compared to those with lower SCG (9.4 vs 8.2, p\u00a0=\u00a00.03). NLP detected more \"fear\" in male LoRs with lower SCGs (0.11 vs 0.09, p\u00a0=\u00a00.02). Female LoRs with higher SCGs had more positive sentiment (0.78 vs 0.83, p\u00a0=\u00a00.03) and \"joy\" (0.60 vs 0.63, p\u00a0=\u00a00.02), although those written before 2000 had less \"joy\" (0.5 vs 0.63, p\u00a0=\u00a00.006).\nAI and computer-based algorithms detected linguistic differences and gender bias in LoRs written for general surgery residency applicants, even following stratification by clerkship grades and when analyzed by decade.", "The application of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies as a diagnostic aid in healthcare is increasing. Benefits include applications to improve health systems, such as rapid and accurate interpretation of medical images. This may improve the performance of diagnostic, prognostic and management decisions. While a large amount of work has been undertaken discussing the role of AI little is understood regarding the performance of such applications in the clinical setting. This systematic review aims to critically appraise the diagnostic performance of AI algorithms to identify disease from cross-sectional radiological images of the abdominopelvic cavity, to identify current limitations and inform future research.\nA systematic search will be conducted on Medline, EMBASE and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials to identify relevant studies. Primary studies where AI-based technologies have been used as a diagnostic aid in cross-sectional radiological images of the abdominopelvic cavity will be included. Diagnostic accuracy of AI models, including reported sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, likelihood ratios and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve will be examined and compared with standard practice. Risk of bias of included studies will be assessed using the QUADAS-2 tool. Findings will be reported according to the Synthesis Without Meta-analysis guidelines.\nNo ethical approval is required as primary data will not be collected. The results will inform further research studies in this field. Findings will be disseminated at relevant conferences, on social media and published in a peer-reviewed journal.\nCRD42021237249.", "COVID-19 has produced a global pandemic affecting all over of the world. Prediction of the rate of COVID-19 spread and modeling of its course have critical impact on both health system and policy makers. Indeed, policy making depends on judgments formed by the prediction models to propose new strategies and to measure the efficiency of the imposed policies. Based on the nonlinear and complex nature of this disorder and difficulties in estimation of virus transmission features using traditional epidemic models, artificial intelligence methods have been applied for prediction of its spread. Based on the importance of machine and deep learning approaches in the estimation of COVID-19 spreading trend, in the present study, we review studies which used these strategies to predict the number of new cases of COVID-19. Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system, long short-term memory, recurrent neural network and multilayer perceptron are among the mostly used strategies in this regard. We compared the performance of several machine learning methods in prediction of COVID-19 spread. Root means squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), R2 coefficient of determination (R2), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) parameters were selected as performance measures for comparison of the accuracy of models. R2 values have ranged from 0.64 to 1 for artificial neural network (ANN) and Bidirectional long short-term memory (LSTM), respectively. Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and Multilayer perceptron (MLP) have also have R2 values near 1. ARIMA and LSTM had the highest MAPE values. Collectively, these models are capable of identification of learning parameters that affect dissimilarities in COVID-19 spread across various regions or populations, combining numerous intervention methods and implementing what-if scenarios by integrating data from diseases having analogous trends with COVID-19. Therefore, application of these methods would help in precise policy making to design the most appropriate interventions and avoid non-efficient restrictions.", "Prescriptive and predictive analytics and artificial intelligence (AI) provide tools to analyze data with objectivity. In this paper, we provide an overview of how these techniques can improve nursing care, and we detail a quantitative model to afford managerial insights about care management in a Hospital in Colombia. Our main purpose is to provide tools to improve key performance indicators for the care management of inpatients which includes the nurse workload.\nThe optimal nurse-to-patient assignment problem is addressed using analytics, lean health care, and AI. Also, we propose a new mathematical model to optimize the nurse-to-patient assignment decisions considering several variables about the patient state such as the Barthel index, their risks, the complexity of the care, and the mental state.\nOur results show that there are several processes inherent to compassionate nursing care that can be improved using technology. By using data analytics, we can also provide insights about the high variability of the care requirements and, by using models, find nurse-to-patient assignments that are nearly perfectly balanced.\nWe illustrated this improvement with a pilot test that makes the equitable distribution of nursing workload the functionality of this strategy. The findings can be useful in highly complex hospitals in Latin America.\nThe proposed model presents an opportunity to make near perfectly balanced nurse-to-patient assignments according to the number of patients and their health conditions using technology.", "The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has wreaked havoc across the world. It also created a need for the urgent development of efficacious predictive diagnostics, specifically, artificial intelligence (AI) methods applied to medical imaging. This has led to the convergence of experts from multiple disciplines to solve this global pandemic including clinicians, medical physicists, imaging scientists, computer scientists, and informatics experts to bring to bear the best of these fields for solving the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, such a convergence over a very brief period of time has had unintended consequences and created its own challenges. As part of Medical Imaging Data and Resource Center initiative, we discuss the lessons learned from career transitions across the three involved disciplines (radiology, medical imaging physics, and computer science) and draw recommendations based on these experiences by analyzing the challenges associated with each of the three associated transition types: (1)\u00a0AI of non-imaging data to AI of medical imaging data, (2)\u00a0medical imaging clinician to AI of medical imaging, and (3)\u00a0AI of medical imaging to AI of COVID-19 imaging. The lessons learned from these career transitions and the diffusion of knowledge among them could be accomplished more effectively by recognizing their associated intricacies. These lessons learned in the transitioning to AI in the medical imaging of COVID-19 can inform and enhance future AI applications, making the whole of the transitions more than the sum of each discipline, for confronting an emergency like the COVID-19 pandemic or solving emerging problems in biomedicine.", "On the internet, artificial intelligence has grown to become a program with codes and algorithms that learn and reprogram themselves to carry out pre-established tasks with greater efficiency; although this translates into improvements, the scope of the results and reprogramming are unknown to the programmer. Given the risk of deviation from pre-established objectives and ethical regulations, filters must be installed at the beginning, during and at the end of the process, as alarms for detecting deviations with bioethical implications. The interaction of human intelligence with artificial intelligence has had negative and positive disagreements. Initially, adapting regulations, labor laws and human rights was enough; now it is necessary for ethical standards to be established, such as those formulated in the Barcelona Declaration for the Proper Development and Usage of Artificial Intelligence in Europe.\nEn internet ha crecido la inteligencia artificial hasta convertirse en un programa con c\u00f3digos y algoritmos que aprenden y se reprograman para efectuar tareas preestablecidas con mayor eficiencia; si bien lo anterior se traduce en mejor\u00eda, el programador desconoce los alcances de los resultados y de la reprogramaci\u00f3n. Ante el riesgo de desviaci\u00f3n de los objetivos preestablecidos y de los reglamentos \u00e9ticos, se tienen que implementar filtros al inicio, durante y al final del proceso, como alarmas cuando existan desviaciones con implicaci\u00f3n bio\u00e9tica. La interacci\u00f3n de la inteligencia humana con la inteligencia artificial ha tenido desencuentros negativos y positivos. Al principio, bast\u00f3 con adecuar normas, leyes laborales y derechos humanos; ahora se requiere establecer normas \u00e9ticas, como las formuladas en la Declaraci\u00f3n de Barcelona para el Adecuado Desarrollo y Uso de la Inteligencia Artificial en Europa.", "Computed tomography was one of the first imaging modalities to require a computerized solution of an inverse problem to produce a useful image from the data acquired by the sensor hardware. The computerized solutions, which are known as image reconstruction algorithms, have thus been a critical component of every CT scanner ever sold. We review the history of commercially deployed CT reconstruction algorithms and consider the forces that led, at various points, both to innovation and to convergence around certain broadly useful algorithms. The forces include the emergence of new hardware capabilities, competitive pressures, the availability of computational power, and regulatory considerations. We consider four major historical periods and turning points. The original EMI scanner was developed with an iterative reconstruction algorithm, but an explosion of innovation coupled with rediscovery of an older literature led to the development of alternative algorithms throughout the early 1970s. Most CT vendors quickly converged on the use of the filtered back-projection (FBP) algorithm, albeit layered with a variety of proprietary corrections in both projection data and image domains to improve image quality. Innovations such as helical scanning and multi-row detectors were both enabled by and drove the development of additional applications of FBP in the 1990s and 2000s. Finally, the last two decades have seen a return of iterative reconstruction and the introduction of artificial intelligence approaches that benefit from increased computational power to reduce radiation dose and improve image quality.", "Gaucher disease (GD) is a rare lysosomal storage disorder that is divided into three subtypes based on presentation of neurological manifestations. Distinguishing between the types has important implications for treatment and counseling. Yet, patients with neuronopathic forms of GD, types 2 and 3, often present at young ages and can have overlapping phenotypes. It has been shown that new technologies employing artificial intelligence and facial recognition software can assist with dysmorphology assessments. Though classically not associated nor previously described with a dysmorphic facial phenotype, this study investigated whether a facial recognition platform could distinguish between photos of patients with GD2 and GD3 and discriminate between them and photos of healthy controls. Each cohort included over 100 photos. A cross validation scheme including a series of binary comparisons between groups was used. Outputs included a composite photo of each cohort and either a receiver operating characteristic curve or a confusion matrix. Binary comparisons showed that the software could correctly group photos at least 89% of the time. Multiclass comparison between GD2, GD3, and healthy controls demonstrated a mean accuracy of 76.6%, compared to a 37.7% chance for random comparison. Both GD2 and GD3 have now been added to the facial recognition platform as established syndromes that can be identified by the algorithm. These results suggest that facial recognition and artificial intelligence, though no substitute for other diagnostic methods, may aid in the recognition of neuronopathic GD. The algorithm, in concert with other clinical features, also appears to distinguish between young patients with GD2 and GD3, suggesting that this tool can help facilitate earlier implementation of appropriate management.", "Clinical interpretation of genetic variants in the context of the patient's phenotype is becoming the largest component of cost and time expenditure for genome-based diagnosis of rare genetic diseases. Artificial intelligence (AI) holds promise to greatly simplify and speed genome interpretation by integrating predictive methods with the growing knowledge of genetic disease. Here we assess the diagnostic performance of Fabric GEM, a new, AI-based, clinical decision support tool for expediting genome interpretation.\nWe benchmarked GEM in a retrospective cohort of 119 probands, mostly NICU infants, diagnosed with rare genetic diseases, who received whole-genome or whole-exome sequencing (WGS, WES). We replicated our analyses in a separate cohort of 60 cases collected from five academic medical centers. For comparison, we also analyzed these cases with current state-of-the-art variant prioritization tools. Included in the comparisons were trio, duo, and singleton cases. Variants underpinning diagnoses spanned diverse modes of inheritance and types, including structural variants (SVs). Patient phenotypes were extracted from clinical notes by two means: manually and using an automated clinical natural language processing (CNLP) tool. Finally, 14 previously unsolved cases were reanalyzed.\nGEM ranked over 90% of the causal genes among the top or second candidate and prioritized for review a median of 3 candidate genes per case, using either manually curated or CNLP-derived phenotype descriptions. Ranking of trios and duos was unchanged when analyzed as singletons. In 17 of 20 cases with diagnostic SVs, GEM identified the causal SVs as the top candidate and in 19/20 within the top five, irrespective of whether SV calls were provided or inferred ab initio by GEM using its own internal SV detection algorithm. GEM showed similar performance in absence of parental genotypes. Analysis of 14 previously unsolved cases resulted in a novel finding for one case, candidates ultimately not advanced upon manual review for 3 cases, and no new findings for 10 cases.\nGEM enabled diagnostic interpretation inclusive of all variant types through automated nomination of a very short list of candidate genes and disorders for final review and reporting. In combination with deep phenotyping by CNLP, GEM enables substantial automation of genetic disease diagnosis, potentially decreasing cost and expediting case review.", "Annually in England, over 1.5 million children and young people (CYP) are admitted to hospital. However, a proportion of these CYP will experience failure to rescue (FtR), a failure to recognize, respond and escalate clinical deterioration, which can result in significant harm or death.\nTo identify and quantify FtR episodes from emergency events at a 110-bedded tertiary children's hospital located within a University Teaching Hospital and evaluate the impact of targeted interventions on reducing FtR.\nA quality improvement approach was adopted. From 170\u2009446 patients admitted between 2011 and 2019, all emergency event calls were systematically reviewed to identify FtR episodes. Root-cause analysis was performed to identify practice deficiencies. The Plan-Do-Study-Act fundamentals were used.\nA total of 520 emergency events were reviewed over the 9-year period. One hundred and thirty-two (n\u00a0=\u00a0132; 25%) were cardiac arrest events, with the majority occurring within the PCCU setting. Three hundred and twelve (60%) of the events were in children who had been inpatient for more than 48\u2009hours. FtR trend declined over the study period from 23.6% in 2011 when the project commenced to 2.5% or less over the following 8\u2009years.\nIdentifying rates of FtR events from routinely collected emergency events data can be used as a patient safety measure to identify emergency concerns. This enables dynamic problem solving through delivery of strategic and targeted interventions. The proposed interventions outlined in this quality improvement study have application to critical care nursing as mechanisms for reducing unplanned admissions to paediatric critical care unit (PCCU), patient mortality, and PCCU and non-PCCU cardiac arrests.\nThis study emphasises the importance in understanding the antecedence of emergency events for paediatric inpatient populations. This intelligence can be used to direct targeted interventions to significantly reduce failure to rescue rates.", "In the last years, the widespread use of the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) blood examination to triage patients who will enter the diagnostic/therapeutic path for prostate cancer (PCa) has almost halved PCa-specific mortality. As a counterpart, millions of men with clinically insignificant cancer not destined to cause death are treated, with no beneficial impact on overall survival. Therefore, there is a compelling need to develop tools that can help in stratifying patients according to their risk, to support physicians in the selection of the most appropriate treatment option for each individual patient. The aim of this study was to develop and validate on multivendor data a fully automated computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system to detect and characterize PCas according to their aggressiveness. We propose a CAD system based on artificial intelligence algorithms that a) registers all images coming from different MRI sequences, b) provides candidates suspicious to be tumor, and c) provides an aggressiveness score of each candidate based on the results of a support vector machine classifier fed with radiomics features. The dataset was composed of 131 patients (149 tumors) from two different institutions that were divided in a training set, a narrow validation set, and an external validation set. The algorithm reached an area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve in distinguishing between low and high aggressive tumors of 0.96 and 0.81 on the training and validation sets, respectively. Moreover, when the output of the classifier was divided into three classes of risk, i.e., indolent, indeterminate, and aggressive, our method did not classify any aggressive tumor as indolent, meaning that, according to our score, all aggressive tumors would undergo treatment or further investigations. Our CAD performance is superior to that of previous studies and overcomes some of their limitations, such as the need to perform manual segmentation of the tumor or the fact that analysis is limited to single-center datasets. The results of this study are promising and could pave the way to a prediction tool for personalized decision making in patients harboring PCa.", "In medicine, particularly in radiology, there are great expectations in artificial intelligence (AI), which can \"see\" more than human radiologists in regard to, for example, tumor size, shape, morphology, texture and kinetics - thus enabling better care by earlier detection or more precise reports. Another point is that AI can handle large data sets in high-dimensional spaces. But it should not be forgotten that AI is only as good as the training samples available, which should ideally be numerous enough to cover all variants. On the other hand, the main feature of human intelligence is content knowledge and the ability to find near-optimal solutions. The purpose of this paper is to review the current complexity of radiology working places, to describe their advantages and shortcomings. Further, we give an AI overview of the different types and features as used so far. We also touch on the differences between AI and human intelligence in problem-solving. We present a new AI type, labeled \"explainable AI,\" which should enable a balance/cooperation between AI and human intelligence - thus bringing both worlds in compliance with legal requirements. For support of (pediatric) radiologists, we propose the creation of an AI assistant that augments radiologists and keeps their brain free for generic tasks.", "Assistive technology (AT) with context-aware computing and artificial intelligence capabilities can be applied to address cognitive and communication impairments experienced by persons with dementia (PwD). This paper aims to provide an overview of current literature regarding some characteristics of intelligent assistive technology devices (IATDs) for cognitive and communicative impairments of PwD. It also aims to identify the areas of impairment addressed by these IATDs.A multi-faceted systematic search strategy yielded records. Predefined criteria were applied for inclusion and data extraction. Thereafter data was thematically analysed and synthesised. This review demonstrates that almost all of the research involving IATDs has focused on cognitive impairments of PwD and has not yet evolved past the conceptual or prototype stages of development. Summaries of commercially available IATDs for PwD and relevant prototypes are provided at the end of this review.This research concluded that IATDs for PwD targeting cognition and communication problems primarily focus on social robots, and that they address cognitive impairments of attention, affect, and social-pragmatic communicative impairments. Future research endeavours concerning AT for PwD should explore collaboration between computer engineering and health practitioners to address the identified gaps. This may contribute to the available information for evidence-based decision making for PwD.", "Radiation therapists must possess adaptable communication skills to manage patient-centred care and provide required technical information. Adaptive communication is also an expectation of undergraduate students to gain registration in Australia. The University Of Newcastle's Clinical Reasoning Module (CRM) prepares first-year radiation therapy students for clinical interactions. This research aims to reveal the lived experience of students after completing their first clinical placement.\nAn interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) approach was the chosen methodology. Audio-recorded semi-structured interviews were conducted with first-year students who had completed the CRM and attended their first placement. Two independent reviewers analysed each data set separately before discussing and agreeing on, and arranging themes into clusters to reveal substantive and sub-themes.\nFour students were interviewed. Five substantive themes were revealed; 'making sense of the CRM', 'the inner self',' the art of communication', 'the student as a learner' and 'clinical work'. Students' varied clinical experiences were evident, and the interviews allowed a de-brief mechanism. Students related the CRM to the clinical environment and revealed unexpected reactions and emotional responses during their placement. Examples include disclosing the reluctance of patients to interact and talking about dying, which became their new normal.\nThis review allowed an opportunity to inquire into the lived experiences of radiation therapy students navigating their way through the clinical environment. Differences between student's emotional intelligence and level of communication reflected their ability to make sense of their experiences in the clinical setting.\nWhile students appeared satisfied with the CRM in preparing them for clinical placement, providing regular de-brief sessions and reviewing clinical practice guidelines to better prepare for psycho-social issues encountered is recommended for overall student well-being.", "Burn-related injuries are a leading cause of morbidity across the globe. Accurate assessment and treatment have been demonstrated to reduce the morbidity and mortality. This essay explores the forms of artificial intelligence to be implemented the field of burns management to optimize the care we deliver in the National Health Service (NHS) in the United Kingdom. Machine learning methods that predict or classify are explored. This includes linear and logistic regression, artificial neural networks, deep learning, and decision tree analysis. Utilizing machine learning in burns care holds potential from prevention, burns assessment, predicting mortality, and critical care monitoring to healing time. Establishing a regional or national Machine Learning group would be the first step toward the development of these essential technologies. The implementation of machine learning technologies will require buy-in from the NHS health boards, with significant implications with cost of investment, implementation, employment of machine learning teams, and provision of training to medical professionals.", "In the past decade, the emergence of machine learning (ML) applications has led to significant advances towards implementation of personalised medicine approaches for improved health care, due to the exceptional performance of ML models when utilising complex big data. The immune-mediated chronic inflammatory diseases are a group of complex disorders associated with dysregulated immune responses resulting in inflammation affecting various organs and systems. The heterogeneous nature of these diseases poses great challenges for tailored disease management and addressing unmet patient needs. Applying novel ML techniques to the clinical study of chronic inflammatory diseases shows promising results and great potential for precision medicine applications in clinical research and practice. In this review, we highlight the clinical applications of various ML techniques for prediction, diagnosis and prognosis of autoimmune rheumatic diseases, inflammatory bowel disease, autoimmune chronic kidney disease, and multiple sclerosis, as well as ML applications for patient stratification and treatment selection. We highlight the use of ML in drug development, including target identification, validation and drug repurposing, as well as challenges related to data interpretation and validation, and ethical concerns related to the use of artificial intelligence in clinical research.", "While adoption studies have provided key insights into the influence of the familial environment on IQ scores of adolescents and children, few have followed adopted offspring long past the time spent living in the family home. To improve confidence about the extent to which shared environment exerts enduring effects on IQ, we estimated genetic and environmental effects on adulthood IQ in a unique sample of 486 biological and adoptive families. These families, tested previously on measures of IQ when offspring averaged age 15, were assessed a second time nearly two decades later ( M offspring age = 32 years). We estimated the proportions of the variance in IQ attributable to environmentally mediated effects of parental IQs, sibling-specific shared environment, and gene-environment covariance to be .01 [95% CI .00, .02], .04 [95% CI .00, .15], and .03 [95% CI .00, .07] respectively; these components jointly accounted for 8 percent of the IQ variance in adulthood. The heritability was estimated to be .42 [95% CI .21, .64]. Together, these findings provide further evidence for the predominance of genetic influences on adult intelligence over any other systematic source of variation.", "Bacteria are important in a variety of practical domains, including industry, agriculture, medicine etc. A very few species of bacteria are favourable to humans. Whereas, majority of them are extremely dangerous and causes variety of life threatening illness to different living organisms. Traditionally, this class of microbes is detected and classified using different approaches like gram staining, biochemical testing, motility testing etc. However with the availability of large amount of data and technical advances in the field of medical and computer science, the machine learning methods have been widely used and have shown tremendous performance in automatic detection of bacteria. The inclusion of latest technology employing different Artificial Intelligence techniques are greatly assisting microbiologist in solving extremely complex problems in this domain. This paper presents a review of the literature on various machine learning approaches that have been used to classify bacteria, for the period 1998-2020. The resources include research papers and book chapters from different publishers of national and international repute such as Elsevier, Springer, IEEE, PLOS, etc. The study carried out a detailed and critical analysis of penetrating different Machine learning methodologies in the field of bacterial classification along with their limitations and future scope. In addition, different opportunities and challenges in implementing these techniques in the concerned field are also presented to provide a deep insight to the researchers working in this field.", "Background: Recently, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has affected more than 200 countries and lead to enormous losses. This study systematically reviews the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques in COVID-19, especially for diagnosis, estimation of epidemic trends, prognosis, and exploration of effective and safe drugs and vaccines; and discusses the potential limitations. Methods: We report this systematic review following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. We searched PubMed, Embase and the Cochrane Library from inception to 19 September 2020 for published studies of AI applications in COVID-19. We used PROBAST (prediction model risk of bias assessment tool) to assess the quality of literature related to the diagnosis and prognosis of COVID-19. We registered the protocol (PROSPERO CRD42020211555). Results: We included 78 studies: 46 articles discussed AI-assisted diagnosis for COVID-19 with total accuracy of 70.00 to 99.92%, sensitivity of 73.00 to 100.00%, specificity of 25 to 100.00%, and area under the curve of 0.732 to 1.000. Fourteen articles evaluated prognosis based on clinical characteristics at hospital admission, such as clinical, laboratory and radiological characteristics, reaching accuracy of 74.4 to 95.20%, sensitivity of 72.8 to 98.00%, specificity of 55 to 96.87% and AUC of 0.66 to 0.997 in predicting critical COVID-19. Nine articles used AI models to predict the epidemic of the COVID-19, such as epidemic peak, infection rate, number of infected cases, transmission laws, and development trend. Eight articles used AI to explore potential effective drugs, primarily through drug repurposing and drug development. Finally, 1 article predicted vaccine targets that have the potential to develop COVID-19 vaccines. Conclusions: In this review, we have shown that AI achieved high performance in diagnosis, prognosis evaluation, epidemic prediction and drug discovery for COVID-19. AI has the potential to enhance significantly existing medical and healthcare system efficiency during the COVID-19 pandemic.", "In 1955, when John McCarthy and his colleagues proposed their first study of artificial intelligence, they suggested that 'every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can in principle be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it'. Whether that might ever be possible would depend on how we define intelligence, but what is indisputable is that new methods are needed to analyse and interpret the copious information provided by digital medical images, genomic databases, and biobanks. Technological advances have enabled applications of artificial intelligence (AI) including machine learning (ML) to be implemented into clinical practice, and their related scientific literature is exploding. Advocates argue enthusiastically that AI will transform many aspects of clinical cardiovascular medicine, while sceptics stress the importance of caution and the need for more evidence. This report summarizes the main opposing arguments that were presented in a debate at the 2021 Congress of the European Society of Cardiology. Artificial intelligence is an advanced analytical technique that should be considered when conventional statistical methods are insufficient, but testing a hypothesis or solving a clinical problem-not finding another application for AI-remains the most important objective. Artificial intelligence and ML methods should be transparent and interpretable, if they are to be approved by regulators and trusted to provide support for clinical decisions. Physicians need to understand AI methods and collaborate with engineers. Few applications have yet been shown to have a positive impact on clinical outcomes, so investment in research is essential.", "Detection and prediction of the novel Coronavirus present new challenges for the medical research community due to its widespread across the globe. Methods driven by Artificial Intelligence can help predict specific parameters, hazards, and outcomes of such a pandemic. Recently, deep learning-based approaches have proven a novel opportunity to determine various difficulties in prediction. In this work, two learning algorithms, namely deep learning and reinforcement learning, were developed to forecast COVID-19. This article constructs a model using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), particularly the Modified Long Short-Term Memory (MLSTM) model, to forecast the count of newly affected individuals, losses, and cures in the following few days. This study also suggests deep learning reinforcement to optimize COVID-19's predictive outcome based on symptoms. Real-world data was utilized to analyze the success of the suggested system. The findings show that the established approach promises prognosticating outcomes concerning the current COVID-19 pandemic and outperformed the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model and the Machine Learning model, Logistic Regresion (LR) in terms of error rate.", "We aimed to assess the impact of an artificial intelligence (AI)-based diagnostic-support software for proximal caries detection on bitewing radiographs.\nA cluster-randomized cross-over controlled trial was conducted. A commercially available software employing a fully convolutional neural network for caries detection (dentalXrai Pro, dentalXrai Ltd.) was randomly employed by 22 dentists, supporting their caries detection on 20 bitewings randomly chosen from a pool of 140 bitewings, with 10 bitewings randomly being supported by AI and 10 not. The reference test had been established by 4\u00a0+\u00a01 independent experts in a pixelwise fashion. Caries was subgrouped as enamel, early dentin and advanced dentin caries, and accuracy and treatment decisions for each caries lesion assessed.\nDentists with AI showed a significantly higher mean (95% CI) area under the Receiver-Operating-Characteristics curve (0.89; 0.87-0.90) than those without AI (0.85; 0.83-0.86; p<0.05), mainly as their sensitivity was significantly higher (0.81; 0.74-0.87 compared with 0.72; 0.64-0.79; p<0.05) while the specificity was not significantly affected (p>0.05). This increase in sensitivity was found for enamel, but not early or advanced dentin lesions. Higher sensitivity came with an increase in non-invasive, but also invasive treatment decisions (p<0.05).\nAI can increase dentists' diagnostic accuracy but may also increase invasive treatment decisions.\nAI can increase dentists' diagnostic accuracy, mainly via increasing their sensitivity for detecting enamel lesions, but may also increase invasive therapy decisions. Differences in the effects of AI for different dentists should be explored, and dentists should be guided as to which therapy to choose when detecting caries lesions using AI support.", "The mental rotation task is a particular spatial skill that helps people process visual information and is associated with intelligence and academic performance. Previous studies have found consistent sex difference in mental rotation. However, the neural mechanism of the sex-related difference in mental rotation remains unclear. This study investigates the association between sex, mental rotation and the functional connectivity (FC) of resting-state networks (RSNs) to explore neural correlates of different mental rotation abilities between males and females. Compared with females, males performed better on the mental rotation test. The mental rotation scores were significantly correlated with the special FC between the default mode network (DMN) and salience network (SN). The results of the mediation analysis revealed that the special FC between the DMN and SN mediated the association between sex and mental rotation. Based on these findings, males had higher FC between the DMN and SN, which subsequently promoted their mental rotation performance. These results emphasized the importance of sex in spatial cognition studies of both healthy people and individuals with neuropsychiatric disorders and deepened our understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying sex difference in mental rotation.", "In this proof of concept study, a deep learning-based method for automatic analysis of digital mammograms (DM) as a tool to aid in assessment of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) treatment response in breast cancer (BC) was examined.\nBaseline DM from 453 patients receiving NACT between 2005 and 2019 were included in the study cohort. A deep learning system, using the aforementioned baseline DM, was developed to predict pathological complete response (pCR) in the surgical specimen after completion of NACT. Two image patches, one extracted around the detected tumour and the other from the corresponding position in the reference image, were fed into a classification network. For training and validation, 1485 images obtained from 400 patients were used, and the model was ultimately applied to a test set consisting of 53 patients.\nA total of 95 patients (21%) achieved pCR. The median patient age was 52.5\u00a0years (interquartile range 43.7-62.1), and 255 (56%) were premenopausal. The artificial intelligence (AI) model predicted the pCR as represented by the area under the curve of 0.71 (95% confidence interval 0.53-0.90; p\u2009=\u20090.035). The sensitivity was 46% at a fixed specificity of 90%.\nOur study describes an AI platform using baseline DM to predict BC patients' responses to NACT. The initial AI performance indicated\u00a0the potential to aid in clinical decision-making. In order to continue exploring the clinical utility of AI in predicting responses to NACT for BC, further research, including refining the methodology and a larger sample size, is warranted.\n\u2022 We aimed to answer the following question: Prior to initiation of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, can artificial intelligence (AI) applied to digital mammograms (DM) predict breast tumour response? \u2022 DMs contain information that AI can make use of for predicting pathological complete (pCR) response after neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer. \u2022 By developing an AI system designed to focus on relevant parts of the DM, fully automatic pCR prediction can be done well enough to potentially aid in clinical decision-making.", "Aim: To examine whether executive functions, and gross motor skills were predictors for school performance in children with DCD, with risk for DCD (r-DCD), and with typical development (TD).Methods: Participants were 63 children with DCD (Mage\u2009=\u20098.70, SDage\u2009=\u2009.64), 31 children with r-DCD (Mage\u2009=\u20098.90, SDage\u2009=\u20090.74), and 63 typical development children (Mage\u2009=\u20098.74, SDage\u2009=\u2009.63).

The medical interview has three goals: Acquiring accurate medical data about the patient and the etiology of symptoms and signs, learning about the patient's personality, culture, and beliefs, and creating and building trust with the patient. Reduced human resources in the medical system and increased crowding in the interview setting, such as the emergency room and outpatient clinics, have strengthened the need for high quality and efficient interviews that fulfils the three goals of the interview. This manuscript proposes a structured six methods that contribute to the quality and efficiency of the medical interview with special focus on learning about the patients' life and creating trust with him.\nDie Bedeutung und der Stellenwert des Anamnesegespr\u00e4chs sind durch bessere Bildgebungstechnologien, die webbasierte Medizin und die Nutzung k\u00fcnstlicher Intelligenz in den Hintergrund getreten.

High-quality data plays a critical role in algorithm development. Limited studies have explored factors that may influence the MLM algorithm performance in predicting spasticity severity level. The objectives of this study were to train and validate a MLM algorithm for spasticity assessment and determine the algorithm's prediction performance in predicting ambiguous spasticity datasets. Forty-seven persons with central nervous system pathology that fulfilled the inclusion and exclusion criteria were recruited. Four biomechanical properties of spasticity were obtained using off-the-shelf wearable sensors. The data were analyzed individually, and ambiguous datasets were separated. The acceptable inertial data were used to train and validate MLM in predicting spasticity. The trained and validated MLM algorithm was later deployed to predict the ambiguous spasticity datasets. A series of MLM were applied, including Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, and Random Forest. The MLM's performance accuracy of the validation data was 96%, 52%, and 72%, respectively. The validated MLM accuracy performance level predicting ambiguous datasets reduces to 20%, 23%, and 23%, respectively. This study elucidates data biases and variances of disease background, pathophysiological and anatomical factors that have to be considered in MLM training.", "The delivery of healthy babies is the primary goal of obstetric care. Many technologies have been developed to reduce both maternal and fetal risks for poor outcomes. For 50\u00a0years, electronic fetal monitoring (EFM) has been used extensively in labor attempting to prevent a large proportion of neonatal encephalopathy and cerebral palsy. However, even key opinion leaders admit that EFM has mostly failed to achieve this goal. We believe this situation emanates from a fundamental misunderstanding of differences between screening and diagnostic tests, considerable subjectivity and inter-observer variability in EFM interpretation, failure to address the pathophysiology of fetal compromise, and a tunnel vision focus. To address these suboptimal results, several iterations of increasingly sophisticated analyses have intended to improve the situation. We believe that part of the continuing problem is that the focus of EFM has been too narrow ignoring important contextual issues such as maternal, fetal, and obstetrical risk factors, and increased uterine contraction frequency. All of these can significantly impact the application of EFM to intrapartum care. We have recently developed a new clinical approach, the Fetal Reserve Index (FRI), contextualizing EFM interpretation. Our data suggest the FRI is capable of providing higher accuracy and earlier detection of emerging fetal compromise. Over time, artificial intelligence/machine learning approaches will likely improve measurements and interpretation of FHR characteristics and other relevant variables. Such future developments will allow us to develop more comprehensive models that increase the interpretability and utility of interfaces for clinical decision making during the intrapartum period.", "We investigated the performance improvement of physicians with varying levels of chest radiology experience when using a commercially available artificial intelligence (AI)-based computer-assisted detection (CAD) software to detect lung cancer nodules on chest radiographs from multiple vendors.\nChest radiographs and their corresponding chest CT were retrospectively collected from one institution between July 2017 and June 2018. Two author radiologists annotated pathologically proven lung cancer nodules on the chest radiographs while referencing CT. Eighteen readers (nine general physicians and nine radiologists) from nine institutions interpreted the chest radiographs. The readers interpreted the radiographs alone and then reinterpreted them referencing the CAD output. Suspected nodules were enclosed with a bounding box. These bounding boxes were judged correct if there was significant overlap with the ground truth, specifically, if the intersection over union was 0.3 or higher. The sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, PPV, and NPV of the readers' assessments were calculated.\nIn total, 312 chest radiographs were collected as a test dataset, including 59 malignant images (59 nodules of lung cancer) and 253 normal images. The model provided a modest boost to the reader's sensitivity, particularly helping general physicians. The performance of general physicians was improved from 0.47 to 0.60 for sensitivity, from 0.96 to 0.97 for specificity, from 0.87 to 0.90 for accuracy, from 0.75 to 0.82 for PPV, and from 0.89 to 0.91 for NPV while the performance of radiologists was improved from 0.51 to 0.60 for sensitivity, from 0.96 to 0.96 for specificity, from 0.87 to 0.90 for accuracy, from 0.76 to 0.80 for PPV, and from 0.89 to 0.91 for NPV. The overall increase in the ratios of sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, PPV, and NPV were 1.22 (1.14-1.30), 1.00 (1.00-1.01), 1.03 (1.02-1.04), 1.07 (1.03-1.11), and 1.02 (1.01-1.03) by using the CAD, respectively.\nThe AI-based CAD was able to improve the ability of physicians to detect nodules of lung cancer in chest radiographs. The use of a CAD model can indicate regions physicians may have overlooked during their initial assessment.", "Severe or life threatening infections are common among patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). Most infections in the ICU are bacterial or fungal in origin and require antimicrobial therapy for clinical resolution. Antibiotics are the cornerstone of therapy for infected critically ill patients. However, antibiotics are often not optimally administered resulting in less favorable patient outcomes including greater mortality. The timing of antibiotics in patients with life threatening infections including sepsis and septic shock is now recognized as one of the most important determinants of survival for this population. Individuals who have a delay in the administration of antibiotic therapy for serious infections can have a doubling or more in their mortality. Additionally, the timing of an appropriate antibiotic regimen, one that is active against the offending pathogens based on in vitro susceptibility, also influences survival. Thus not only is early empiric antibiotic administration important but the selection of those agents is crucial as well. The duration of antibiotic infusions, especially for \u03b2-lactams, can also influence antibiotic efficacy by increasing antimicrobial drug exposure for the offending pathogen. However, due to mounting antibiotic resistance, aggressive antimicrobial de-escalation based on microbiology results is necessary to counterbalance the pressures of early broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy. In this review, we examine time related variables impacting antibiotic optimization as it relates to the treatment of life threatening infections in the ICU. In addition to highlighting the importance of antibiotic timing in the ICU we hope to provide an approach to antimicrobials that also minimizes the unnecessary use of these agents. Such approaches will increasingly be linked to advances in molecular microbiology testing and artificial intelligence/machine learning. Such advances should help identify patients needing empiric antibiotic therapy at an earlier time point as well as the specific antibiotics required in order to avoid unnecessary administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics.", "Although multiple consensus statements have called for large-scale efforts to improve clinicians' communication skills regarding a variety of difficult conversations in medicine, this goal will be difficult to attain because there are no readily scalable, validated communication skills training programs for clinicians. However, novel applications of existing technologies and approaches grounded in learning science can overcome the scalability barriers. Moreover, future advances in virtual reality and artificial intelligence are likely to greatly enhance the possibilities for communication skills training programs. The purpose of this paper is to propose a scalable, theoretically grounded method to train clinicians in advanced communication skills in medicine. First, we summarize four key principles of adult learning relevant to communication skills training in medicine. Second, we discuss recommended practices to design effective technology-enhanced educational interventions, with an emphasis on achieving high amounts of user engagement. Third, we synthesize these principles into a framework for a web- and videoconference-based platform for teaching advanced communication skills in medicine. Once developed, this low-cost, scalable training platform has the potential to allow thousands of clinicians to acquire the advanced communication skills needed for difficult conversations in medicine.", "Three-dimensional printing (3DP) technology is an innovative tool used in manufacturing medical devices, producing alloys, replacing biological tissues, producing customized dosage forms and so on. Stereolithography (SLA), a 3D printing technique, is very rapid and highly accurate and produces finished products of uniform quality. 3D formulations have been optimized with a perfect tool of artificial intelligence learning techniques. Complex designs/shapes can be fabricated through SLA using the photopolymerization principle. Different 3DP technologies are introduced and the most promising of these, SLA, and its commercial applications, are focused on. The high speed and effectiveness of SLA are highlighted. The working principle of SLA, the materials used and applications of the technique in a wide range of different sectors are highlighted in this review. An innovative idea of 3D printing customized pharmaceutical dosage forms is also presented. SLA compromises several advantages over other methods, such as cost effectiveness, controlled integrity of materials and greater speed. The development of SLA has allowed the development of printed pharmaceutical devices. Considering the present trends, it is expected that SLA will be used along with conventional methods of manufacturing of 3D model. This 3D printing technology may be utilized as a novel tool for delivering drugs on demand. This review will be useful for researchers working on 3D printing technologies.", "The aim of this comprehensive paper is to acquaint the readers with evaluation of the retinal images using the arteficial intelligence (AI). Main focus of the paper is diabetic retinophaty (DR) screening. The basic principles of the artificial intelligence and algorithms that are already used in clinical practice or are shortly before approval will be described.\nDescribing the basic characteristics and mechanisms of different approaches to the use of AI and subsequently literary minireview clarifying the current state of knowledge in the area.\nModern systems for screening diabetic retinopathy using deep neural networks achieve a sensitivity and specificity of over 80 % in most published studies. The results of specific studies vary depending on the definition of the gold standard, number of images tested and on the evaluated parameters.\nEvaluation of images using AI will speed up and streamline the diagnosis of DR. The use of AI will allow to keep the quality of the eye care at least on the same level despite the raising number of the patients with diabetes.", "Applications using Artificial Intelligence (AI) have become commonplace and embedded in our daily lives. Much of our communication has transitioned from human-human interaction to human-technology or technology-mediated interaction. As technology is handed over control and streamlines choices and decision-making in different contexts, people are increasingly concerned about a potential threat to their autonomy. In this paper, we explore autonomy perception when interacting with AI-based applications in everyday contexts using a design fiction-based survey with 328 participants. We probed if providing users with explanations on \"why\" an application made certain choices or decisions influenced their perception of autonomy or reactance regarding the interaction with the applications. We also looked at changes in perception when users are aware of AI's presence in an application. In the social media context, we found that people perceived a greater reactance and lower sense of autonomy perhaps owing to the personal and identity-sensitive nature of the application context. Providing explanations on \"why\" in the navigation context, contributed to enhancing their autonomy perception, and reducing reactance since it influenced the users' subsequent actions based on the recommendation. We discuss our findings and the implications it has for the future development of everyday AI applications that respect human autonomy.", "Recent studies show the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) as a screening tool to detect COVID-19 pneumonia based on chest x-ray (CXR) images. However, issues on the datasets and study designs from medical and technical perspectives, as well as questions on the vulnerability and robustness of AI algorithms have emerged. In this study, we address these issues with a more realistic development of AI-driven COVID-19 pneumonia detection models by generating our own data through a retrospective clinical study to augment the dataset aggregated from external sources. We optimized five deep learning architectures, implemented development strategies by manipulating data distribution to quantitatively compare study designs, and introduced several detection scenarios to evaluate the robustness and diagnostic performance of the models. At the current level of data availability, the performance of the detection model depends on the hyperparameter tuning and has less dependency on the quantity of data. InceptionV3 attained the highest performance in distinguishing pneumonia from normal CXR in two-class detection scenario with sensitivity (Sn), specificity (Sp), and positive predictive value (PPV) of 96%. The models attained higher general performance of 91-96% Sn, 94-98% Sp, and 90-96% PPV in three-class compared to four-class detection scenario. InceptionV3 has the highest general performance with accuracy, F1-score, and g-mean of 96% in the three-class detection scenario. For COVID-19 pneumonia detection, InceptionV3 attained the highest performance with 86% Sn, 99% Sp, and 91% PPV with an AUC of 0.99 in distinguishing pneumonia from normal CXR. Its capability of differentiating COVID-19 pneumonia from normal and non-COVID-19 pneumonia attained 0.98 AUC and a micro-average of 0.99 for other classes.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) has seen dramatic growth over the past decade, evolving from a niche super specialty computer application into a powerful tool which has revolutionized many areas of our professional and daily lives, and the potential of which seems to be still largely untapped. The field of medicine and medical imaging, as one of its various specialties, has gained considerable benefit from AI, including improved diagnostic accuracy and the possibility of predicting individual patient outcomes and options of more personalized treatment. It should be noted that this process can actively support the ongoing development of advanced, highly specific treatment strategies (e.g., target therapies for cancer patients) while enabling faster workflow and more efficient use of healthcare resources. The potential advantages of AI over conventional methods have made it attractive for physicians and other healthcare stakeholders, raising much interest in both the research and the industry communities. However, the fast development of AI has unveiled its potential for disrupting the work of healthcare professionals, spawning concerns among radiologists that, in the future, AI may outperform them, thus damaging their reputations or putting their jobs at risk. Furthermore, this development has raised relevant psychological, ethical, and medico-legal issues which need to be addressed for AI to be considered fully capable of patient management. The aim of this review is to provide a brief, hopefully exhaustive, overview of the state of the art of AI systems regarding medical imaging, with a special focus on how AI and the entire healthcare environment should be prepared to accomplish the goal of a more advanced human-centered world.", "Edge Computing enables to perform measurement and cognitive decisions outside a central server by performing data storage, manipulation, and processing on the Internet of Things (IoT) node. Also, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning applications have become a rudimentary procedure in virtually every industrial or preliminary system. Consequently, the Raspberry Pi is adopted, which is a low-cost computing platform that is profitably applied in the field of IoT. As for the software part, among the plethora of Machine Learning (ML) paradigms reported in the literature, we identified Rulex, as a good ML platform, suitable to be implemented on the Raspberry Pi. In this paper, we present the porting of the Rulex ML platform on the board to perform ML forecasts in an IoT setup. Specifically, we explain the porting Rulex's libraries on Windows 32 Bits, Ubuntu 64 Bits, and Raspbian 32 Bits. Therefore, with the aim of carrying out an in-depth verification of the application possibilities, we propose to perform forecasts on five unrelated datasets from five different applications, having varying sizes in terms of the number of records, skewness, and dimensionality. These include a small Urban Classification dataset, three larger datasets concerning Human Activity detection, a Biomedical dataset related to mental state, and a Vehicle Activity Recognition dataset. The overall accuracies for the forecasts performed are: 84.13%, 99.29% (for SVM), 95.47% (for SVM), and 95.27% (For KNN) respectively. Finally, an image-based gender classification dataset is employed to perform image classification on the Edge. Moreover, a novel image pre-processing Algorithm was developed that converts images into Time-series by relying on statistical contour-based detection techniques. Even though the dataset contains inconsistent and random images, in terms of subjects and settings, Rulex achieves an overall accuracy of 96.47% while competing with the literature which is dominated by forward-facing and mugshot images. Additionally, power consumption for the Raspberry Pi in a Client/Server setup was compared with an HP laptop, where the board takes more time, but consumes less energy for the same ML task.", "Studying neuro-structural markers of intellectual giftedness (IG) will inform scientific understanding of the processes helping children excel academically.\nStructural and diffusion-weighted MRI was used to compare regional brain shape and connectivity of 12 children with average to high average IQ and 18 IG children, defined as having IQ greater than 145.\nIG had larger subcortical structures and more robust white matter microstructural organization between those structures in regions associated with explicit memory. TD had more connected, larger subcortical structures in regions associated with implicit memory.\nIt was found that the memory systems within brains of children with exceptional intellectual abilities are differently sized and connected compared to the brains of typically developing children. These different neurodevelopmental trajectories suggest different learning strategies. A spectrum of intelligence types is envisioned, facilitated by different ratios of implicit and explicit system, which was validated using a large external dataset.", "An intriguing challenge in the human-robot interaction field is the prospect of endowing robots with emotional intelligence to make the interaction more genuine, intuitive, and natural. A crucial aspect in achieving this goal is the robot's capability to infer and interpret human emotions. Thanks to its design and open programming platform, the NAO humanoid robot is one of the most widely used agents for human interaction. As with person-to-person communication, facial expressions are the privileged channel for recognizing the interlocutor's emotional expressions. Although NAO is equipped with a facial expression recognition module, specific use cases may require additional features and affective computing capabilities that are not currently available. This study proposes a highly accurate convolutional-neural-network-based facial expression recognition model that is able to further enhance the NAO robot' awareness of human facial expressions and provide the robot with an interlocutor's arousal level detection capability. Indeed, the model tested during human-robot interactions was 91% and 90% accurate in recognizing happy and sad facial expressions, respectively; 75% accurate in recognizing surprised and scared expressions; and less accurate in recognizing neutral and angry expressions. Finally, the model was successfully integrated into the NAO SDK, thus allowing for high-performing facial expression classification with an inference time of 0.34 \u00b1 0.04 s.", "The hospital catering service plays a decisive role in responding to clinical and nutritional needs and in providing food that is acceptable to patients. Unfortunately, at the moment, most hospital catering services provide a service deemed insufficient by users and are burdened by a high proportion of food waste that may negatively affect the nutritional and clinical status of patients. The aim of this study was to verify the efficacy of the NI-Nutritional Intelligence project in improving the nutritional and sensorial quality of hospital meals.\nThe study was conducted in the Cristo Re Hospital of Rome (Italy), where two different cooking techniques were compared: traditional procedures and the low-aggression gastronomic procedures of the Niko Romito Food Processing Technique. Data were collected on both objective (food waste) and subjective (customer satisfaction) evaluations of the food service.\nThe proportion of participants wasting at least 50% of dishes served dropped from 25.9% to 20% for the first course, from 32.8% to 20% for the main course, and from 29.3% to 20.4% for the side (P < 0.05 in all cases). Regarding customer satisfaction, the percentage of participants who gave a positive opinion on the variety of the menus gradually increased from 74.1% to 95% (P < 0.05). The same happened for opinions concerning the presentation of the dishes (smell, color, flavor): positive judgments went from 51.7% to 76% (P < 0.05). The overall scoring of the food service (0-10) went from 6.38 \u00b1 2.3 to 7.6 \u00b1 2.1 (P < 0.05).\nThe hospital catering service must be able to provide patients with meals with an adequate supply of energy and nutrients to allow them to recover their health and reduce hospital stays. The Nutritional Intelligence project, based on the gastronomic method proposed in the Niko Romito Food Processing Technique, significantly reduces food waste and improves customer satisfaction without imposing service costs related to catering staff and foodstuffs.", "More and more, the neurosciences and the sciences concerned with mind and cognition are burying fundamental questions under layers of professional methodology. I therefore welcome Biological Cybernetics' invitation to comment on two of my papers, (von\u00a0der Malsburg 1973) and (von\u00a0der Malsburg and Schneider 1986) (henceforth referred to as (I) and (II)) as an opportunity to address two fundamental questions about brain and mind: How is the brain's structure generated? and How is mental content expressed by the brain's physical states? Those two questions are deeply entangled with each other and play a kind of gateway role on the way to making progress with the issues of perception, intelligence, creativity and consciousness.", "Multimodal Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) techniques of Perfusion-Weighted Imaging (PWI) and Diffusion-Weighted Imaging (DWI) data are integral parts of the diagnostic workup in the acute stroke setting. The visual interpretation of PWI/DWI data is the most likely procedure to triage Acute Ischemic Stroke (AIS) patients who will access reperfusion therapy, especially in those exceeding 6\u00a0h of stroke onset. In fact, this process defines two classes of tissue: the ischemic core, which is presumed to be irreversibly damaged, visualized on DWI data and the penumbra which is the reversibly injured brain tissue around the ischemic tissue, visualized on PWI data. AIS patients with a large ischemic penumbra and limited infarction core have a high probability of benefiting from endovascular treatment. However, it is a tedious and time-consuming procedure. Consequently, it is subject to high inter- and intra-observer variability. Thus, the assessment of the potential risks and benefits of endovascular treatment is uncertain. Fast, accurate and automatic post-processing of PWI and DWI data is important for clinical diagnosis and is necessary to help the decision making for therapy. Therefore, an automated procedure that identifies stroke slices, stroke hemisphere, segments stroke regions in DWI, and measures hypoperfused tissue in PWI enhances considerably the reproducibility and the accuracy of stroke assessment. In this work, we draw an overview of several applications of Artificial Intelligence (AI) for the automation processing and their potential contributions in clinical practices. We compare the current approaches among each other's with respect to some key requirements.", "Background Advances in computer processing and improvements in data availability have led to the development of machine learning (ML) techniques for mammographic imaging. Purpose To evaluate the reported performance of stand-alone ML applications for screening mammography workflow. Materials and Methods Ovid Embase, Ovid Medline, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Scopus, and Web of Science literature databases were searched for relevant studies published from January 2012 to September 2020. The study was registered with the PROSPERO International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (protocol no. CRD42019156016). Stand-alone technology was defined as a ML algorithm that can be used independently of a human reader. Studies were quality assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 and the Prediction Model Risk of Bias Assessment Tool, and reporting was evaluated using the Checklist for Artificial Intelligence in Medical Imaging. A primary meta-analysis included the top-performing algorithm and corresponding reader performance from which pooled summary estimates for the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) were calculated using a bivariate model. Results Fourteen articles were included, which detailed 15 studies for stand-alone detection (n = 8) and triage (n = 7). Triage studies reported that 17%-91% of normal mammograms identified could be read by adapted screening, while \"missing\" an estimated 0%-7% of cancers. In total, an estimated 185\u2009252 cases from three countries with more than 39 readers were included in the primary meta-analysis. The pooled sensitivity, specificity, and AUC was 75.4% (95% CI: 65.6, 83.2; P = .11), 90.6% (95% CI: 82.9, 95.0; P = .40), and 0.89 (95% CI: 0.84, 0.98), respectively, for algorithms, and 73.0% (95% CI: 60.7, 82.6), 88.6% (95% CI: 72.4, 95.8), and 0.85 (95% CI: 0.78, 0.97), respectively, for readers. Conclusion Machine learning (ML) algorithms that demonstrate a stand-alone application in mammographic screening workflows achieve or even exceed human reader detection performance and improve efficiency. However, this evidence is from a small number of retrospective studies. Therefore, further rigorous independent external prospective testing of ML algorithms to assess performance at preassigned thresholds is required to support these claims. \u00a9RSNA, 2021 Online supplemental material is available for this article. See also the editorial by Whitman and Moseley in this issue.", "From the viewpoint of ultrasound (US) physicians, an ideal thyroid US computer-assisted diagnostic (CAD) system for thyroid cancer should perform well in suspicious thyroid nodules with atypical risk features and be able to output explainable results. This study aims to develop an explainable US CAD model for suspicious thyroid nodules.\nA total of 2992 solid or almost-solid thyroid nodules were analyzed retrospectively. All nodules had pathological results (1070 malignancies and 1992 benignities) confirmed by ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration cytology and histopathology after thyroidectomy. A deep learning model (ResNet50) and a multiple risk features learning ensemble model (XGBoost) were used to train the US images of 2794 thyroid nodules. Then, an integrated AI model was generated by combining both models. The diagnostic accuracies of the three AI models (ResNet50, XGBoost, and the integrated model) were predicted in a testing set including 198 thyroid nodules and compared to the diagnostic efficacy of five ultrasonographers.\nThe accuracy of the integrated model was 76.77%, while the mean accuracy of the ultrasonographers was 68.38%. Of the risk features, microcalcifications showed the highest contribution to the diagnosis of malignant nodules.\nThe integrated AI model in our study can improve the diagnostic accuracy of suspicious thyroid nodules and output the known risk features simultaneously, thus aiding in training young ultrasonographers by linking the explainable results to their clinical experience and advancing the acceptance of AI diagnosis for thyroid cancer in clinical practice.\n\u2022 We developed an artificial intelligence (AI) diagnosis model based on both deep learning and multiple risk feature ensemble learning methods. \u2022 The AI diagnosis model showed higher diagnostic accuracy for suspicious thyroid nodules than ultrasonographers. \u2022 The AI diagnosis model showed partial explainability by outputting the known risk features, thus aiding young ultrasonic doctors in increasing the diagnostic level for thyroid cancer.", "Drug repositioning (DR) is defined as determining new therapeutic applications for existing drugs. This approach is advantageous over de novo drug discovery in accelerating clinical development, in terms of lower costs, a shortened development period, a well-known action mechanism, a feasible dosage, and an acceptable safety profile.\nThis work was aimed at reviewing agents with successful DR in hematology.\nThalidomide and plerixafor have been successfully repositioned for treating multiple myeloma and harvesting peripheral blood stem cells, respectively. The former was originally developed as a sedative and the latter as an anti-HIV drug. Currently, the feasibility of repositioning various agents is being explored (e.g. an anti-influenza virus drug oseltamivir for primary immune thrombocytopenia, an anti-HIV drug abacavir for adult T-cell leukemia, and a macrolide antibiotic clarithromycin for multiple myeloma). Furthermore, bosutinib for chronic myeloid leukemia or the antiplatelet drug cilostazol have been suggested to have clinical benefits for the management of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and ischemic stroke, respectively. To promote DR, effective application of artificial intelligence or stem cell models, comprehensive database construction shared between academia and pharmaceutical companies, suitable handling of drug patents, and wide cooperation in the area of specialty are warranted.", "A large component of Neville Stanton's work has focused on situation awareness in domains such as defence, transport, and process control. A significant contribution has been to initiate a shift from considering individual human operator situation awareness to considering the situation awareness of human and non-human teams, organisations, and even sociotechnical systems. Though controversial when introduced, the distributed situation awareness model has become increasingly relevant for modern day systems and problems. In this article we reflect on Stanton's contribution and point to a pressing need to consider a. The situation awareness of advanced technologies, and b. situation awareness at a sociotechnical system, societal and even global level. This is demonstrated via discussion on two contemporaneous issues: automated vehicles and the COVID-19 pandemic. It is concluded that, given advances such as artificial intelligence, the increased connectedness of society, emerging issues such as disinformation, and an increasing set of global threats, Stanton's distributed situation awareness model and associated analysis framework provide a useful toolkit for future Human Factors and Ergonomics applications.", "Childhood adversity is a strong risk factor for the development of various psychopathologies including major depressive disorder (MDD). However, not all depressed patients experience early life trauma. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies using facial emotion processing tasks have documented altered blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) responses in specific cortico-limbic networks both in MDD patients and in individuals with a history of childhood maltreatment (CM). Therefore, a history of maltreatment may represent a key modulating factor responsible for the altered processing of socio-affective stimuli. To test this hypothesis, we recruited MDD patients with and without of maltreatment history to study the long-term consequences of childhood trauma and examined the impact of CM on brain activity using a facial emotion recognition fMRI task.\nMDD patients with childhood maltreatment (MDD\u00a0+\u00a0CM, n\u00a0=\u00a021), MDD patients without maltreatment (MDD, n\u00a0=\u00a019), and healthy controls (n\u00a0=\u00a021) matched for age, sex and intelligence quotient underwent fMRI while performing a block design facial emotion matching task with images portraying negative emotions (fear, anger and sadness). The history of maltreatment was assessed with the 28-item Childhood Trauma Questionnaire.\nBoth MDD and MDD\u00a0+\u00a0CM patients displayed impaired accuracy to recognize sad faces. Analysis of brain activity revealed that MDD\u00a0+\u00a0CM patients had significantly reduced negative BOLD signals in their right accumbens, subcallosal cortex, and anterior paracingulate gyrus compared to controls. Furthermore, MDD\u00a0+\u00a0CM patients had a significantly increased negative BOLD response in their right precentral and postcentral gyri compared to controls. We found little difference between MDD and MDD\u00a0+\u00a0CM patients, except that MDD\u00a0+\u00a0CM patients had reduced negative BOLD response in their anterior paracingulate gyrus relative to the MDD group.\nOur present data provide evidence that depressed patients with a history of maltreatment are impaired in facial emotion recognition and that they display altered functioning of key reward-related fronto-striatal circuits during a facial emotion matching task.", "Prior literature indicates that nontraditional attitudes are linked to higher intelligence. However, such attitudes in adolescence often accompany counter-normative, delinquent-type behaviors, which are themselves negatively linked with intelligence. This points to the possibility of suppression in the relationship between intelligence and nontraditional attitudes.\nWe analyzed a large community sample of 17\u00a0year olds (N\u00a0=\u00a03330) with data on intelligence, nontraditional attitudes, and a diverse collection of self- and teacher-reported counter-normative behaviors. Developmental questions for these relationships were examined through cross-sectional comparisons between the adolescents and their parents as well as longitudinal analysis of the adolescent sample across emerging adulthood.\nYouth who endorsed nontraditional attitudes had lower school grades, earlier age at first sex, heavier substance use, and were perceived as more oppositional by their teachers. Each of these problem behaviors was inversely related to intelligence. Accordingly, the positive correlation between nontraditional attitudes and intelligence was much weaker in adolescents as compared to their middle-aged parents. Longitudinal analyses revealed that the association between nontraditional attitudes and intelligence strengthens in early adulthood.\nAssociations between intelligence and sociopolitical attitudes can be obscured even by seemingly distal psychological characteristics.", "Nowadays, predictive medicine begins to become a reality thanks to Artificial Intelligence (AI) which allows, through the processing of huge amounts of data, to identify correlations not perceptible to the human brain. The application of AI in predictive diagnostics is increasingly pervasive; through the use and interpretation of data, the first signs of some diseases (i.e. tumours) can be detected to help physicians make more accurate diagnoses to reduce the errors and develop methods for individualized medical treatment. In this perspective, salivary gland tumours (SGTs) are rare cancers with variable malignancy representing less than 1% of all cancer diagnoses and about 5% of head and neck cancers. The clinical management of SGTs is complicated by a high rate of preclinical diagnostic errors. Today, fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) represents the primary diagnostic tool in the hands of clinicians. However, it provides information that about 25% of cases are dubious or inconclusive, complicating therapeutic choices. Thus, finding new tools supporting clinicians to make the right choices in doubtful cases is necessary. This research work presents and discusses a Deep Learning-based framework for automatic segmentation and classification of salivary gland tumours. Furthermore, we propose an explainable segmentation learning approach supporting the effectiveness of the proposed framework through a per-epoch learning process analysis and the attention map mechanism. The proposed framework was evaluated with a collected CT dataset of patients with salivary gland tumours. Experimental results show that our methodology achieves significant scores on both segmentation and classification tasks.", "Digital health solutions, applications of artificial intelligence (AI) and new technologies, such as cardiac magnetic resonance imaging and cardiac human genetics are currently being validated in cardiac healthcare pathways. They show promising approaches for improving existing healthcare structures in the future by strengthening the focus on predictive, preventive and personalized medicine. In addition, the accompanying use of digital health applications will become increasingly more important in the future healthcare, especially in patients with chronic diseases. In this article, the authors describe a\u00a0case of chronic heart failure (HF) as an example to provide an overview of how digitalized healthcare can be efficiently designed across sectors and disciplines in the future. Moreover, the importance of a\u00a0self-determined patient management for the treatment process itself is underlined. Since HF is frequently accompanied by various comorbidities during the course of the disease that are often recognized only after a\u00a0delay, the necessity for a\u00a0timely simultaneous and preventive treatment of multiple comorbidities in cardiovascular diseases is emphasized. Against this background the currently separately applied disease management programs (DMP) are critically questioned. The development of a\u00a0holistic DMP encompassing all indications for the treatment of chronic diseases\u00a0may pave the way to a\u00a0more efficient medical care system.\nAktuelle Anwendungen der k\u00fcnstlichen Intelligenz (KI), neue Technologien wie die kardiale Magnetresonanztomographie und die kardiale Humangenetik werden derzeit in den Versorgungspfaden der Kardiologie validiert und zeigen vielversprechende L\u00f6sungsans\u00e4tze, um bestehende Versorgungsstrukturen in Zukunft zu verbessern und die Ausrichtung einer pr\u00e4diktiven, pr\u00e4ventiven und personalisierten Medizin zu st\u00e4rken. Dar\u00fcber hinaus wird der begleitende Einsatz digitaler Gesundheitsanwendungen (DiGA) in der zuk\u00fcnftigen Gesundheitsversorgung insbesondere von chronisch erkrankten Patienten an Bedeutung gewinnen. Die Autoren geben im vorliegenden Beitrag am Beispiel der chronischen Herzinsuffizienz (HI) einen \u00dcberblick, wie eine digitalisierte Gesundheitsversorgung in Zukunft sektoren- und disziplin\u00fcbergreifend effizient gestaltet werden kann und welche entscheidende Rolle Patienten mit einem gest\u00e4rkten Selbstmanagement im Behandlungsprozess spielen. Da im Krankheitsverlauf einer HI h\u00e4ufig Komorbidit\u00e4ten auftreten und diese oftmals versp\u00e4tet identifiziert werden, wird dar\u00fcber hinaus die Notwendigkeit einer fr\u00fchzeitig simultanen und pr\u00e4ventiven Behandlung von Mehrfacherkrankungen bei kardiovaskul\u00e4ren Erkrankungen betont. Vor diesem Hintergrund werden die bisher isoliert voneinander aufgesetzten Disease-Management-Programme (DMP) kritisch hinterfragt. Die Entwicklung eines ganzheitlichen, indikations\u00fcbergreifenden DMP f\u00fcr chronische Erkrankungen k\u00f6nnte in diesem Zusammenhang richtungsweisend sein.", "With the continuous development of artificial intelligence, embedding object detection algorithms into autonomous underwater detectors for marine garbage cleanup has become an emerging application area. Considering the complexity of the marine environment and the low resolution of the images taken by underwater detectors, this paper proposes an improved algorithm based on Mask R-CNN, with the aim of achieving high accuracy marine garbage detection and instance segmentation. First, the idea of dilated convolution is introduced in the Feature Pyramid Network to enhance feature extraction ability for small objects. Secondly, the spatial-channel attention mechanism is used to make features learn adaptively. It can effectively focus attention on detection objects. Third, the re-scoring branch is added to improve the accuracy of instance segmentation by scoring the predicted masks based on the method of Generalized Intersection over Union. Finally, we train the proposed algorithm in this paper on the Transcan dataset, evaluating its effectiveness by various metrics and comparing it with existing algorithms. The experimental results show that compared to the baseline provided by the Transcan dataset, the algorithm in this paper improves the mAP indexes on the two tasks of garbage detection and instance segmentation by 9.6 and 5.0, respectively, which significantly improves the algorithm performance. Thus, it can be better applied in the marine environment and achieve high precision object detection and instance segmentation.", "This study aimed to prevent missing gastric cancer and point out low-quality images by developing a double-check support system (DCSS) for esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) still images using artificial intelligence.\nWe extracted 12,977 still EGD images from 855 cases with cancer [821 with early gastric carcinoma (EGC) and 34 malignant lymphoma (ML)] and developed a lesion detection system using 10,994 images. The remaining images were used as a test dataset. Additional validation was performed using a new dataset containing 50 EGC and 1,200 non-GC images by comparing the interpretation of ten endoscopists (five trainees and five experts). Furthermore, we developed another system to detect low-quality images, which are not suitable for diagnosis, using 2198 images.\nIn the validation of 1983 images from the 124 cancer cases, the DCSS diagnosed cancer with a sensitivity of 89.2%, positive predictive value (PPV) of 93.3%, and an accuracy of 83.3%. EGC was detected in 93.2% and ML in 92.5% of cases. Comparing with the endoscopists, sensitivity was significantly higher in the DCSS, and the average diagnostic time was significantly shorter using the DCSS than that by the trainees. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and accuracy in detecting low-quality images were 65.8%, 93.1%, 79.6%, and 85.2% for \"Blur\" and 57.8%, 91.7%, 82.2%, and 78.1% for \"Mucus adhesion,\" respectively.\nThe DCSS showed excellent capability in detecting lesions and pointing out low-quality images.", "Efficient and accurate methods of analysis are needed for the huge amount of biological data that have accumulated in various research fields, including genomics, phenomics, and genetics. Artificial intelligence (AI)-based analysis is one promising method to manipulate biological data. To this end, various algorithms have been developed and applied in fields such as disease diagnosis, species classification, and object prediction. In the field of phenomics, classification of accessions and variants is important for basic science and industrial applications. To construct AI-based classification models, three types of phenotypic image data were generated from 156 Brassica rapa core collections, and classification analyses were carried out using four different convolutional neural network architectures. The results of lateral view data showed higher accuracy compared with top view data. Furthermore, the relatively low accuracy of ResNet50 architecture suggested that definition and estimation of similarity index of phenotypic data were required before the selection of deep learning architectures.", "Background: Concussion subtypes are typically organized into commonly affected symptom areas or a combination of affected systems, an approach that may be flawed by bias in conceptualization or the inherent limitations of interdisciplinary expertise. Objective: The purpose of this study was to determine whether a bottom-up, unsupervised, machine learning approach, could more accurately support concussion subtyping. Methods: Initial patient intake data as well as objective outcome measures including, the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS), Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI), Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS), and Immediate Post-Concussion Assessment and Cognitive Testing Tool (ImPACT) were retrospectively extracted from the Advance Concussion Clinic's database. A correlation matrix and principal component analysis (PCA) were used to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset. Sklearn's agglomerative clustering algorithm was then applied, and the optimal number of clusters within the patient database were generated. Between-group comparisons among the formed clusters were performed using a Mann-Whitney U test. Results: Two hundred seventy-five patients within the clinics database were analyzed. Five distinct clusters emerged from the data when maximizing the Silhouette score (0.36) and minimizing the Davies-Bouldin score (0.83). Concussion subtypes derived demonstrated clinically distinct profiles, with statistically significant differences (p < 0.05) between all five clusters. Conclusion: This machine learning approach enabled the identification and characterization of five distinct concussion subtypes, which were best understood according to levels of complexity, ranging from Extremely Complex to Minimally Complex. Understanding concussion in terms of Complexity with the utilization of artificial intelligence, could provide a more accurate concussion classification or subtype approach; one that better reflects the true heterogeneity and complex system disruptions associated with mild traumatic brain injury.", "The hormone osteocalcin influenced neurodevelopment and cognition in mice models; this human study explored potential associations between total serum levels in human infants and neurodevelopment at 4\u00a0years of age.\nThe data were based on two Swedish birth cohorts from 2008 to 2009. We followed 158\u00a0healthy full-term vaginal births (51% girls) by measuring serum osteocalcin in cord blood and at 4, 12 and 36\u00a0months. The values were compared with neurodevelopment tests at 4\u00a0years of age.\nThere was an association between osteocalcin at 4\u00a0months and later full-scale intelligence quotient (IQ; r2 0.031, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Children with osteocalcin levels in the highest quartile scored 5.6 (95% confidence interval [1.3, 9.9]) points higher than those in the lowest quartile, with mean scores of 118.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08.8 and 113.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09.2 (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). They also scored higher on gross motor skills (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) and showed greater ability during the drawing trail test (p\u00a0<\u00a00.005). Cord levels of osteocalcin were negatively associated with processing speed and fine motor development at 4\u00a0years, but levels at 12 and 36\u00a0months were not associated with later neurodevelopment.\nOsteocalcin levels in infancy appeared to be associated with later IQ and motor development, but more research is needed.", "Objectives: COVID-19 is highly infectious and has been widely spread worldwide, with more than 159 million confirmed cases and more than 3 million deaths as of May 11, 2021. It has become a serious public health event threatening people's lives and safety. Due to the rapid transmission and long incubation period, shortage of medical resources would easily occur in the short term of discovering disease cases. Therefore, we aimed to construct an artificial intelligent framework to rapidly distinguish patients with COVID-19 from common pneumonia and non-pneumonia populations based on computed tomography (CT) images. Furthermore, we explored artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to integrate CT features and laboratory findings on admission to predict the clinical classification of COVID-19. This will ease the burden of doctors in this emergency period and aid them to perform timely and appropriate treatment on patients. Methods: We collected all CT images and clinical data of novel coronavirus pneumonia cases in Inner Mongolia, including domestic cases and those imported from abroad; then, three models based on transfer learning to distinguish COVID-19 from other pneumonia and non-pneumonia population were developed. In addition, CT features and laboratory findings on admission were combined to predict clinical types of COVID-19 using AI algorithms. Lastly, Spearman's correlation test was applied to study correlations of CT characteristics and laboratory findings. Results: Among three models to distinguish COVID-19 based on CT, vgg19 showed excellent diagnostic performance, with area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve at 95%. Together with laboratory findings, we were able to predict clinical types of COVID-19 with AUC of the ROC curve at 90%. Furthermore, biochemical markers, such as C-reactive protein (CRP), LYM, and lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) were identified and correlated with CT features. Conclusion: We developed an AI model to identify patients who were positive for COVID-19 according to the results of the first CT examination after admission and predict the progression combined with laboratory findings. In addition, we obtained important clinical characteristics that correlated with the CT image features. Together, our AI system could rapidly diagnose COVID-19 and predict clinical types to assist clinicians perform appropriate clinical management.", "Biological aging is revealed by physical measures, e.g., DNA probes or brain scans. In contrast, individual differences in mental function are explained by psychological constructs, e.g., intelligence or neuroticism. These constructs are typically assessed by tailored neuropsychological tests that build on expert judgement and require careful interpretation. Could machine learning on large samples from the general population be used to build proxy measures of these constructs that do not require human intervention?\nHere, we built proxy measures by applying machine learning on multimodal MR images and rich sociodemographic information from the largest biomedical cohort to date: the UK Biobank. Objective model comparisons revealed that all proxies captured the target constructs and were as useful, and sometimes more useful, than the original measures for characterizing real-world health behavior (sleep, exercise, tobacco, alcohol consumption). We observed this complementarity of proxy measures and original measures at capturing multiple health-related constructs when modeling from, both, brain signals and sociodemographic data.\nPopulation modeling with machine learning can derive measures of mental health from heterogeneous inputs including brain signals and questionnaire data. This may complement or even substitute for psychometric assessments in clinical populations.", "To compare an artificial intelligence (AI)-based prototype and subjective grading for predicting disease severity in patients with emphysema.\nOur IRB approved HIPAA-compliant study included 113 adults (71\u00b18 years; 47 females, 66 males) who had both non-contrast chest CT and pulmonary function tests performed within a span of 2 months. The disease severity was classified based on the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1 as % of predicted) into mild, moderate, and severe. 2 thoracic radiologists (RA), blinded to the clinical and AI results, graded severity of emphysema on a 5-point scale suggested by the Fleischner Society for each lobe. The whole lung scores were derived from the summation of lobar scores. Thin-section CT images were processed with the AI-Rad Companion Chest prototype (Siemens Healthineers) to quantify low attenuation areas (LAA < - 950 HU) in whole lung and each lobe separately. Bronchial abnormality was assessed by both radiologists and a fully automated software (Philips Healthcare).\nBoth AI (AUC of 0.77; 95% CI: 0.68 - 0.85) and RA (AUC: 0.76, 95% CI: 0.65 - 0.84) emphysema quantification could differentiate mild, moderate, and severe disease based on FEV1. There was a strong positive correlation between AI and RA (r\u00a0=\u00a00.72 - 0.80; p <0.001). The combination of emphysema and bronchial abnormality quantification from radiologists' and AI assessment could differentiate between different severities with AUC of 0.80 - 0.82 and 0.87, respectively.\nThe assessed AI-prototypes can predict the disease severity in patients with emphysema with the same predictive value as the radiologists.", "We assessed the reliability of cognitive testing for children and adolescents ages 8 to 19 years of age with narcolepsy or subjective daytime sleepiness compared to healthy controls. Forty-six participants took part in the study (n\u2009=\u200918 narcolepsy type 1, n\u2009=\u20096 subjective daytime sleepiness, and n\u2009=\u200922 healthy controls). Participants completed verbal (vocabulary testing) and non-verbal intelligence quotient (IQ) tasks (block design, matrix reasoning) from the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence- Second Edition (WASI-II) in-person or remotely through a HIPAA compliant telehealth platform with conditions counterbalanced. We found that vocabulary T-scores showed good reliability with intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.76 (95% CI: 0.64, 0.85) between remote and in-person testing conditions. Matrix Reasoning T-scores showed moderate reliability (ICC 0.69, 95% CI: 0.68, 0.90) and Block Design T-scores was poor between testing conditions. Overall, the results of this pilot study support the feasibility and reliability of verbal and non-verbal IQ scores collected by telehealth.", "NASA planetary protection (PP) requires an assessment of the biological contamination of the potential microbial burden on spacecraft destined to explore planetary bodies that may harbor signs of life, like Mars and Europa. To help meet these goals, the performance of multiple metagenomic pipelines were compared and assessed for their ability to detect microbial diversity of a low-biomass clean room environment used to build spacecraft destined to these planetary bodies. Four vendors were chosen to implement their own metagenomic analysis pipeline on the shotgun sequences retrieved from environmental surfaces in the relevant environments at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. None of the vendors showed the same microbial profile patterns when analyzing same raw dataset since each vendor used different pipelines, which begs the question of the validity of a single pipeline to be recommended for future NASA missions. All four vendors detected species of interest, including spore-forming and extremotolerant bacteria, that have the potential to hitch-hike on spacecraft and contaminate the planetary bodies explored. Some vendors demonstrated through functional analysis of the metagenomes that the molecular mechanisms for spore-formation and extremotolerance were represented in the data. However, relative abundances of these microorganisms varied drastically between vendor analyses, questioning the ability of these pipelines to quantify the number of PP-relevant microorganisms on a spacecraft surface. Metagenomics offers tantalizing access to the genetic and functional potential of a microbial community that may offer NASA a viable method for microbial burden assays for planetary protection purposes. However, future development of technologies such as streamlining the processing of shotgun metagenome sequence data, long read sequencing, and all-inclusive larger curated and annotated microbial genome databases will be required to validate and translate relative abundances into an actionable assessment of PP-related microbes of interest. Additionally, the future development of machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques could help enhance the quality of these metagenomic analyses by providing more accurate identification of the genetic and functional potential of a microbial community.", "Depression prevalence is high, impacting approximately 20% of Americans during their lifetime, and on the rise due to stress and loss associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the high prevalence of depression, unacceptable treatment access disparities persist. When depression goes untreated, it leads to substantial negative impacts in multiple life domains. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), the gold-standard psychosocial treatment for depression, remains largely unavailable to individuals living with depression, particularly individuals who are members of underrepresented groups in our society. Digital mental health interventions (DMHI) have led to important advances in extending the reach of CBT for depression; however, they are underutilized and treatment engagement remains low. We sought to address some of the current gaps in DMHI by developing an online platform for delivering CBT for depression that is entertaining, simple and straightforward, and tailorable. First, this article introduces our online platform, Entertain Me Well (EMW) and its key innovations, including the use of an engaging, character-driven storyline presented as \"episodes\" within each session, as well as customizable content that allows for tailoring of text, images, and examples to create content most relevant to the target client population, context, or setting. Next, we describe two EMW depression treatment programs that have been tailored: one for delivery in the rural church setting, called Raising Our Spirits Together, and one tailored for delivery in dialysis centers, called Doing Better on Dialysis. Finally, we discuss future directions for the EMW platform, including the ability to create programs for other common mental health and health conditions, the development of additional character-driven storylines with greater treatment personalization, translation of content in multiple languages, and the use of additional technological innovation, such as artificial intelligence like natural language processing, to enhance platform interactivity.", "(1) Melanoma is the most aggressive dermatologic malignancy, with an estimated 106,110 new cases to be diagnosed in 2021. The annual incidence rates continue to climb, which underscores the critical importance of improving the methods to prevent this disease. The interventions to assist with melanoma prevention vary and typically include measures such as UV avoidance and the use of protective clothing, sunscreen, and other chemopreventive agents. However, the evidence is mixed surrounding the use of these and other interventions. This review discusses the heritable etiologies underlying melanoma development before delving into the data surrounding the preventive methods highlighted above. (2) A comprehensive literature review was performed to identify the clinical trials, observational studies, and meta-analyses pertinent to melanoma prevention and incidence. Online resources were queried to identify epidemiologic and clinical trial information. (3) Evidence exists to support population-wide screening programs, the proper use of sunscreen, and community-targeted measures in the prevention of melanoma. Clinical evidence for the majority of the proposed preventive chemotherapeutics is presently minimal but continues to evolve. (4) Further study of these chemotherapeutics, as well as improvement of techniques in artificial intelligence and imaging techniques for melanoma screening, is warranted for continued improvement of melanoma prevention.", "Radioactive iodine-125 (I-125) is the most widely used radioactive sealed source for interstitial permanent brachytherapy (BT). BT has the exceptional ability to deliver extremely high doses that external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) could never achieve within treated lesions, with the added benefit that doses drop off rapidly outside the target lesion by minimizing the exposure of uninvolved surrounding normal tissue. Spurred by multiple biological and technological advances, BT application has experienced substantial alteration over the past few decades. The procedure of I-125 radioactive seed implantation evolved from ultrasound guidance to computed tomography guidance. Compellingly, the creative introduction of 3D-printed individual templates, BT treatment planning systems, and artificial intelligence navigator systems remarkably increased the accuracy of I-125 BT and individualized I-125 ablative radiotherapy. Of note, utilizing I-125 to treat carcinoma in hollow cavity organs was enabled by the utility of self-expandable metal stents (SEMSs). Initially, I-125 BT was only used in the treatment of rare tumors. However, an increasing number of clinical trials upheld the efficacy and safety of I-125 BT in almost all tumors. Therefore, this study aims to summarize the recent advances of I-125 BT in cancer therapy, which cover experimental research to clinical investigations, including the development of novel techniques. This review also raises unanswered questions that may prompt future clinical trials and experimental work.", "The aim of this study was to determine whether left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and right ventricular ejection fraction (RVEF) and left ventricular mass (LVM) measurements made using 3 fully automated deep learning (DL) algorithms are accurate and interchangeable and can be used to classify ventricular function and risk-stratify patients as accurately as an expert.\nArtificial intelligence is increasingly used to assess cardiac function and LVM from cardiac magnetic resonance images.\nTwo hundred patients were identified from a registry of individuals who underwent vasodilator stress cardiac magnetic resonance. LVEF, LVM, and RVEF were determined using 3 fully automated commercial DL algorithms and by a clinical expert (CLIN) using conventional methodology. Additionally, LVEF values were classified according to clinically important ranges:\u00a0<35%, 35% to 50%, and\u00a0\u226550%. Both ejection fraction values and classifications made by the DL ejection fraction approaches were compared against CLIN ejection fraction reference. Receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis was performed to evaluate the ability of CLIN and each of the DL classifications to predict major adverse cardiovascular events.\nExcellent correlations were seen for each DL-LVEF compared with CLIN-LVEF (r\u00a0=\u00a00.83-0.93). Good correlations were present between DL-LVM and CLIN-LVM (r\u00a0=\u00a00.75-0.85). Modest correlations were observed between DL-RVEF and CLIN-RVEF (r\u00a0=\u00a00.59-0.68). A >10% error between CLIN and DL ejection fraction was present in 5% to 18% of cases for the left ventricle and 23% to 43% for the right ventricle. LVEF classification agreed with CLIN-LVEF classification in 86%, 80%, and 85% cases for the 3 DL-LVEF approaches. There were no differences among the 4 approaches in associations with major adverse cardiovascular events for LVEF, LVM, and RVEF.\nThis study revealed good agreement between automated and expert-derived LVEF and similarly strong associations with outcomes, compared with an expert. However, the ability of these automated measurements to accurately classify left ventricular function for treatment decision remains limited. DL-LVM showed good agreement with CLIN-LVM. DL-RVEF approaches need further refinements.", "To explore an artificial intelligence approach based on gradient-boosted decision trees for prediction of all-cause mortality at an intensive care unit, comparing its performance to a recent logistic regression system in the literature, and a logistic regression model built on the same platform.\nA gradient-boosted decision trees model and a logistic regression model were trained and tested with the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care database. The 1-hour resolution physiological measurements of adult patients, collected during 5 hours in the intensive care unit, consisted of eight routine clinical parameters. The study addressed how the models learn to categorize patients to predict intensive care unit mortality or survival within 12 hours. The performance was evaluated with accuracy statistics and the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve.\nThe gradient-boosted trees yielded an area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve of 0.89, compared to 0.806 for the logistic regression. The accuracy was 0.814 for the gradient-boosted trees, compared to 0.782 for the logistic regression. The diagnostic odds ratio was 17.823 for the gradient-boosted trees, compared to 9.254 for the logistic regression. The Cohen's kappa, F-measure, Matthews correlation coefficient, and markedness were higher for the gradient-boosted trees.\nThe discriminatory power of the gradient-boosted trees was excellent. The gradient-boosted trees outperformed the logistic regression regarding intensive care unit mortality prediction.

Survey questions covered attitudes toward AI in general, future impacts and suggested areas for development specifically within paediatric imaging.\nTwo hundred and forty responses were collected with the majority being from radiologists (159/240, 66.3%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 59.8-72.2%) or allied health care professionals (72/240, 31.3%; 95% CI 25.4-37.5%). Respondents agreed that AI could potentially alert radiologists to imaging abnormalities (148/240, 61.7%; 95% CI 55.2-67.9%) but preferred that results were checked by a human (200/240, 83.3%; 95% CI 78.0-87.8%). The majority did not believe jobs in paediatric radiology would be replaced by AI (205/240, 85.4%; 95% CI 80.3-89.6%) and that the development of AI tools should focus on improved diagnostic accuracy (77/240, 32.1%; 95% CI 26.2-38.4%), workflow efficiencies (60/240, 25.0%; 95% CI 19.7-30.9%) and patient safety (54/240, 22.5%; 95% CI 17.4-28.3%). The majority of European Society of Paediatric Radiology (ESPR) members (67/81, 82.7%; 95% CI 72.7-90.2%) welcomed the idea of a dedicated paediatric radiology AI task force with emphasis on educational events and anonymised dataset curation.\nImaging health care professionals working with children had a positive outlook regarding the use of AI in paediatric radiology, and did not feel their jobs were threatened. Future AI tools would be most beneficial for easily automated tasks and most practitioners welcomed the opportunity for further AI educational activities.", "Machine learning is an increasingly key influence on the financial services industry. In this paper, we review the roles and impact of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) on the UK financial services industry. We survey the current AI/ML landscape in the UK. ML has had a considerable impact in the areas of fraud and compliance, credit scoring, financial distress prediction, robo-advising and algorithmic trading. We examine these applications using UK examples. We also review the importance of regulation and governance in ML applications to financial services. Finally, we assess the performance of ML during the Covid-19 pandemic and conclude with directions for future research.", "Over the past two decades, considerable efforts have been made to develop non-invasive methods for determining tumor grade or surrogates for predicting the biological behavior, aiding early treatment decisions, and providing prognostic information. The development of new imaging tools, such as diffusion-weighted imaging, diffusion kurtosis imaging, perfusion imaging, and magnetic resonance spectroscopy have provided leverage in the diagnosis of soft tissue sarcomas. Artificial intelligence is a new technology used to study and simulate human thinking and abilities, which can extract and analyze advanced and quantitative image features from medical images with high throughput for an in-depth characterization of the spatial heterogeneity of tumor tissues. This article reviews the current imaging modalities used to predict the histopathological grade of soft tissue sarcomas and highlights the advantages and limitations of each modality. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 5 TECHNICAL EFFICACY: Stage 2.", "In recent years, individual and collective human intelligence, defined as the knowledge, skills, reasoning and intuition of individuals and groups, have been used in combination with computer algorithms to solve complex scientific problems. Such approach was successfully used in different research fields such as: structural biology, comparative genomics, macromolecular crystallography and RNA design. Herein we describe an attempt to use a similar approach in small-molecule drug discovery, specifically to drive search strategies of de novo drug design. This is assessed with a case study that consists of a series of public experiments in which participants had to explore the huge chemical space in silico to find predefined compounds by designing molecules and analyzing the score associate with them. Such a process may be seen as an instantaneous surrogate of the classical design-make-test cycles carried out by medicinal chemists during the drug discovery hit to lead phase but not hindered by long synthesis and testing times. We present first findings on (1) assessing human intelligence in chemical space exploration, (2) comparing individual and collective human intelligence performance in this task and (3) contrasting some human and artificial intelligence achievements in de novo drug design.", "The public specialty ophthalmic clinics in Hong Kong, under the Hospital Authority, receive tens of thousands of referrals each year. Triaging these referrals incurs a significant workload for practitioners and the other clinical duties. It is well-established that Hong Kong is currently facing a shortage of healthcare workers. Thus a more efficient system in triaging will\u00a0not only free up resources for better use but also improve the satisfaction of both practitioners and patients. Machine learning (ML) has been shown to improve the efficiency of various medical workflows, including triaging, by both reducing the workload and increasing accuracy in some cases. Despite a myriad of studies on medical artificial intelligence, there is no specific framework for a triaging algorithm in ophthalmology clinics. This study proposes a general framework for developing, deploying and evaluating an ML-based triaging algorithm in a clinical setting. Through literature review, this study identifies good practices in various facets of developing such a network and protocols for maintenance and evaluation of the impact concerning clinical utility and external validity out of the laboratory. We hope this framework, albeit not exhaustive, can act as a foundation to accelerate future pilot studies and deployments.", "This research was developed to investigate the effect of artificial intelligence neural network-based magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) image segmentation on the neurological function of patients with acute cerebral infarction treated with butylphthalide combined with edaravone. Eighty patients with acute cerebral infarction were selected as the research subjects, and the MRI images of patients with acute cerebral infarction were segmented by convolutional neural networks (CNN) upgraded algorithm model. MRI images of patients before and after treatment of butylphthalide combined with edaravone were compared to comprehensively evaluate the efficacy of this treatment. The results showed that compared with the traditional CNN algorithm, the running time of the CNN upgraded algorithm adopted in this study was significantly shorter, and the Loss value was lower than that of the traditional CNN model. Upgraded CNN model can realize accurate segmentation of cerebral infarction lesions in MRI images of patients. In addition, the degree of cerebral infarction and the degree of arterial stenosis were significantly improved after treatment with butylphthalide and edaravone. Compared with that before treatment, the number of patients with severe cerebral infarction or even vascular stenosis decreased significantly (P < 0.05), and gradually changed to mild vascular stenosis, and the neurological dysfunction of patients was also significantly improved. In short, MRI image segmentation based on artificial intelligence neural network can well-evaluate the efficacy and neurological impairment of butylphthalide combined with edaravone in the treatment of acute cerebral infarction, and it was worthy of promotion in clinical evaluation of the treatment effect of acute cerebral infarction.", "Traditional approaches to lower face contouring involve ostectomy of the mandibular angle or body. More recently, nonsurgical techniques have gained popularity, including neurotoxin injection to the masseter muscle. This study aims to evaluate layperson perceptions of patient attractiveness and personality traits following lower face contouring using either surgical or nonsurgical treatment.\nIn this survey study distributed via Amazon's Mechanical Turk, respondents viewed a series of 14 patient images obtained in clinic before and after surgical or nonsurgical jawline slimming, or without any facial aesthetic procedure. Respondents rated changes in attractiveness and personality trait scores between the before and after image (score: -50 to 50, with 50 representing the greatest posttreatment increase and 0 representing no change). We used descriptive statistics and multivariable regression to determine differences in respondent ratings between patient images.\nA total of 415 respondents (mean age 38\u200ayears, 50.6% female) successfully completed the survey. Compared to patients who underwent nonsurgical treatment, those who received surgery had significantly greater increases in perceived attractiveness (P\u200a<\u200a0.001), femininity (P\u200a<\u200a0.001), friendliness (P\u200a<\u200a0.001), intelligence (P\u200a<\u200a0.001), trustworthiness (P\u200a<\u200a0.001), financial wealthiness (P\u200a<\u200a0.001), dominance (P\u200a<\u200a0.01), and self-esteem (P\u200a<\u200a0.001). Gonial angles increased and jaw widths decreased following both surgical and nonsurgical intervention, with no statistically significant difference between treatment groups.\nFrom the layperson perspective, surgical compared to nonsurgical jawline contouring offers greater improvements in perceptions of attractiveness and favorable personality traits.", "Observing chromosomes is a time-consuming and labor-intensive process, and chromosomes have been analyzed manually for many years. In the last decade, automated acquisition systems for microscopic images have advanced dramatically due to advances in their controlling computer systems, and nowadays, it is possible to automatically acquire sets of tiling-images consisting of large number, more than 1000, of images from large areas of specimens. However, there has been no simple and inexpensive system to efficiently select images containing mitotic cells among these images. In this paper, a classification system of chromosomal images by deep learning artificial intelligence (AI) that can be easily handled by non-data scientists was applied. With this system, models suitable for our own samples could be easily built on a Macintosh computer with Create ML. As examples, models constructed by learning using chromosome images derived from various plant species were able to classify images containing mitotic cells among samples from plant species not used for learning in addition to samples from the species used. The system also worked for cells in tissue sections and tetrads. Since this system is inexpensive and can be easily trained via deep learning using scientists' own samples, it can be used not only for chromosomal image analysis but also for analysis of other biology-related images.", "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder defined as persistent difficulty in maturing the socialization process. Health professionals have used traditional methods in the therapies performed on patients with the aim of improving the expression of emotions by patients. However, they have not been sufficient to detect the different emotions expressed in the face of people according to different sensations. Therefore, different artificial intelligence techniques have been applied to improve the results obtained in these therapies. In this article, we propose the construction of an intelligent mirror to recognize five basic emotions: angry, scared, sad, happy and neutral. This mirror uses convolutional neural networks to analyze the images that are captured by a camera and compare it with the one that the patient should perform, thus supporting the therapies performed by health professionals in children with ASD. The proposal presents the platform and computer architecture, as well as the evaluation by specialists under the technology acceptance model.", "The research presented in this manuscript proposes a novel Harris Hawks optimization algorithm with practical application for evolving convolutional neural network architecture to classify various grades of brain tumor using magnetic resonance imaging. The proposed improved Harris Hawks optimization method, which belongs to the group of swarm intelligence metaheuristics, further improves the exploration and exploitation abilities of the basic algorithm by incorporating a chaotic population initialization and local search, along with a replacement strategy based on the quasi-reflection-based learning procedure. The proposed method was first evaluated on 10 recent CEC2019 benchmarks and the achieved results are compared with the ones generated by the basic algorithm, as well as with results of other state-of-the-art approaches that were tested under the same experimental conditions. In subsequent empirical research, the proposed method was adapted and applied for a practical challenge of convolutional neural network design. The evolved network structures were validated against two datasets that contain images of a healthy brain and brain with tumors. The first dataset comprises well-known IXI and cancer imagining archive images, while the second dataset consists of axial T1-weighted brain tumor images, as proposed in one recently published study in the Q1 journal. After performing data augmentation, the first dataset encompasses 8.000 healthy and 8.000 brain tumor images with grades I, II, III, and IV and the second dataset includes 4.908 images with Glioma, Meningioma, and Pituitary, with 1.636 images belonging to each tumor class. The swarm intelligence-driven convolutional neural network approach was evaluated and compared to other, similar methods and achieved a superior performance. The obtained accuracy was over 95% in all conducted experiments. Based on the established results, it is reasonable to conclude that the proposed approach could be used to develop networks that can assist doctors in diagnostics and help in the early detection of brain tumors.", "With good flexibility and biocompatibility, hydrogel-based sensors have been widely used in human motion detection, artificial intelligence, human-machine interface, and other fields. Previous research on hydrogel-based sensors has focused on improving the mechanical properties and signal transmission sensitivity. With the development of human smart devices, there is an increasing demand for hydrogel sensor comfort and more application functions, such as ultrathin structures and recognition functions for contact surfaces, which are realized with higher requirements for the thickness, flexibility, friction resistance, and biocompatibility of hydrogels. Inspired by the ultrathin and flexible characteristics of human organ biofilms, we constructed conductive hydrogel films by using the flim-casting and glycerol-H2O secondary hydration methods. This ultrathin structure enables the hydrogel films to have a high elongation at break of 523.3%, a stress of 3.5 MPa, and a good friction resistance. Combined with the excellent sensing properties (gauge factor = 2.1 and a response time of 200 ms), the hydrogel film-based sensor can not only record human motion signals but also recognize the surface texture and roughness of objects, such as glass, brushes, wood, and sandpaper with mesh sizes of 80, 50, and 24, accurately. In addition, this hydrogel film has a series of excellent properties such as UV shielding, antiswelling ability, and good biocompatibility. This research provides a novel way for the development of emerging soft-material smart devices, such as hydrogel-based electronic skin and soft robots.", "The performance of deep-learning image recognition models is below par when applied to images with Fitzpatrick classification skin types 4 and 5.\nThe objective of this research was to assess whether image recognition models perform differently when differentiating between dermatological diseases in individuals with darker skin color (Fitzpatrick skin types 4 and 5) than when differentiating between the same dermatological diseases in Caucasians (Fitzpatrick skin types 1, 2, and 3) when both models are trained on the same number of images.\nTwo image recognition models were trained, validated, and tested. The goal of each model was to differentiate between melanoma and basal cell carcinoma. Open-source images of melanoma and basal cell carcinoma were acquired from the Hellenic Dermatological Atlas, the Dermatology Atlas, the Interactive Dermatology Atlas, and DermNet NZ.\nThe image recognition models trained and validated on images with light skin color had higher sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and F1 score than the image recognition models trained and validated on images of skin of color for differentiation between melanoma and basal cell carcinoma.\nA higher number of images of dermatological diseases in individuals with darker skin color than images of dermatological diseases in individuals with light skin color would need to be gathered for artificial intelligence models to perform equally well.", "Objective: Emotional intelligence describes how well an individual understands and manages his or her emotions. Parenting styles and early life events have an important bearing on emotional intelligence. The objective of this study was to assess the impact of adverse childhood events and perception toward parents on the various domains of emotional intelligence among medical interns. Methods: This cross-sectional observational study was conducted among medical interns in an eastern Indian teaching hospital from August 2020 to September 2020. Emotional intelligence was assessed using the Quick Emotional Intelligence Self-Assessment in terms of emotional awareness, emotional management, social emotional management, and relationship management. Adverse childhood experiences were assessed using the Adverse Childhood Experiences Questionnaire. Perception toward parents for all participants was assessed using the Perceptions of Parents Scale, which measured their mother's involvement, autonomy and support, and warmth and their father's involvement, autonomy and support, and warmth. Results: Of the 84 participants, 66.66% (n\u2009=\u200956) reported at least 1 adverse childhood experience. There was a significant negative correlation of adverse childhood experiences with emotional management (r\u2009=\u2009-0.542, n\u2009=\u200984, P\u2009=\u2009.00) and relationship management (r\u2009=\u2009-0.219, n\u2009=\u200984, P\u2009=\u2009.45). Emotional management showed a positive correlation with mother's involvement (r\u2009=\u20090.269, P\u2009=\u2009.013), autonomy and support (r\u2009=\u20090.34, P\u2009=\u2009.02), and warmth (r\u2009=\u20090.264, P\u2009=\u2009.015) and father's involvement (r\u2009=\u20090.336, P\u2009=\u2009.002), autonomy and support (r\u2009=\u20090.334, P\u2009=\u2009.002), and warmth (r\u2009=\u20090.340, P\u2009=\u2009.002). Relationship management showed a positive correlation with mother's involvement (r\u2009=\u20090.302, P\u2009=\u2009.005), autonomy and support (r\u2009=\u20090.272, P\u2009=\u2009.012), and warmth (r\u2009=\u20090.272, P\u2009=\u2009.012). Social emotional management showed a positive correlation with father's involvement (r\u2009=\u20090.294, P\u2009=\u2009.007), autonomy and support (r\u2009=\u20090.297, P\u2009=\u2009.006), and warmth (r\u2009=\u20090.297, P\u2009=\u2009.01). Conclusion: Experiencing adverse childhood events lowers emotional intelligence. Higher parental involvement, warmth, and autonomy and support promote better social emotional awareness, as well as emotional and relationship management.", "Artificial intelligence (AI), together with robotics, sensors, sensor networks, internet of things (IoT) and machine/deep learning modeling, has reached the forefront towards the goal of increased efficiency in a multitude of application and purpose [...].", "Acute intestinal ischemia is a life-threatening condition. The current gold standard, with evaluation based on visual and tactile sensation, has low specificity. In this study, we explore the feasibility of using machine learning models on images of the intestine, to assess small intestinal viability. A digital microscope was used to acquire images of the jejunum in 10 pigs. Ischemic segments were created by local clamping (approximately 30 cm in width) of small arteries and veins in the mesentery and reperfusion was initiated by releasing the clamps. A series of images were acquired once an hour on the surface of each of the segments. The convolutional neural network (CNN) has previously been used to classify medical images, while knowledge is lacking whether CNNs have potential to classify ischemia-reperfusion injury on the small intestine. We compared how different deep learning models perform for this task. Moreover, the Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) method within explainable artificial intelligence (AI) was used to identify features that the model utilizes as important in classification of different ischemic injury degrees. To be able to assess to what extent we can trust our deep learning model decisions is critical in a clinical setting. A probabilistic model Bayesian CNN was implemented to estimate the model uncertainty which provides a confidence measure of our model decisions.", "We investigated the associations between hearing aids (HA) and the maintenance of cognitive function among community-dwelling older adults with moderate hearing loss. A total of 407 participants aged 60 years or older with moderate hearing loss were recruited from the National Institute for Longevity Sciences, Longitudinal Study for Aging (NILS-LSA). Moderate hearing loss was defined as a pure-tone average of 40-69 dB at 500, 1000, 2000, and 4000 Hz of the better ear, according to the definition proposed by the Japan Audiological Society. Cognitive function was evaluated using the four subtests of the Japanese version of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised Short Forms (WAIS-R-SF): Information, Similarities, Picture completion, and Digit Symbol Substitution (DSST). A longitudinal analysis of 1192 observations with a mean follow-up period of 4.5 \u00b1 3.9 years was performed. The HA use rate at any time during the follow-up period was 31.4%, and HA users were significantly younger (t-test, p = 0.001), had worse hearing (p < .0001) and higher education (p = 0.001), participated more frequently in the survey (p < .0001), and were less depressed (\u03c72 test, p = 0.003) than the older adults not using HA. General linear mixed models consisted of the fixed effects of HA use, follow-up time, and an HA use \u00d7 time interaction term adjusted for age and pure-tone average thresholds at baseline, sex, education, and other possible confounders. HA use showed significant main effects on the scores for Picture completion and DSST after adjustment; scores were better in the HA use group than in the no HA use group. The HA use \u00d7 time interaction was significant for the Information score (p = 0.040). The model-predicted 12-year slope with centralizing age indicated that the no HA use group showed greater decline over time on Information scores than did HA use group. The slopes did not differ between HA users and non-users for the Similarities, Picture completion and DSST. In conclusion, HA use may have a protective effect on the decline in general knowledge in older adults with moderate hearing loss.", "(1) Background: The rapid pace of digital development in everyday life is also reflected in dentistry, including the emergence of the first systems based on artificial intelligence (AI). This systematic review focused on the recent scientific literature and provides an overview of the application of AI in the dental discipline of prosthodontics. (2) Method: According to a modified PICO-strategy, an electronic (MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL) and manual search up to 30 June 2021 was carried out for the literature published in the last five years reporting the use of AI in the field of prosthodontics. (3) Results: 560 titles were screened, of which 30 abstracts and 16 full texts were selected for further review. Seven studies met the inclusion criteria and were analyzed. Most of the identified studies reported the training and application of an AI system (n = 6) or explored the function of an intrinsic AI system in a CAD software (n = 1). (4) Conclusions: While the number of included studies reporting the use of AI was relatively low, the summary of the obtained findings by the included studies represents the latest AI developments in prosthodontics demonstrating its application for automated diagnostics, as a predictive measure, and as a classification or identification tool. In the future, AI technologies will likely be used for collecting, processing, and organizing patient-related datasets to provide patient-centered, individualized dental treatment.", "We aimed at developing a pilot version of an app (Rosa) that can perform digital conversations with breast or ovarian cancer patients about genetic BRCA testing, using chatbot technology, to identify best practices for future patient-focused chatbots.\nWe chose a commercial chatbot platform and participatory methodology with a team of patient representatives, IT engineers, genetic counselors and clinical geneticists, within a nationwide collaboration. An iterative approach ensured extensive user and formal usability testing during the development process.\nThe development phase lasted for two years until the pilot version was completed in December 2019. The iteration steps disclosed major challenges in the artificial intelligence (AI)-based matching of user provided questions with predefined information in the database, leading initially to high level of fallback answers. We therefore developed strategies to reduce potential language ambiguities (e.g. BRCA1 vs BRCA2) and overcome dialogue confusion. The first prototype contained a database with 500 predefined questions and 67 corresponding predefined answers, while the final version included 2257 predefined questions and 144 predefined answers. Despite the limited AI functionality of the chatbot, the testing revealed that the users liked the layout and found the chatbot trustworthy and reader friendly.\nBuilding a health chatbot is challenging, expensive and time consuming with today's technology. The users had a positive attitude to the chatbot, and would use it in a real life setting, if given to them by health care personnel.\nWe here present a framework for future health chatbot initiatives. The participatory methodology in combination with an iterative approach ensured that the patient perspective was incorporated at every level of the development process. We strongly recommend this approach in patient-centered health innovations.", "The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of sarcopenia and body composition change during primary treatment on survival outcomes in patients with early cervical cancer. We retrospectively identified patients diagnosed with 2009 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage IB1-IIA2 cervical cancer who underwent primary radical hysterectomy between 2007 and 2019. From pre-treatment CT scans (n = 306), the skeletal muscle area at the third lumbar vertebra (L3) and the waist skeletal muscle volume were measured using an artificial intelligence-based tool. These values were converted to the L3 and volumetric skeletal muscle indices by normalization. We defined L3 and volumetric sarcopenia using 39.0 cm2/m2 and the first quartile (Q1) value, respectively. From pre- and post-treatment CT scan images (n = 192), changes (%) in waist skeletal muscle and fat volumes were assessed. With the use of Cox regression models, factors associated with progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were analyzed. Between the L3 sarcopenia and non-sarcopenia groups, no differences in PFS and OS were observed. In contrast, volumetric sarcopenia was identified as a poor prognostic factor for PFS (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.874; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.028-3.416; p = 0.040) and OS (aHR, 3.001; 95% CI, 1.016-8.869; p = 0.047). During primary treatment, significant decreases in waist skeletal muscle (median, -3.9%; p < 0.001) and total fat (median, -5.3%; p < 0.001) were observed. Of the two components, multivariate analysis revealed that the waist fat gain was associated with worse PFS (aHR, 2.007; 95% CI, 1.009-3.993; p = 0.047). The coexistence of baseline volumetric sarcopenia and waist fat gain further deteriorated PFS (aHR, 2.853; 95% CI, 1.257-6.474; p = 0.012). In conclusion, baseline volumetric sarcopenia might be associated with poor survival outcomes in patients with early cervical cancer undergoing primary RH. Furthermore, sarcopenia patients who gained waist fat during primary treatment were at a high risk of disease recurrence.", "New cities exploit the smartness of the IoT-based architecture to run their vital and organizational processes. The smart response of pandemic emergency response services needs optimizing methodologies of caring and limit infection without direct connection with patients. In this paper, a hybrid Computational Intelligence (CI) algorithm called Moth-Flame Optimization and Marine Predators Algorithms (MOMPA) is proposed for planning the COVID-19 pandemic medical robot's path without collisions. MOMPA is validated on several benchmarks and compared with many CI algorithms. The results of the Friedman Ranked Mean test indicate the proposed algorithm can find the shortest collision-free path in almost all test cases. In addition, the proposed algorithm reaches an almost %100 success ratio for solving all test cases without constraint violation of the regarded problem. After the validation experiment, the proposed algorithm is applied to smart medical emergency handling in Egypt's New Galala mountainous city. Both experimental and statistical results ensure the prosperity of the proposed algorithm. Also, it ensures that MOMPA can efficiently find the shortest path to the emergency location without any collisions.", "Digital transformation is currently impacting not only health care but also education curricula for medicine and life sciences. The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the deployment of digital technologies such as the Internet of Things and artificial intelligence in diverse fields of biomedicine. Genomics and related fields of inquiry such as pharmacogenomics and personalized medicine have been making important progress over the past decades. However, the genomics knowledge of health care professionals and other stakeholders in society is not commensurate with the current state of progress in these scientific fields. The rise of digital health offers unprecedented opportunities both for health care professionals and the general public to expand their genomics literacy and education. This expert review offers an analysis of the bottlenecks that affect and issues that need to be addressed to catalyze genomics and personalized medicine education in the digital era. In addition, we summarize and critically discuss the various educational and awareness opportunities that presently exist to catalyze the delivery of genomics knowledge in ways closely attuned to the emerging field of digital health.", "To date, many artificial intelligence (AI) systems have been developed in healthcare, but adoption has been limited. This may be due to inappropriate or incomplete evaluation and a lack of internationally recognised AI standards on evaluation. To have confidence in the generalisability of AI systems in healthcare and to enable their integration into workflows, there is a need for a practical yet comprehensive instrument to assess the translational aspects of the available AI systems. Currently available evaluation frameworks for AI in healthcare focus on the reporting and regulatory aspects but have little guidance regarding assessment of the translational aspects of the AI systems like the functional, utility and ethical components.\nTo address this gap and create a framework that assesses real-world systems, an international team has developed a translationally focused evaluation framework termed 'Translational Evaluation of Healthcare AI (TEHAI)'. A critical review of literature assessed existing evaluation and reporting frameworks and gaps. Next, using health technology evaluation and translational principles, reporting components were identified for consideration. These were independently reviewed for consensus inclusion in a final framework by an international panel of eight expert.\nTEHAI includes three main components: capability, utility and adoption. The emphasis on translational and ethical features of the model development and deployment distinguishes TEHAI from other evaluation instruments. In specific, the evaluation components can be applied at any stage of the development and deployment of the AI system.\nOne major limitation of existing reporting or evaluation frameworks is their narrow focus. TEHAI, because of its strong foundation in translation research models and an emphasis on safety, translational value and generalisability, not only has a theoretical basis but also practical application to assessing real-world systems.\nThe translational research theoretic approach used to develop TEHAI should see it having application not just for evaluation of clinical AI in research settings, but more broadly to guide evaluation of working clinical systems.", "Driven by technologies such as machine learning, artificial intelligence, and internet of things, the energy efficiency and throughput limitations of the von Neumann architecture are becoming more and more serious. As a new type of computer architecture, computing-in-memory is an alternative approach to alleviate the von Neumann bottleneck. Here, we have demonstrated two kinds of computing-in-memory designs based on two-surface-channel MoS2 transistors: symmetrical 4T2R Static Random-Access Memory (SRAM) cell and skewed 3T3R SRAM cell, where the symmetrical SRAM cell can realize in-memory XNOR/XOR computations and the skewed SRAM cell can achieve in-memory NAND/NOR computations. Furthermore, since both the memory and computing units are based on two-surface-channel transistors with high area efficiency, the two proposed computing-in-memory SRAM cells consume fewer transistors, suggesting a potential application in highly area-efficient and multifunctional computing chips.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) uses mathematical algorithms to perform tasks that require human cognitive abilities. AI-based methodologies, e.g., machine learning and deep learning, as well as the recently developed research field of radiomics have noticeable potential to transform medical diagnostics. AI-based techniques applied to medical imaging allow to detect biological abnormalities, to diagnostic neoplasms or to predict the response to treatment. Nonetheless, the diagnostic accuracy of these methods is still a matter of debate. In this article, we first illustrate the key concepts and workflow characteristics of machine learning, deep learning and radiomics. We outline considerations regarding data input requirements, differences among these methodologies and their limitations. Subsequently, a concise overview is presented regarding the application of AI methods to the evaluation of thyroid images. We developed a critical discussion concerning limits and open challenges that should be addressed before the translation of AI techniques to the broad clinical use. Clarification of the pitfalls of AI-based techniques results crucial in order to ensure the optimal application for each patient.", "Diagnosis of dermatological disorders is primarily based on clinical examination in combination with histopathology. However, clinical findings alone may not be sufficient for accurate diagnosis and cutaneous biopsies are being associated with morbidity.\nThe objective of this article is to review the newer technologies along with their applications, limitation and future prospectus.\nComprehensive literature search was performed using electronic online databases \"PubMed\" and \"Google Scholar\". Articles published in English language were considered for the review.\nIn order to improve and/or widen the armamentarium in dermatologic disease diagnosis and therapy, newer emerging technologies are being made available which aid in diagnosis and management. New emerging technologies include confocal microscopy, digital photographic imaging, optical coherence tomography, high frequency ultrasonography, and artificial intelligence. There have been advancements in the dermoscopes.\nSignificant progress is seen in the diagnostic methods and imaging technologies in dermatology, each having its advantages and limitations. Artificial intelligence/machine-based learning software may have a great scope to influence the dermatological practice.", "General practitioners (GPs) are playing a key role in skin cancer screening. Non-melanoma skin cancer is frequent and difficult to diagnose. We aimed to assess whether GPs are facing difficulties in diagnosing non-pigmented skin tumours (NPSTs) and whether they would be interested in artificial intelligence (AI) software that could help them with this task. A questionnaire addressing the difficulties in diagnosing NPST and the potential interest in AI as a tool to help diagnose these tumours was emailed to GPs working in two French regions. In total, 147 respondents (98%) had faced difficulties diagnosing NPSTs; 86% agreed that an AI diagnostic tool could be useful in a GP's office and 83% agreed that it could change their practice. Nevertheless, 68% would not be willing to pay for this kind of software. GPs are facing difficulties in diagnosing NPSTs and would be interested in an AI tool that could help them achieve this. As referral to dermatology practices can be trying, AI diagnostic aids should be developed to help GPs in their gatekeeping task, however at limited cost to the GP.", "To determine the effects of levetiracetam in combination with topiramate on immune function, cognitive function, and the neuronal nutritional status of children with intractable epilepsy.\nThis study enrolled 124 children with intractable epilepsy who were admitted to our hospital. The control group included 58 children treated with topiramate, and the observation group included 66 children treated with levetiracetam and topiramate. Flow cytometry was used to determine CD4+ and CD8+ T cell counts before and after treatment in both groups.\nAfter treatment, the observation group exhibited significantly higher CD4+ T cell counts and BDNF and NGF levels and significantly lower CD8+ T cell counts and IL-6, IL-1\u03b2, and MMP-9 levels than the control group. The FIQ and VIQ of the observation group were also significantly higher than those of the control group. Additionally, the incidence rates of adverse events were not significantly different between the observation and the control groups. Finally, IL-6, IL-1\u03b2, and MMP-9 were negatively correlated with full-scale intelligence quotient (FIQ) and virtual inhibitory quotient (VIQ).\nLevetiracetam in combination with topiramate is associated with reduced inflammatory response and improved immune function, cognitive function, and neuronal nutritional status in children with intractable epilepsy.", "The potential of artificial intelligence (AI) applied to clinical data from electronic health records (EHRs) to improve early detection for pancreatic and other cancers remains underexplored. The Kenner Family Research Fund, in collaboration with the Cancer Biomarker Research Group at the National Cancer Institute, organized the workshop entitled: \"Early Detection of Pancreatic Cancer: Opportunities and Challenges in Utilizing Electronic Health Records (EHR)\" in March 2021. The workshop included a select group of panelists with expertise in pancreatic cancer, EHR data mining, and AI-based modeling. This review article reflects the findings from the workshop and assesses the feasibility of AI-based data extraction and modeling applied to EHRs. It highlights the increasing role of data sharing networks and common data models in improving the secondary use of EHR data. Current efforts using EHR data for AI-based modeling to enhance early detection of pancreatic cancer show promise.

Brain tumour surgery augmented with AI can result in safer and more effective treatment. In this review article, we explore the current and future role of AI in patients undergoing brain tumour surgery, including aiding diagnosis, optimising the surgical plan, providing support during the operation, and better predicting the prognosis. Finally, we discuss barriers to the successful clinical implementation, the ethical concerns, and we provide our perspective on how the field could be advanced.", "Metastatic carcinomas of bone marrow (MCBM) are characterized as tumors of non-hematopoietic origin spreading to the bone marrow through blood or lymphatic circulation. The diagnosis is critical for tumor staging, treatment selection and prognostic risk stratification. However, the identification of metastatic carcinoma cells on bone marrow aspiration smears is technically challenging by conventional microscopic\u00a0screening.\nThe aim of this study is to develop an automatic recognition system using deep learning algorithms applied to bone marrow cells image analysis. The system takes advantage of an artificial intelligence (AI)-based method in recognizing metastatic atypical cancer clusters and promoting rapid diagnosis.\nWe retrospectively reviewed metastatic non-hematopoietic malignancies in bone marrow aspirate smears collected from 60 cases of patients admitted to Zhongshan Hospital. High resolution digital bone marrow aspirate smear images were generated and automatically analyzed by Morphogo AI based system. Morphogo system was trained and validated using 20748 cell cluster images from randomly selected 50 MCBM patients. 5469 pre-classified cell cluster images from the remaining 10 MCBM patients were used to test the recognition performance between Morphogo and experienced pathologists.\nMorphogo exhibited a sensitivity of 56.6%, a specificity of 91.3%, and an accuracy of 82.2% in the recognition of metastatic cancer cells. Morphogo's classification result was in general agreement with the conventional standard in the diagnosis of metastatic cancer clusters, with a Kappa value of 0.513. The test results between Morphogo and pathologists H1, H2 and H3 agreement demonstrated a reliability coefficient of 0.827. The area under the curve (AUC) for Morphogo to diagnose the cancer cell clusters was 0.865.\nIn patients with clinical history of cancer, the Morphogo system was validated as a useful screening tool in the identification of metastatic cancer cells in the bone marrow aspirate smears. It has potential clinical application in the diagnostic assessment of metastatic cancers for staging and in screening MCBM during morphology examination when the symptoms of the primary site are indolent.", "Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) annually take almost 18 million lives worldwide. Most lethal events occur months or years after the initial presentation. Indeed, many patients experience repeated complications or require multiple interventions (recurrent events). Apart from affecting the individual, this leads to high medical costs for society. Personalized treatment strategies aiming at prediction and prevention of recurrent events rely on early diagnosis and precise prognosis. Complementing the traditional environmental and clinical risk factors, multi-omics data provide a holistic view of the patient and disease progression, enabling studies to probe novel angles in risk stratification. Specifically, predictive molecular markers allow insights into regulatory networks, pathways, and mechanisms underlying disease. Moreover, artificial intelligence (AI) represents a powerful, yet adaptive, framework able to recognize complex patterns in large-scale clinical and molecular data with the potential to improve risk prediction. Here, we review the most recent advances in risk prediction of recurrent cardiovascular events, and discuss the value of molecular data and biomarkers for understanding patient risk in a systems biology context. Finally, we introduce explainable AI which may improve clinical decision systems by making predictions transparent to the medical practitioner.", "Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have demonstrated potential to improve medical diagnosis. We piloted the end-to-end automation of the mid-trimester screening ultrasound scan using AI-enabled tools.\nA prospective method comparison study was conducted. Participants had both standard and AI-assisted US scans performed. The AI tools automated image acquisition, biometric measurement, and report production. A feedback survey captured the sonographers' perceptions of scanning.\nTwenty-three subjects were studied. The average time saving per scan was 7.62\u00a0min (34.7%) with the AI-assisted method (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). There was no difference in reporting time. There were no clinically significant differences in biometric measurements between the two methods. The AI tools saved a satisfactory view in 93% of the cases (four core views only), and 73% for the full 13 views, compared to 98% for both using the manual scan. Survey responses suggest that the AI tools helped sonographers to concentrate on image interpretation by removing disruptive tasks.\nSeparating freehand scanning from image capture and measurement resulted in a faster scan and altered workflow. Removing repetitive tasks may allow more attention to be directed identifying fetal malformation. Further work\u00a0is required to improve the image plane detection algorithm for use in real time.", "The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic is unarguably the biggest catastrophe of the 21st century, probably the most significant global crisis after the second world war. The rapid spreading capability of the virus has compelled the world population to maintain strict preventive measures. The outrage of the virus has rampaged through the healthcare sector tremendously. This pandemic created a huge demand for necessary healthcare equipment, medicines along with the requirement for advanced robotics and artificial intelligence-based applications. The intelligent robot systems have great potential to render service in diagnosis, risk assessment, monitoring, telehealthcare, disinfection, and several other operations during this pandemic which has helped reduce the workload of the frontline workers remarkably. The long-awaited vaccine discovery of this deadly virus has also been greatly accelerated with AI-empowered tools. In addition to that, many robotics and Robotics Process Automation platforms have substantially facilitated the distribution of the vaccine in many arrangements pertaining to it. These forefront technologies have also aided in giving comfort to the people dealing with less addressed mental health complicacies. This paper investigates the use of robotics and artificial intelligence-based technologies and their applications in healthcare to fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. A systematic search following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) method is conducted to accumulate such literature, and an extensive review on 147 selected records is performed.", "Additive manufacturing is promising a flexible and economical alternative to traditional manufacturing. Aviation industry is one such sector that additive manufacturing brought about major transformations. Wire arc additive manufacturing plays an important role in aviation companies to reduce carbon emissions, increase efficiency and allow tailor-made components. However, there are some technical challenges such as microstructural porosity and voids that need to be addressed before they go into full-fledge adoption. Artificial Intelligence (AI) can play a key role in porosity detection. However, applicability of AI for porosity detection is limited due to the difficulties in collecting large amounts of data. The present article demonstrates machine learning models for porosity detection in microstructural images of wire-arc additively manufactured aluminium alloy 6061 parts with limited dataset. Segmentation of pores from microstructures is performed based on pixel-level color and texture features obtained by using Gabor filters. The machine learning models, whose hyperparameters are chosen from cross-validation, achieved an average classification accuracy of 98.89 % (random forest) for porosity detection with pores above the size of 5 \u03bcm. Experimental results show that the proposed methods are very effective when compared to the recently proposed methods in the literature.", "The current gold standard comprehensive assessment of coronary microvascular dysfunction (CMD) is through a limited-access invasive catheterization lab procedure. We aimed to develop a point-of-care tool to assist clinical guidance in patients presenting with chest pain and/or an abnormal cardiac functional stress test and with non-obstructive coronary artery disease (NOCAD).\nThis study included 1893 NOCAD patients (<50% angiographic stenosis) who underwent CMD evaluation as well as an electrocardiogram (ECG) up to 1-year prior. Endothelial-independent CMD was defined by coronary flow reserve (CFR) \u22642.5 in response to intracoronary adenosine. Endothelial-dependent CMD was defined by a maximal percent increase in coronary blood flow (%\u0394CBF) \u226450% in response to intracoronary acetylcholine infusion. We trained algorithms to distinguish between the following outcomes: CFR \u22642.5, %\u0394CBF \u226450, and the combination of both. Two classes of algorithms were trained, one depending on ECG waveforms as input, and another using tabular clinical data. Mean age was 51\u2009\u00b1\u200912\u2009years and 66% were females (n\u2009=\u20091257). Area under the curve values ranged from 0.49 to 0.67 for all the outcomes. The best performance in our analysis was for the outcome CFR \u22642.5 with clinical variables. Area under the curve and accuracy were 0.67% and 60%. When decreasing the threshold of positivity, sensitivity and negative predictive value increased to 92% and 90%, respectively, while specificity and positive predictive value decreased to 25% and 29%, respectively.\nAn artificial intelligence-enabled algorithm may be able to assist clinical guidance by ruling out CMD in patients presenting with chest pain and/or an abnormal functional stress test. This algorithm needs to be prospectively validated in different cohorts.", "Much of the controversy evoked by the use of deep neural networks as models of biological neural systems amount to debates over what constitutes scientific progress in neuroscience. To discuss what constitutes scientific progress, one must have a goal in mind (progress toward what?). One such long-term goal is to produce scientific explanations of intelligent capacities (e.g., object recognition, relational reasoning). I argue that the most pressing philosophical questions at the intersection of neuroscience and artificial intelligence are ultimately concerned with defining the phenomena to be explained and with what constitute valid explanations of such phenomena. I propose that a foundation in the philosophy of scientific explanation and understanding can scaffold future discussions about how an integrated science of intelligence might progress. Toward this vision, I review relevant theories of scientific explanation and discuss strategies for unifying the scientific goals of neuroscience and AI.", "Policymakers need to start considering the impact smart connected toys (SCTs) have on children. Equipped with sensors, data processing capacities, and connectivity, SCTs targeting children increasingly penetrate pervasively personal environments. The network of SCTs forms the Internet of Toys (IoToys) and often increases children's engagement and playtime experience. Unfortunately, this young part of the population and, most of the time, their parents are often unaware of SCTs' far-reaching capacities and limitations. The capabilities and constraints of SCTs create severe side effects at the technical, individual, and societal level. These side effects are often unforeseeable and unexpected. They arise from the technology's use and the interconnected nature of the IoToys, without necessarily involving malevolence from their creators. Although existing regulations and new ethical guidelines for artificial intelligence provide remedies to address some of the side effects, policymakers did not develop these redress mechanisms having children and SCTs in mind. This article provides an analysis of the arising side effects of SCTs and contrasts them with current regulatory redress mechanisms. We thereby highlight misfits and needs for further policymaking efforts.", "Use of telehealth to deliver neuropsychological services has proven to be a feasible approach, however, there is limited research which has examined the reliability of home-based assessment models using a comprehensive intelligence test. The aim of this study was to examine the reliability and feasibility of a home-based videoconferencing administration of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scales-4th Edition (WAIS-IV). Thirty healthy participants (aged 18-40\u2009years) completed the WAIS-IV both in-person and via home-based videoconferencing utilizing a randomized counter-balanced methodology to attempt to control for an order effect. Paper record forms for Coding/Symbol Search and Blocks were sent and returned via tamper proof courier packs. Participants completed an online survey of their experiences of TNP following completion of their assessments. Group mean comparisons, intra class correlation coefficients (ICCs) and Bland-Altman measures of bias were calculated. Findings from both modalities were highly concordant across all WAIS-IV subtests and indices, with all ICCs rated as \"excellent,\" (\u22650.9). There were no significant mean group differences and no evidence of proportional bias. The majority of participants were very satisfied with the use of videoconferencing as an application for cognitive assessment and high levels of participant compliance were observed. In this non-clinical cohort home-based videoconference administration of the WAIS-IV was feasible, reliable and acceptable. TNP may offer an alternative for those consumers where there are challenges in accessing a face-to-face service delivery model, thereby improving equity, and enabling continuation of service delivery. Future research is needed with a larger and more ethnically diverse clinical population.", "In the development of artificial intelligence in ophthalmology, the ophthalmic AI-related recognition issues are prominent, but there is a lack of research into people's familiarity with and their attitudes toward ophthalmic AI. This survey aims to assess medical workers' and other professional technicians' familiarity with, attitudes toward, and concerns about AI in ophthalmology.\nThis is a cross-sectional study design study. An electronic questionnaire was designed through the app Questionnaire Star, and was sent to respondents through WeChat, China's version of Facebook or WhatsApp. The participation was voluntary and anonymous. The questionnaire consisted of four parts, namely the respondents' background, their basic understanding of AI, their attitudes toward AI, and their concerns about AI. A total of 562 respondents were counted, with 562 valid questionnaires returned. The results of the questionnaires are displayed in an Excel 2003 form.\nThere were 291 medical workers and 271 other professional technicians completed the questionnaire. About 1/3 of the respondents understood AI and ophthalmic AI. The percentages of people who understood ophthalmic AI among medical workers and other professional technicians were about 42.6\u2009% and 15.6\u2009%, respectively. About 66.0\u2009% of the respondents thought that AI in ophthalmology would partly replace doctors, about 59.07\u2009% having a relatively high acceptance level of ophthalmic AI. Meanwhile, among those with AI in ophthalmology application experiences (30.6\u2009%), above 70\u2009% of respondents held a full acceptance attitude toward AI in ophthalmology. The respondents expressed medical ethics concerns about AI in ophthalmology. And among the respondents who understood AI in ophthalmology, almost all the people said that there was a need to increase the study of medical ethics issues in the ophthalmic AI field.\nThe survey results revealed that the medical workers had a higher understanding level of AI in ophthalmology than other professional technicians, making it necessary to popularize ophthalmic AI education among other professional technicians. Most of the respondents did not have any experience in ophthalmic AI but generally had a relatively high acceptance level of AI in ophthalmology, and there was a need to strengthen research into medical ethics issues.", "At present, numerous challenges exist in the diagnosis of pancreatic SCNs and MCNs. After the emergence of artificial intelligence (AI), many radiomics research methods have been applied to the identification of pancreatic SCNs and MCNs.\nA deep neural network (DNN) model termed Multi-channel-Multiclassifier-Random Forest-ResNet (MMRF-ResNet) was constructed to provide an objective CT imaging basis for differential diagnosis between pancreatic serous cystic neoplasms (SCNs) and mucinous cystic neoplasms (MCNs).\nThis study is a retrospective analysis of pancreatic unenhanced and enhanced CT images in 63 patients with pancreatic SCNs and 47 patients with MCNs (3 of which were mucinous cystadenocarcinoma) confirmed by pathology from December 2010 to August 2016. Different image segmented methods (single-channel manual outline ROI image and multi-channel image), feature extraction methods (wavelet, LBP, HOG, GLCM, Gabor, ResNet, and AlexNet) and classifiers (KNN, Softmax, Bayes, random forest classifier, and Majority Voting rule method) are used to classify the nature of the lesion in each CT image (SCNs/MCNs). Then, the comparisons of classification results were made based on sensitivity, specificity, precision, accuracy, F1 score, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), with pathological results serving as the gold standard.\nMulti-channel-ResNet (AUC 0.98) was superior to Manual-ResNet (AUC 0.91).CT image characteristics of lesions extracted by ResNet are more representative than wavelet, LBP, HOG, GLCM, Gabor, and AlexNet. Compared to the use of three classifiers alone and Majority Voting rule method, the use of the MMRF-ResNet model exhibits a better evaluation effect (AUC 0.96) for the classification of the pancreatic SCNs and MCNs.\nThe CT image classification model MMRF-ResNet is an effective method to distinguish between pancreatic SCNs and MCNs.", "Advancement of the ultra-fast microscopic images acquisition and generation techniques give rise to the automated artificial intelligence (AI)-based microscopic images classification systems. The earlier cell classification systems classify the cell images of a specific type captured using a specific microscopy technique, therefore the motivation behind the present study is to develop a generic framework that can be used for the classification of cell images of multiple types captured using a variety of microscopic techniques.\nThe proposed framework for microscopic cell images classification is based on the transfer learning-based multi-level ensemble approach. The ensemble is made by training the same base model with different optimisation methods and different learning rates. An important contribution of the proposed framework lies in its ability to capture different granularities of features extracted from multiple scales of an input microscopic cell image. The base learners used in the proposed ensemble encapsulates the aggregation of low-level coarse features and high-level semantic features, thus, represent the different granular microscopic cell image features present at different scales of input cell images. The batch normalisation layer has been added to the base models for the fast convergence in the proposed ensemble for microscopic cell images classification.\nThe general applicability of the proposed framework for microscopic cell image classification has been tested with five different public datasets. The proposed method has outperformed the experimental results obtained in several other similar works.\nThe proposed framework for microscopic cell classification outperforms the other state-of-the-art classification methods in the same domain with a comparatively lesser amount of training data.", "The incorporation of electronics onto curved surfaces promises to bring new levels of intelligence to the ergonomic, aesthetic, aerodynamic, and optical surfaces that are ever-present in our\u00a0lives. However, since many of these surfaces have 2D (i.e., nondevelopable) curvature, they cannot be formed from the deformation of a flat, nonstretchable sheet. This means that curved electronics cannot capitalize on the rapid technological advances taking place in the field of ultrathin electronics, since ultrathin devices, though ultraflexible, are not stretchable. In this work, a shrink-based paradigm is presented to apply such thin-film electronics to nondevelopable surfaces, expanding the capabilities of current nondevelopable electronics, and linking future developments in thin-film technology to similar developments in curved devices. The wrinkling of parylene-based devices and the effects of shrinkage on common electrical components are examined, culminating in shrinkable touch sensors and organic photovoltaics, laminated to various nondevelopable surfaces without loss of performance.", "Human variation in brain morphology and behavior are related and highly heritable. Yet, it is largely unknown to what extent specific features of brain morphology and behavior are genetically related. Here, we introduce a computationally efficient approach for multivariate genomic-relatedness-based restricted maximum likelihood (MGREML) to estimate the genetic correlation between a large number of phenotypes simultaneously. Using individual-level data (N\u2009=\u200920,190) from the UK Biobank, we provide estimates of the heritability of gray-matter volume in 74 regions of interest (ROIs) in the brain and we map genetic correlations between these ROIs and health-relevant behavioral outcomes, including intelligence. We find four genetically distinct clusters in the brain that are aligned with standard anatomical subdivision in neuroscience. Behavioral traits have distinct genetic correlations with brain morphology which suggests trait-specific relevance of ROIs. These empirical results illustrate how MGREML can be used to estimate internally consistent and high-dimensional genetic correlation matrices in large datasets.", "Human interaction with the world is dominated by uncertainty. Probability theory is a valuable tool to face such uncertainty. According to the Bayesian definition, probabilities are personal beliefs. Experimental evidence supports the notion that human behavior is highly consistent with Bayesian probabilistic inference in both the sensory and motor and cognitive domain. All the higher-level psychophysical functions of our brain are believed to take the activities of interconnected and distributed networks of neurons in the neocortex as their physiological substrate. Neurons in the neocortex are organized in cortical columns that behave as fuzzy sets. Fuzzy sets theory has embraced uncertainty modeling when membership functions have been reinterpreted as possibility distributions. The terms of Bayes' formula are conceivable as fuzzy sets and Bayes' inference becomes a fuzzy inference. According to the QBism, quantum probabilities are also Bayesian. They are logical constructs rather than physical realities. It derives that the Born rule is nothing but a kind of Quantum Law of Total Probability. Wavefunctions and measurement operators are viewed epistemically. Both of them are similar to fuzzy sets. The new link that is established between fuzzy logic, neuroscience, and quantum mechanics through Bayesian probability could spark new ideas for the development of artificial intelligence and unconventional computing.", "Legumes are a better source of proteins and are richer in diverse micronutrients over the nutritional profile of widely consumed cereals. However, when exposed to a diverse range of abiotic stresses, their overall productivity and quality are hugely impacted. Our limited understanding of genetic determinants and novel variants associated with the abiotic stress response in food legume crops restricts its amelioration. Therefore, it is imperative to understand different molecular approaches in food legume crops that can be utilized in crop improvement programs to minimize the economic loss. 'Omics'-based molecular breeding provides better opportunities over conventional breeding for diversifying the natural germplasm together with improving yield and quality parameters. Due to molecular advancements, the technique is now equipped with novel 'omics' approaches such as ionomics, epigenomics, fluxomics, RNomics, glycomics, glycoproteomics, phosphoproteomics, lipidomics, regulomics, and secretomics. Pan-omics-which utilizes the molecular bases of the stress response to identify genes (genomics), mRNAs (transcriptomics), proteins (proteomics), and biomolecules (metabolomics) associated with stress regulation-has been widely used for abiotic stress amelioration in food legume crops. Integration of pan-omics with novel omics approaches will fast-track legume breeding programs. Moreover, artificial intelligence (AI)-based algorithms can be utilized for simulating crop yield under changing environments, which can help in predicting the genetic gain beforehand. Application of machine learning (ML) in quantitative trait loci (QTL) mining will further help in determining the genetic determinants of abiotic stress tolerance in pulses.", "Organic-inorganic hybrid perovskites exhibit superior optoelectrical properties and have been widely used in photodetectors. Perovskite photodetectors with excellent detectivity have great potential for developing artificial photonic synapses which can merge data transmission and storage. They are highly desired for next generation neuromorphic computing. The recent progress of perovskite photodetectors and their application in artificial photonic synapses are summarized in this review. Firstly, the key performance parameters of photodetectors are briefly introduced. Secondly, the recent research progress of photodetectors including photoconductors, photodiodes, and phototransistors is summarized. Finally, the applications of perovskite photodetectors in artificial photonic synapses in recent years are highlighted. All these demonstrate the great potential of perovskite photonic synapses for the development of artificial intelligence.", "Livestock animals are sentient beings with cognitive and emotional capacities and their brain development, similar to humans and other animal species, is affected by their surrounding environmental conditions. Current intensive production systems, through the restrictions of safely managing large numbers of animals, may not facilitate optimal neurological development which can contribute to negative affective states, abnormal behaviors, and reduce experiences of positive welfare states. Enrichment provision is likely necessary to enable animals to reach toward their neurological potential, optimizing their cognitive capacity and emotional intelligence, improving their ability to cope with stressors as well as experience positive affect. However, greater understanding of the neurological impacts of specific types of enrichment strategies is needed to ensure enrichment programs are effectively improving the individual's welfare. Enrichment programs during animal development that target key neurological pathways that may be most utilized by the individual within specific types of housing or management situations is proposed to result in the greatest positive impacts on animal welfare. Research within livestock animals is needed in this regard to ensure future deployment of enrichment for livestock animals is widespread and effective in enhancing their neurological capacities.", "Coronary artery disease (CAD) represents one of the most important causes of death around the world. Multimodality imaging plays a fundamental role in both diagnosis and risk stratification of acute and chronic CAD. For example, the role of Coronary Computed Tomography Angiography (CCTA) has become increasingly important to rule out CAD according to the latest guidelines. These changes and others will likely increase the request for appropriate imaging tests in the future. In this setting, artificial intelligence (AI) will play a pivotal role in echocardiography, CCTA, cardiac magnetic resonance and nuclear imaging, making multimodality imaging more efficient and reliable for clinicians, as well as more sustainable for healthcare systems. Furthermore, AI can assist clinicians in identifying early predictors of adverse outcome that human eyes cannot see in the fog of \"big data.\" AI algorithms applied to multimodality imaging will play a fundamental role in the management of patients with suspected or established CAD. This study aims to provide a comprehensive overview of current and future AI applications to the field of multimodality imaging of ischemic heart disease.", "We envisage the development of new Brain Health Services to achieve primary and secondary dementia prevention. These services will complement existing memory clinics by targeting cognitively unimpaired individuals, where the focus is on risk profiling and personalized risk reduction interventions rather than diagnosing and treating late-stage disease. In this article, we review key potentially modifiable risk factors and genetic risk factors and discuss assessment of risk factors as well as additional fluid and imaging biomarkers that may enhance risk profiling. We then outline multidomain measures and risk profiling and provide practical guidelines for Brain Health Services, with consideration of outstanding uncertainties and challenges. Users of Brain Health Services should undergo risk profiling tailored to their age, level of risk, and availability of local resources. Initial risk assessment should incorporate a multidomain risk profiling measure. For users aged 39-64, we recommend the Cardiovascular Risk Factors, Aging, and Incidence of Dementia (CAIDE) Dementia Risk Score, whereas for users aged 65 and older, we recommend the Brief Dementia Screening Indicator (BDSI) and the Australian National University Alzheimer's Disease Risk Index (ANU-ADRI). The initial assessment should also include potentially modifiable risk factors including sociodemographic, lifestyle, and health factors. If resources allow, apolipoprotein E \u025b4 status testing and structural magnetic resonance imaging should be conducted. If this initial assessment indicates a low dementia risk, then low intensity interventions can be implemented. If the user has a high dementia risk, additional investigations should be considered if local resources allow. Common variant polygenic risk of late-onset AD can be tested in middle-aged or older adults. Rare variants should only be investigated in users with a family history of early-onset dementia in a first degree relative. Advanced imaging with 18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) or amyloid PET may be informative in high risk users to clarify the nature and burden of their underlying pathologies. Cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers are not recommended for this setting, and blood-based biomarkers need further validation before clinical use. As new technologies become available, advances in artificial intelligence are likely to improve our ability to combine diverse data to further enhance risk profiling. Ultimately, Brain Health Services have the potential to reduce the future burden of dementia through risk profiling, risk communication, personalized risk reduction, and cognitive enhancement interventions.", "Lignocellulosic biomass is one of the most promising renewable resources and can replace fossil fuels via various biorefinery processes. Through this study, we addressed and analyzed recent advances in the thermochemical conversion of various lignocellulosic biomasses. We summarized the operation conditions and results related to each thermochemical conversion processes such as pyrolysis (torrefaction), hydrothermal treatment, gasification and combustion. This review indicates that using thermochemical conversion processes in biorefineries is techno-economically feasible, easy, and effective compared with biological processes. The challenges experienced in thermochemical conversion processes are also presented in this study for better understanding the future of thermochemical conversion processes for biorefinery. With the aid of artificial intelligence and machine learning, we can reduce time-consumption and experimental work for bio-oil production and syngas production processes.", "Since the outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, over 103214008 cases have been reported, with more than 2231158 deaths as of January 31, 2021. Although the gold standard for diagnosis of this disease remains the reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction of nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs, its false-negative rates have ignited the use of medical imaging as an important adjunct or alternative. Medical imaging assists in identifying the pathogenesis, the degree of pulmonary damage, and the characteristic features in each imaging modality. This literature review collates the characteristic radiographic findings of COVID-19 in various imaging modalities while keeping the preliminary focus on chest radiography, computed tomography (CT), and ultrasound scans. Given the higher sensitivity and greater proficiency in detecting characteristic findings during the early stages, CT scans are more reliable in diagnosis and serve as a practical method in following up the disease time course. As research rapidly expands, we have emphasized the CO-RADS classification system as a tool to aid in communicating the likelihood of COVID-19 suspicion among healthcare workers. Additionally, the utilization of other scoring systems such as MuLBSTA, Radiological Assessment of Lung Edema, and Brixia in this pandemic are reviewed as they integrate the radiographic findings into an objective scoring system to risk stratify the patients and predict the severity of disease. Furthermore, current progress in the utilization of artificial intelligence via radiomics is evaluated. Lastly, the lesson from the first wave and preparation for the second wave from the point of view of radiology are summarized.", "Recently, advancements in computational machinery have facilitated the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) to almost every field and industry. This fast-paced development in AI and sensing technologies have stirred an evolution in the realm of robotics. Concurrently, augmented reality (AR) applications are providing solutions to a myriad of robotics applications, such as demystifying robot motion intent and supporting intuitive control and feedback. In this paper, research papers combining the potentials of AI and AR in robotics over the last decade are presented and systematically reviewed. Four sources for data collection were utilized: Google Scholar, Scopus database, the International Conference on Robotics and Automation 2020 proceedings, and the references and citations of all identified papers. A total of 29 papers were analyzed from two perspectives: a theme-based perspective showcasing the relation between AR and AI, and an application-based analysis highlighting how the robotics application was affected. These two sections are further categorized based on the type of robotics platform and the type of robotics application, respectively. We analyze the work done and highlight some of the prevailing limitations hindering the field. Results also explain how AR and AI can be combined to solve the model-mismatch paradigm by creating a closed feedback loop between the user and the robot. This forms a solid base for increasing the efficiency of the robotic application and enhancing the user's situational awareness, safety, and acceptance of AI robots. Our findings affirm the promising future for robust integration of AR and AI in numerous robotic applications.", "Infectious diseases accompanied mankind throughout its existence. However, in the 20th century, with the implementation od mass vaccination, this problem was partially forgotten. It reappeared at the end of the 2019 with the COVID-19 pandemic. The diseases are associated with high mortality, the main causes of which are: respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome, thrombotic complications, etc. As many centuries ago, the key to fighting a pandemic is to diagnose patients with infections as quickly as possible, isolate them, and implement treatment procedures. In this paper we propose a Platform supporting medics in the fight against epidemic. Unlike alternative systems, the proposed IT Platform will ultimately cover all areas of fighting against COVID-19, from the diagnosis of infection, through treatment, to rehabilitation of post-disease complications. Like most clinical information systems, the Platform is based on Artificial Intelligence, in particular Federated Learning. Also, unlike known solutions, it uses all available historical data of the patient's health and information from real-time mobile diagnostics, using cellular communication and Internet of Things solutions. Such solutions could be helpful in fighting against any future mass infections.", "Artificial intelligence and machine learning in orthopaedic surgery has gained mass interest over the last decade or so. In prior studies, researchers have demonstrated that machine learning in orthopaedics can be used for different applications such as fracture detection, bone tumor diagnosis, detecting hip implant mechanical loosening, and grading osteoarthritis. As time goes on, the utility of artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms, such as deep learning, continues to grow and expand in orthopaedic surgery. The purpose of this review is to provide an understanding of the concepts of machine learning and a background of current and future orthopaedic applications of machine learning in risk assessment, outcomes assessment, imaging, and basic science fields. In most cases, machine learning has proven to be just as effective, if not more effective, than prior methods such as logistic regression in assessment and prediction. With the help of deep learning algorithms, such as artificial neural networks and convolutional neural networks, artificial intelligence in orthopaedics has been able to improve diagnostic accuracy and speed, flag the most critical and urgent patients for immediate attention, reduce the amount of human error, reduce the strain on medical professionals, and improve care. Because machine learning has shown diagnostic and prognostic uses in orthopaedic surgery, physicians should continue to research these techniques and be trained to use these methods effectively in order to improve orthopaedic treatment.", "Depressive symptoms are associated with a decline of episodic memory, but the relationship with semantic memory remains unclear.\nThe aim of the study was to analyze the relationship of depressive symptoms with the semantic memory in a community-based sample of elderly adults. The sample comprised two groups, namely, clinical (with depressive symptoms) and control.\nThe following instruments were used General Evaluation Questionnaire, Montreal Cognitive Assessment-Basic, Wechsler Abbreviate Scale of Intelligence, Geriatric Depression Scale-30 (GDS-30), Beck Depression Inventory-II, Boston Nomination Test (BNT), vocabulary, verbal fluency test (fruits and animals), and Brief Cognitive Screening Battery.\nThe results showed a significant difference between groups only in BNT. A significant correlation was observed between the BNT and GDS-30. Participants with symptoms of severe depression performed poorly on BNT when compared with individuals with mild symptoms.\nThese results support the hypothesis that depressive symptoms in elderly adults can affect semantic memory and may worsen with the severity of symptoms.\nSintomas depressivos est\u00e3o associados ao decl\u00ednio da mem\u00f3ria epis\u00f3dica, mas sua rela\u00e7\u00e3o com a mem\u00f3ria sem\u00e2ntica permanece obscura.\nO objetivo deste estudo foi analisar a rela\u00e7\u00e3o dos sintomas depressivos \u00e0 mem\u00f3ria sem\u00e2ntica em idosos que vivem na comunidade.

Os participantes com sintomas de depress\u00e3o grave tiveram um desempenho pior no BNT, quando comparados aos indiv\u00edduos com sintomas leves.\nEsses resultados apoiam a hip\u00f3tese de que os sintomas depressivos em idosos podem afetar a mem\u00f3ria sem\u00e2ntica e aumentam com a gravidade dos sintomas.", "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common symptom of aggressive and irreversible dementia that affects people's ability of daily life. At present, neuroimaging technology plays an important role in the evaluation and early diagnosis of AD. With the widespread application of artificial intelligence in the medical field, deep learning has shown great potential in computer-aided AD diagnosis based on MRI.\nIn this study, we proposed a deep learning framework based on sMRI gray matter slice for AD diagnosis. Compared with the previous methods based on deep learning, our method enhanced gray matter feature information more effectively by combination of slice region and attention mechanism, which can improve the accuracy on the AD diagnosis.\nTo ensure the performance of our proposed method, the experiment was evaluated on T1 weighted structural MRI (sMRI) images with non-leakage splitting from the ADNI database. Our method can achieve 0.90 accuracy in classification of AD/NC and 0.825 accuracy in classification of AD/MCI, which has better diagnostic performance and advantages than other competitive single-modality methods based on sMRI. Furthermore, we indicated the most discriminative brain MRI slice area determined for AD diagnosis.\nOur proposed method based on the regional attention with GM slice has a 1%-8% improvement in accuracy compared with several state-of-the-art methods for AD diagnosis.\nThe results of experiment indicate that our method can focus more effective features in the gray matter of coronal slices and to achieve a more accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. This study can provide a more remarkably effective approach and more objective evaluation for the diagnosis of AD based on sMRI slice images.", "Africa is undergoing both an environmental and an epidemiological transition. Household air pollution is the predominant form of air pollution, but it is declining, whereas ambient air pollution is increasing. We aimed to quantify how air pollution is affecting health, human capital, and the economy across Africa, with a particular focus on Ethiopia, Ghana, and Rwanda.\nData on household and ambient air pollution were from WHO Global Health Observatory, and data on morbidity and mortality were from the 2019 Global Burden of Disease Study. We estimated economic output lost due to air pollution-related disease by country, with use of labour income per worker, adjusted by the probability that a person (of a given age) was working. Losses were expressed in 2019 international dollars and as a proportion of gross domestic product (GDP). We also quantified the contribution of particulate matter (PM)2\u00b75 pollution to intelligence quotient (IQ) loss in children younger than 10 years, with use of an exposure-response coefficient based on previously published data.\nAir pollution was responsible for 1\u00b71 million deaths across Africa in 2019. Household air pollution accounted for 697\u2008000 deaths and ambient air pollution for 394\u2008000. Ambient air pollution-related deaths increased from 361\u2008000 in 2015, to 383\u2008000 in 2019, with the greatest increases in the most highly developed countries. The majority of deaths due to ambient air pollution are caused by non-communicable diseases. The loss in economic output in 2019 due to air pollution-related morbidity and mortality was $3\u00b702 billion in Ethiopia (1\u00b716% of GDP), $1\u00b763 billion in Ghana (0\u00b795% of GDP), and $349 million in Rwanda (1\u00b719% of GDP). PM2\u00b75 pollution was estimated to be responsible for 1\u00b796 billion lost IQ points in African children in 2019.\nAmbient air pollution is increasing across Africa. In the absence of deliberate intervention, it will increase morbidity and mortality, diminish economic productivity, impair human capital formation, and undercut development. Because most African countries are still early in development, they have opportunities to transition rapidly to wind and solar energy, avoiding a reliance on fossil fuel-based economies and minimising pollution.\nUN Environment Programme.", "In this paper, an intelligent perceiving and planning system based on deep learning is proposed for a collaborative robot consisting of a 7-DoF (7-degree-of-freedom) manipulator, a three-finger robot hand, and a vision system, known as IPPS (intelligent perceiving and planning system). The lack of intelligence has been limiting the application of collaborative robots for a long time. A system to realize \"eye-brain-hand\" process is crucial for the true intelligence of robots. In this research, a more stable and accurate perceiving process was proposed. A well-designed camera system as the vision system and a new hand tracking method were proposed for operation perceiving and recording set establishment to improve the applicability. A visual process was designed to improve the accuracy of environment perceiving. Besides, a faster and more precise planning process was proposed. Deep learning based on a new CNN (convolution neural network) was designed to realize intelligent grasping planning for robot hand. A new trajectory planning method of the manipulator was proposed to improve efficiency. The performance of the IPPS was tested with simulations and experiments in a real environment. The results show that IPPS could effectively realize intelligent perceiving and planning for the robot, which could realize higher intelligence and great applicability for collaborative robots.", "Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) are grouped into two cell types; embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). hESCs have provided multiple powerful platforms to study human biology, including human development and diseases; however, there were difficulties in the establishment of hESCs from human embryo and concerns over its ethical issues. The discovery of hiPSCs has expanded to various applications in no time because hiPSCs had already overcome these problems. Many hPSC-based studies have been performed using two-dimensional monocellular culture methods at the cellular level. However, in many physiological and pathophysiological conditions, intra- and inter-organ interactions play an essential role, which has hampered the establishment of an appropriate study model. Therefore, the application of recently developed technologies, such as three-dimensional organoids, bioengineering, and organ-on-a-chip technology, has great potential for constructing multicellular tissues, generating the functional organs from hPSCs, and recapitulating complex tissue functions for better biological research and disease modeling. Moreover, emerging techniques, such as single-cell transcriptomics, spatial transcriptomics, and artificial intelligence (AI) allowed for a denser and more precise analysis of such heterogeneous and complex tissues. Here, we review the applications of hPSCs to construct complex organs and discuss further prospects of disease modeling and drug discovery based on these PSC-derived organs.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms together with advances in data storage have recently made it possible to better characterize, predict, prevent, and treat a range of psychiatric illnesses. Amid the rapidly growing number of biological devices and the exponential accumulation of data in the mental health sector, the upcoming years are facing a need to homogenize research and development processes in academia as well as in the private sector and to centralize data into federalizing platforms. This has become even more important in light of the current global pandemic. Here, we propose an end-to-end methodology that optimizes and homogenizes digital research processes. Each step of the process is elaborated from project conception to knowledge extraction, with a focus on data analysis. The methodology is based on iterative processes, thus allowing an adaptation to the rate at which digital technologies evolve. The methodology also advocates for interdisciplinary (from mathematics to psychology) and intersectoral (from academia to the industry) collaborations to merge the gap between fundamental and applied research. We also pinpoint the ethical challenges and technical and human biases (from data recorded to the end user) associated with digital mental health. In conclusion, our work provides guidelines for upcoming digital mental health studies, which will accompany the translation of fundamental mental health research to digital technologies.", "The detection of rib fractures (RFs) on computed tomography (CT) images is time-consuming and susceptible to missed diagnosis. An automated artificial intelligence (AI) detection system may be helpful to improve the diagnostic efficiency for junior radiologists.\nTo compare the diagnostic performance of junior radiologists with and without AI software for RF detection on chest CT images.\nSix junior radiologists from three institutions interpreted 393 CT images of patients with acute chest trauma, with and without AI software. The CT images were randomly split into two sets at each institution, with each set assigned to a different radiologist First, the detection of all fractures (AFs), including displaced fractures (DFs), non-displaced fractures and buckle fractures, was analyzed. Next, the DFs were selected for analysis. The sensitivity and specificity of the radiologist-only and radiologist-AI groups at the patient level were set as primary endpoints, and secondary endpoints were at the rib and lesion level.\nRegarding AFs, the sensitivity difference between the radiologist-AI group and the radiologist-only group were significant at different levels (patient-level: 26.20%; rib-level: 22.18%; lesion-level: 23.74%; P\u2009<\u20090.001). Regarding DFs, the sensitivity difference was 16.67%, 14.19%, and 16.16% at the patient, rib, and lesion levels, respectively (P\u2009<\u20090.001). No significant difference was found in the specificity between the two groups for AFs and DFs at the patient and rib levels (P\u2009>\u20090.05).\nAI software improved the sensitivity of RF detection on CT images for junior radiologists and reduced the reading time by approximately 1 min per patient without decreasing the specificity.", "To highlight and review the application of artificial intelligence (AI) in kidney stone disease (KSD) for diagnostics, predicting procedural outcomes, stone passage, and recurrence rates. The systematic review was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) checklist.\nThis review discusses the newer advancements in AI-driven management strategies, which holds great promise to provide an essential step for personalized patient care and improved decision making. AI has been used in all areas of KSD including diagnosis, for predicting treatment suitability and success, basic science, quality of life (QOL), and recurrence of stone disease. However, it is still a research-based tool and is not used universally in clinical practice. This could be due to a lack of data infrastructure needed to train the algorithms, wider applicability in all groups of patients, complexity of its use and cost involved with it. The constantly evolving literature and future research should focus more on QOL and the cost of KSD treatment and develop evidence-based AI algorithms that can be used universally, to guide urologists in the management of stone disease.", "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the sixth most common cancer in the world and the third leading cause of cancer-related death. Although the diagnostic scheme of HCC is currently undergoing refinement, the prognosis of HCC is still not satisfactory. In addition to certain factors, such as tumor size and number and vascular invasion displayed on traditional imaging, some histopathological features and gene expression parameters are also important for the prognosis of HCC patients. However, most parameters are based on postoperative pathological examinations, which cannot help with preoperative decision-making. As a new field, radiomics extracts high-throughput imaging data from different types of images to build models and predict clinical outcomes noninvasively before surgery, rendering it a powerful aid for making personalized treatment decisions preoperatively.\nThis study reviewed the workflow of radiomics and the research progress on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) radiomics in the diagnosis and treatment of HCC.\nA literature review was conducted by searching PubMed for search of relevant peer-reviewed articles published from May 2017 to June 2021.The search keywords included HCC, MRI, radiomics, deep learning, artificial intelligence, machine learning, neural network, texture analysis, diagnosis, histopathology, microvascular invasion, surgical resection, radiofrequency, recurrence, relapse, transarterial chemoembolization, targeted therapy, immunotherapy, therapeutic response, and prognosis.\nRadiomics features on MRI can be used as biomarkers to determine the differential diagnosis, histological grade, microvascular invasion status, gene expression status, local and systemic therapeutic responses, and prognosis of HCC patients.\nRadiomics is a promising new imaging method. MRI radiomics has high application value in the diagnosis and treatment of HCC.", "Digital twin (DT) and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies have grown rapidly in recent years and are considered by both academia and industry to be key enablers for Industry 4.0. As a digital replica of a physical entity, the basis of DT is the infrastructure and data, the core is the algorithm and model, and the application is the software and service. The grounding of DT and AI in industrial sectors is even more dependent on the systematic and in-depth integration of domain-specific expertise. This survey comprehensively reviews over 300 manuscripts on AI-driven DT technologies of Industry 4.0 used over the past five years and summarizes their general developments and the current state of AI-integration in the fields of smart manufacturing and advanced robotics. These cover conventional sophisticated metal machining and industrial automation as well as emerging techniques, such as 3D printing and human-robot interaction/cooperation. Furthermore, advantages of AI-driven DTs in the context of sustainable development are elaborated. Practical challenges and development prospects of AI-driven DTs are discussed with a respective focus on different levels. A route for AI-integration in multiscale/fidelity DTs with multiscale/fidelity data sources in Industry 4.0 is outlined.", "Flexible sensors have attracted great research interest due to their applications in artificial intelligence, wearable electronics, and personal health management. However, due to the inherent brittleness of common hydrogels, preparing a hydrogel-based sensor integrated with excellent flexibility, self-recovery, and antifatigue properties still remains a challenge to date. In this study, a type of physically and chemically dual-cross-linked conductive hydrogels based on 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl (TEMPO)-oxidized cellulose nanofiber (TOCN)-carrying carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and polyacrylamide (PAAM) matrix via a facial one-pot free-radical polymerization is developed for multifunctional wearable sensing application. Inside the hierarchical gel network, TOCNs not only serve as the nanoreinforcement with a toughening effect but also efficiently assist the homogeneous distribution of CNTs in the hydrogel matrix. The optimized TOCN-CNT/PAAM hydrogel integrates high compressive (\u223c2.55 MPa at 60% strain) and tensile (\u223c0.15 MPa) strength, excellent intrinsic self-recovery property (recovery efficiency >92%), and antifatigue capacity under both cyclic stretching and pressing. The multifunctional sensors assembled by the hydrogel exhibit both high strain sensitivity (gauge factor\u202f\u224811.8 at 100-200% strain) and good pressure sensing ability over a large pressure range (0-140 kPa), which can effectively detect the subtle and large-scale human motions through repeatable and stable electrical signals even after 100 loading-unloading cycles. The comprehensive performance of the TOCN-CNT/PAAM hydrogel-based sensor is superior to those of most gel-based sensors previously reported, indicating its potential applications in multifunctional sensing devices for healthcare systems and human motion monitoring.", "Using a new method for examining parental explanations in a laboratory setting, the prompted explanation task, this study examines how characteristics of parental explanations about biology relate to children's knowledge. Parents (N\u00a0=\u00a0148; Mage \u00a0=\u00a038; 84% female, 16% male; 67% having completed college) of children ages 7-10 (Mage \u00a0=\u00a08.92; 47% female, 53% male; 58% White, 9.5% Black, 9.5% Asian) provided answers to eight how and why questions about biology. Parents used a number of different approaches to address the questions, including providing more mechanistic responses to how questions and more teleological responses to why questions. The characteristics of parental explanations-most notably, how frequently parents provided correct responses-predicted children's performance on measures of verbal intelligence and biological knowledge. Additional exploratory analyses and implications for children's learning are discussed.", "Subjective Cognitive Decline (SCD) is a self-experienced decline in cognitive capacity with normal performance on standardized cognitive tests, showing to increase risk of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Cognitive reserve seems to influence the progression from SCD to Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and to AD. The aim of our study was to investigate gender differences in cognitive reserve evaluating how sex might modulate the role of cognitive reserve on SCD.\nWe included 381 SCD patients who underwent clinical evaluation, neuropsychological assessment, evaluation of premorbid intelligence by the Test di Intelligenza Breve (TIB), cognitive complaints by the Memory Assessment Clinics Questionnaire (MAC-Q), and apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotyping.\nThe proportion between women and men was significantly different (68.7% [95% CI 63.9-73.4 vs 31.4%, 95% CI 26.6-36.0]). Women were younger than men at onset of SCD and at the baseline visit (p\u2009=\u20090.021), had lower years of education (p\u2009=\u20090.007), lower TIB scores (p\u2009<\u20090.001), and higher MAC-Q scores (p\u2009=\u20090.012). TIB was directly associated with age at onset of SCD in both women and men, while years of education was inversely associated with age at onset only in women. Multivariate analysis showed that sex influences TIB independently from years of education. TIB was directly associated with MAC-Q in men.\nSex interacts with premorbid intelligence and education level in influencing the age at onset and the severity of SCD. As the effect of education was different between men and women, we speculated that education might act as a minor contributor of cognitive reserve in women.", "In this article, we focus on the role of artificial intelligence in the management of lung cancer. We summarized commonly used algorithms, current applications and challenges of artificial intelligence in lung cancer.\nFeature engineering for tabular data and computer vision for image data are commonly used algorithms in lung cancer research. Furthermore, the use of artificial intelligence in lung cancer has extended to the entire clinical pathway including screening, diagnosis and treatment. Lung cancer screening mainly focuses on two aspects: identifying high-risk populations and the automatic detection of lung nodules. Artificial intelligence diagnosis of lung cancer covers imaging diagnosis, pathological diagnosis and genetic diagnosis. The artificial intelligence clinical decision-support system is the main application of artificial intelligence in lung cancer treatment. Currently, the challenges of artificial intelligence applications in lung cancer mainly focus on the interpretability of artificial intelligence models and limited annotated datasets; and recent advances in explainable machine learning, transfer learning and federated learning might solve these problems.\nArtificial intelligence shows great potential in many aspects of the management of lung cancer, especially in screening and diagnosis. Future studies on interpretability and privacy are needed for further application of artificial intelligence in lung cancer.", "To investigate whether the dose planned for cardiac structures is associated with the risk of heart disease (HD) in patients with breast cancer treated with radiation therapy, and whether this association is modified by the presence of coronary artery calcification (CAC).\nRadiation therapy planning computed tomographic (CT) scans and corresponding dose distribution maps of 5561 patients were collected, 5300 patients remained after the exclusion of ineligible patients and duplicates; 1899 patients received their CT scan before 2011, allowing long follow-up. CAC was detected automatically. Using an artificial intelligence-based method, the cardiac structures (heart, cardiac chambers, large arteries, 3 main coronary arteries) were segmented. The planned radiation dose to each structure separately and to the whole heart were determined. Patients were assigned to a low-, medium-, or high-dose group based on the dose to the respective heart structure. Information on HD hospitalization and mortality was obtained for each patient. The association of planned radiation dose to cardiac structures with risk of HD was investigated in patients with and without CAC using Cox proportional hazard analysis in the long follow-up population. Tests for interaction were performed.\nAfter a median follow-up of 96.0 months (interquartile range, 84.2-110.4 months) in the long follow-up group, 135 patients were hospitalized for HD or died of HD. If the dose to a structure increased 1 Gy, the relative HD risk increased by 3% to 11%. The absolute increase in HD risk was substantially higher in patients with CAC (event-ratelow-dose\u202f=\u202f14-15 vs event-ratehigh-dose\u202f=\u202f15-34 per 1000 person-years) than in patients without CAC (event-ratelow-dose\u202f=\u202f6-8 vs event-ratehigh-dose\u202f=\u202f5-17 per 1000 person-years). No interaction between CAC and radiation dose was found.\nRadiation exposure of cardiac structures is associated with increased risk of HD. Automatic segmentation of cardiac structures enables spatially localized dose estimation, which can aid in the prevention of radiation therapy-induced cardiac damage. This could be especially valuable in patients with breast cancer and CAC.", "Microporous organic polymers (MOPs) are a new class of microporous materials. Due to their high porosity, large pore volume, and large surface area, MOPs exhibit excellent performance in gas adsorption and storage, membrane separation, ion capture, heterogeneous catalysis, light energy conversion and storage, capacitance, and other fields. However, selecting high-performance materials for specific applications from thousands of candidate MOPs is a key problem. Traditional design strategies for new materials with targeted properties, including trial-and-error and relying on the experiences of domain experts, are time- and cost-consuming. With the rapid development of computation technology and theoretical chemistry, the discovery of new materials is no longer a purely experimental subject. Breaking away from the traditional trial-and-error strategy for materials discovery, materials design is emerging and gaining increasing attention. In addition, the ability to collect \"big data\" has greatly improved and has further stimulated the development of new methods for materials design and discovery. In this perspective, we examine how data-driven techniques combine artificial intelligence (AI) and human expertise, playing a significant role in the design of MOPs. Such analytics can significantly reduce time-to-insight and accelerate the cost-effective materials discovery, which is the goal for designing future MOPs.", "We propose a novel polymorph of a hexagonal B3S monolayer by combing structure swarm intelligence and first-principles calculations. Phonon spectrum analysis and ab initio molecular dynamics simulation indicate that the new structure is dynamically and thermally stable. Furthermore, the structure is mechanically stable and has a satisfactory elastic modulus. Our results show that the B3S monolayer is a semiconductor with strong visible-light optical absorption. More importantly, the electronic properties of the structure are tunable via surface functionalization. For example, hydrogenation or fluorination could transform the monolayer from the semiconducting to metallic state. On the other hand, surface oxidation could significantly enhance both carrier mobility and near-infrared optical absorption. Furthermore, we also discovered that the monolayer possesses satisfactory storage capacity for H2.", "Cognitive impairment is a core feature of schizophrenia which precedes the onset of full psychotic symptoms, even in the ultra-high-risk stage (UHR). Polygenic risk scores (PRS) can be computed for many psychiatric disorders and phenotyping traits, including scores for resilience. We explored the correlations between several PRS and neurocognition in UHR individuals. We included 107 UHR individuals; 29.9% of them converted to psychosis (UHR-C) while 57.0% did not (UHR-NC) during the 1-year follow-up. Cognitive performances were assessed with the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale estimating the Intelligence Quotient (IQ), the Trail Making Test, the verbal fluency, the Stroop test, and the Wisconsin card sorting test. Linear regression models were used to test their association with the PRS for schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depression, ADHD, cross-disorders, cognitive performance, intelligence, education attainment, and resilience to schizophrenia. UHR-C had a lower IQ than UHR-NC. The PRS for schizophrenia negatively correlated with IQ, while the PRS for cognitive performance and for resilience positively correlated with IQ. PRS for schizophrenia showed a significant correlation with working memory and processing speed indices. PRS for schizophrenia showed a higher effect on IQ in UHR-NC, and UHR-NC with high PRS for schizophrenia had a similar IQ as UHR-C. Conversely, UHR-C with a high PRS for resilience performed as well as UHR-NC. Our findings suggest that cognitive deficits may predate the onset of psychosis. The genetic architecture of schizophrenia seems to impacts the cognition in UHR-NC. Cognition is also mediated by PRS for resilience.", "The purpose of this study was to investigate the dimensionality of the cognitive processes related to memory capacity and language ability and to assess the magnitude of the relationships among these processes in children developing typically (TD) and children with developmental language disorder (DLD). Participants were 234 children between the ages of 7;0 and 11;11 (117 TD and 117 DLD) who were propensity matched on age, sex, mother education and family income. Latent variables created from cognitive processing tasks and standardized measures of comprehension and production of lexical and sentential aspects of language were tested with confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and structural regression. A five-factor CFA model that included the constructs of Fluid Intelligence, Controlled Attention, Working Memory, Long-Term Memory for Language Knowledge and Language Ability yielded better fit statistics than two four-factor nested models. The four cognitive abilities accounted for more than 92% of the variance in the language measures. A structural regression model indicated that the relationship between working memory and language ability was significantly greater for the TD group than the DLD group. These results are consistent with a broad conceptualization of the nature of language impairment in older, school-age children as encompassing a dynamic system in which cognitive abilities account for nearly all of the variance in linguistic abilities.", "Cross-sectional and prospective studies have provided evidence of the neurotoxic effect of early exposure to fluoride (F) in pregnancy. It has been negatively associated with cognitive development during childhood, with most research conducted in areas with high F levels in community drinking water (CDW).\nData from 316 to 248 mother-child pairs from the Infancia y Medio Ambiente (Childhood and Environment, INMA) birth cohort project with maternal urinary F level adjusted for creatinine (MUFcr) measurements in the first and third trimesters of pregnancy. Children's cognitive domains and intelligence indexes were evaluated using the Bayley Scales (age of 1) and the McCarthy Scales (age of 4). Multiple linear regression analyses were carried out adjusting for a wide range of covariates related to the child, mother, family context and other potential neurotoxicants.\nNo association was found between MUFcr levels and Bayley Mental Development Index score. Nevertheless, regarding the McCarthy scales, it was found that per unit (mg/g) of MUFcr across the whole pregnancy, scores in boys were greater for the verbal, performance, numeric and memory domains (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a013.86, CI 95%: 3.91, 23.82), (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a05.86, CI 95%: 0.32, 11.39), (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a06.22, CI 95%: 0.65, 11.79) and (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a011.63, CI 95%: 2.62, 20.63) respectively and for General Cognitive Index (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a015.4, CI 95%: 6.32, 24.48). For girls there was not any cognitive score significantly associated with MUFcr, being the sex-F interactions significant (P interaction <0.05). Including other toxicants levels, quality of family context or deprivation index did not substantially change the results.\nIn boys, positive associations were observed between MUFcr and scores in cognitive domains at the age of 4. These findings are inconsistent with those from some previous studies and indicate the need for other population-based studies to confirm or overturn these results at low levels of F in CDW.", "Statistical water quality forecast models are useful tools to assist with beach management. In particular, multiple linear regression (MLR) models have been successfully developed for prediction of fecal indicator bacteria concentrations for beaches in river, lake, and marine environments. Nevertheless, an unresolved challenging issue is the reliable prediction of infrequent events of high bacterial concentrations to inform beach closure decisions to protect public health. The number of field data available for the infrequent events is typically an order of magnitude less than that for days when the water quality criterion is met-MLR models often perform poorly in predicting bacterial concentrations on days when the beaches should be closed. For beach management in Hong Kong, MLR models have been developed to predict beach water quality indices in terms of four gradings (BWQI-1 to 4) based on Escherichia coli (E. coli) concentrations. In this study, we propose an artificial intelligence (AI)-based binary classification (EasyEnsemble) model using class-imbalance learning to predict \"very poor\" occasions (BWQI-4)-when E. coli concentration exceeds 610 counts/100 mL. Models are developed for three marine beaches with different hydrographic and pollution characteristics using a 30 year data set spanning three periods with different water quality status. The model-data comparison over a wide range of conditions shows that the proposed method results in a significant improvement in the prediction of \"very poor\" water quality. The proposed class-imbalance method for predicting rare events has an F-score of 0.84, and it significantly outperforms MLR and classification tree (CT) models with corresponding F-scores of 0.39 and 0.69. A robust beach water quality forecast system can hence be developed using hybrid MLR-binary classification modeling.", "The rates of skin cancer (SC) are rising every year and becoming a critical health issue worldwide. SC's early and accurate diagnosis is the key procedure to reduce these rates and improve survivability. However, the manual diagnosis is exhausting, complicated, expensive, prone to diagnostic error, and highly dependent on the dermatologist's experience and abilities. Thus, there is a vital need to create automated dermatologist tools that are capable of accurately classifying SC subclasses. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) techniques including machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) have verified the success of computer-assisted dermatologist tools in the automatic diagnosis and detection of SC diseases. Previous AI-based dermatologist tools are based on features which are either high-level features based on DL methods or low-level features based on handcrafted operations. Most of them were constructed for binary classification of SC. This study proposes an intelligent dermatologist tool to accurately diagnose multiple skin lesions automatically. This tool incorporates manifold radiomics features categories involving high-level features such as ResNet-50, DenseNet-201, and DarkNet-53 and low-level features including discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and local binary pattern (LBP). The results of the proposed intelligent tool prove that merging manifold features of different categories has a high influence on the classification accuracy. Moreover, these results are superior to those obtained by other related AI-based dermatologist tools. Therefore, the proposed intelligent tool can be used by dermatologists to help them in the accurate diagnosis of the SC subcategory. It can also overcome manual diagnosis limitations, reduce the rates of infection, and enhance survival rates.", "The combination of education and artificial intelligence is the developmental direction of future educational systems. Through the participation of artificial intelligence, an educational system with sensibility and computer rationality can be created. Albeit the advantages and importance of this education system are beyond doubt, nevertheless, at present, the combination of artificial intelligence and education is still in its infancy. This is because the theoretical application, equipment research, and development are neither perfect nor up to the required standard. The research points out the reality that artificial intelligence technology has been widely used in sports and analyzes the specific application of artificial intelligence in sports. In this paper, the knowledge of artificial intelligence is combined with the physical training and teaching in colleges and universities, and an educational system is developed to guide teachers' and students' training, which improves the teaching quality and training efficiency.", "Due to the rapid development of artificial intelligence technology, industrial sectors are revolutionizing in automation, reliability, and robustness, thereby significantly increasing quality and productivity. Most of the surveillance and industrial sectors are monitored by visual sensor networks capturing different surrounding environment images. However, during tempestuous weather conditions, the visual quality of the images is reduced due to contaminated suspended atmospheric particles that affect the overall surveillance systems. To tackle these challenges, this article presents a computationally efficient lightweight convolutional neural network referred to as Light-DehazeNet (LD-Net) for the reconstruction of hazy images. Unlike other learning-based approaches, which separately measure the transmission map and the atmospheric light, our proposed LD-Net jointly estimates both the transmission map and the atmospheric light using a transformed atmospheric scattering model. Furthermore, a color visibility restoration method is proposed to evade the color distortion in the dehaze image. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments using synthetic and natural hazy images. The quantitative and qualitative evaluation on different benchmark hazy datasets verify the superiority of the proposed method over other state-of-the-art image dehazing techniques. Moreover, additional experimentation validates the applicability of the proposed method in the object detection tasks. Considering the lightweight architecture with minimal computational cost, the proposed system is encouraged to be incorporated as an integral part of the vision-based monitoring systems to improve the overall performance.", "Our understanding of chronic pain and the underlying molecular mechanisms remains limited due to a lack of tools to identify the complex phenomena responsible for exaggerated pain behaviours. Furthermore, currently there is no objective measure of pain with current assessment relying on patient self-scoring. Here, we applied a fully biologically unsupervised technique of hyperspectral autofluorescence imaging to identify a complex signature associated with chronic constriction nerve injury known to cause allodynia. The analysis was carried out using deep learning/artificial intelligence methods. The central element was a deep learning autoencoder we developed to condense the hyperspectral channel images into a four- colour image, such that spinal cord tissue based on nerve injury status could be differentiated from control tissue. This study provides the first validation of hyperspectral imaging as a tool to differentiate tissues from nerve injured vs non-injured mice. The auto-fluorescent signals associated with nerve injury were not diffuse throughout the tissue but formed specific microscopic size regions. Furthermore, we identified a unique fluorescent signal that could differentiate spinal cord tissue isolated from nerve injured male and female animals. The identification of a specific global autofluorescence fingerprint associated with nerve injury and resultant neuropathic pain opens up the exciting opportunity to develop a diagnostic tool for identifying novel contributors to pain in individuals.", "Over the last decade, there has been a huge demand for health care technologies such as sensors-based prediction using digital health. With the continuous rise in the human population, these technologies showed to be potentially effective solutions to life-threatening diseases such as heart failure (HF). Besides being a potential for early death, HF has a significantly reduced quality of life (QoL). Heart failure has no cure. However, treatment can help you live a longer and more active life with fewer symptoms. Thus, it is essential to develop technological aid solutions allowing early diagnosis and consequently, effective treatment with possibly delayed mortality. Commonly, forecasts of HF are based on the generation of vast volumes of data usually collected from an individual patient by different components of the family history, physical examination, basic laboratory results, and other medical records. Though, these data are not effectively useful for predicting this failure, nevertheless, with the aid of advanced medical technology such as interconnected multi-sensory-based devices, and based on several medical history characteristics, the broad data provided machine learning algorithms to predict risk factors for heart disease of an individual is beneficial. There will be many challenges for the next decade of advancements in HF care: exploiting an increasingly growing repertoire of interconnected internal and external sensors for the benefit of patients and processing large, multimodal datasets with new Artificial Intelligence (AI) software. Various methods for predicting heart failure and, primarily the significance of invasive and non-invasive sensors along with different strategies for machine learning to predict heart failure are presented and summarized in the present study.", "Individuals with schizophrenia exhibit deficits in visual contrast processing, though less is known about how these deficits impact neurocognition and functional outcomes. This study investigated effects of contrast sensitivity (CS) on cognition and capacity for independent living in schizophrenia.\nParticipants were 58 patients with schizophrenia (n\u00a0=\u00a049) and schizoaffective disorder (n\u00a0=\u00a09). Patients completed a psychophysical paradigm to obtain CS with stimuli consisting of grating patterns of low (0.5 and 1 cycles/degree) and high spatial frequencies (4, 7, 21 cycles/degree). Patients completed the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery and Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scales, Third Edition to assess cognition, and the problem-solving factor of the Independent Living Scales to assess functional capacity. We computed bivariate correlation coefficients for all pairs of variables and tested mediation models with CS to low (CS-LSF) and high spatial frequencies (CS-HSF) as predictors, cognitive measures as mediators, and capacity for independent living as an outcome.\nCognition mediated the relationship between CS and independent living with CS-LSF a stronger predictor than CS-HSF. Mediation effects were strongest for perceptual organization and memory-related domains. In an expanded moderated mediation model, CS-HSF was found to be a significant predictor of independent living through perceptual organization as a mediator and CS-LSF as a moderator of this relationship.\nCS relates to functional capacity in schizophrenia through neurocognition. These relationships may inform novel visual remediation interventions.", "A pair of studies demonstrates that simply asking children to make a blatantly false accusation in the guise of helping others can result in both immediate and long-term false claims. In the pilot study, the initial willingness to make a blatantly false statement was associated with some children making false statements a week later despite being told that the first interviewer had made mistakes during the initial interview. On a positive note, the majority of participants accurately stated that they did not have first-hand knowledge of their accusation's accuracy. Across both studies, the rate of false accusation rates was high. The main experiment demonstrated that children who were young, possessed the lowest verbal intelligence or who were from the lowest SES homes made the most accusations. These findings illustrate not only the dangers of encouraging children to make false statements, but the ease and durability of making such false statements.", "Diabetic foot ulcers, with worldwide prevalence ranging from 12%-25%, are an important cause of nontraumatic lower limb amputation. Evidence-based assessment of early infection can help the clinician provide the right first line treatment thus helping improve the wound closure rate. Illuminate\u00ae, a novel point of care device working on multispectral autofluorescence imaging, helps in the rapid identification and classification of bacteria. This study was aimed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of the device in detecting bacterial gram type against standard culture methods. A total of 178 patients from a tertiary care center for diabetes was recruited and 203 tissue samples were obtained from the wound base by the plastic surgeon. The device was handled by the trained investigator to take wound images. The tissue samples were taken from the color-coded infected region as indicated by the device's Artificial Intelligence algorithm and sent for microbial assessment. The results were compared against the Gram type inferred by the device and the device was found to have an accuracy of 89.54%, a positive predictive value of 86.27% for detecting Gram-positive bacteria, 80.77% for Gram-negative bacteria, and 91.67% for no infection. The negative predictive value corresponded to 87.25% for Gram-positive, 92% for Gram-negative, and 96.12% for no infection. The Results exhibited the accuracy of this novel autofluorescence device in identifying and classifying the gram type of bacteria and its potential in significantly aiding clinicians towards early infection assessment and treatment.", "Artificial intelligence is nowadays used for cell detection and classification in optical microscopy during post-acquisition analysis. The microscopes are now fully automated and next expected to be smart by making acquisition decisions based on the images. It calls for analysing them on the fly. Biology further imposes training on a reduced data set due to cost and time to prepare the samples and have the data sets annotated by experts. We propose a real-time image processing compliant with these specifications by balancing accurate detection and execution performance. We characterised the images using a generic, high-dimensional feature extractor. We then classified the images using machine learning to understand the contribution of each feature in decision and execution time. We found that the non-linear-classifier random forests outperformed Fisher's linear discriminant. More importantly, the most discriminant and time-consuming features could be excluded without significant accuracy loss, offering a substantial gain in execution time. It suggests a feature-group redundancy likely related to the biology of the observed cells. We offer a method to select fast and discriminant features. In our assay, a 79.6 \u00b1 2.4% accurate classification of a cell took 68.7 \u00b1 3.5 ms (mean \u00b1 SD, 5-fold cross-validation nested in 10 bootstrap repeats), corresponding to 14 cells per second, dispatched into eight phases of the cell cycle, using 12 feature groups and operating a consumer market ARM-based embedded system. A simple neural network offered similar performances paving the way to faster training and classification, using parallel execution on a general-purpose graphic processing unit. Finally, this strategy is also usable for deep neural networks paving the way to optimizing these algorithms for smart\u00a0microscopy.", "Develop and pilot an iPad-based intervention for improving visual-motor coordination, visual-spatial processing/reasoning, and visual attention in children with surgically treated hydrocephalus (HCP).\nWe developed an intervention protocol targeting visual-motor coordination, visual-spatial processing/reasoning, and visual attention. Fourteen participants with HCP completed 30\u00a0h of training over 6\u00a0weeks. The primary outcome measure was the Perceptual Reasoning Index from the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence, Second Edition. Secondary measures included subtests from the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, Fourth Edition, Developmental NEuroPSYchological Assessment, Second Edition (NEPSY-II), and Purdue Pegboard.\nChildren with HCP demonstrated gains with statistical significance on the Perceptual Reasoning Index. We also observed significant improvement on a timed test of visuo-motor coordination (Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, Fourth Edition, Coding).\nOur iPad-application-based intervention may promote visual-motor coordination, visual-spatial processing/reasoning, and visual attention skills in children with HCP, offering an engaging and economical supplement to more conventional therapies.", "With the rapid development of artificial intelligence and neural network computing, the requirement for information storage in computing is gradually increasing. Floating gate memories based on 2D materials has outstanding characteristics such as non-volatility, optical writing, and optical storage, suitable for application in photonic in-memory computing chips. Notably, the optoelectronic memory requires less optical writing energy, which means lower power consumption and greater storage levels. Here, the authors report an optoelectronic memory based on SnS2 /h-BN/graphene heterostructure with an extremely low photo-generated hole tunneling barrier of 0.23\u00a0eV. This non-volatile multibit floating gate memory shows a high switching ratio of 106 and a large memory window range of 64.8\u00a0V in the gate range \u00b140\u00a0V.\u00a0And the memory device can achieve multilevel storage states of 50 under a low power light pulses of 0.32\u00a0nW and small light pulse width of 50\u00a0ms. Thanks to the Fowler-Nordheim tunneling of the photo-generated holes, the optical writing energy of the optoelectronic memory has been successfully reduced by one to three orders of magnitude compared to existing 2D materials-based systems.", "The range of technologies currently used in biodiversity conservation is staggering, with innovative uses often adopted from other disciplines and being trialed in the field. We provide the first comprehensive overview of the current (2020) landscape of conservation technology, encompassing technologies for monitoring wildlife and habitats, as well as for on-the-ground conservation management (e.g., fighting illegal activities). We cover both established technologies (routinely deployed in conservation, backed by substantial field experience and scientific literature) and novel technologies or technology applications (typically at trial stage, only recently used in conservation), providing examples of conservation applications for both types. We describe technologies that deploy sensors that are fixed or portable, attached to vehicles (terrestrial, aquatic, or airborne) or to animals (biologging), complemented with a section on wildlife tracking. The last two sections cover actuators and computing (including web platforms, algorithms, and artificial intelligence).", "Here, we report the implementation and application of a simple, structure-aware framework to generate target-specific screening libraries. Our approach combines advances in generative artificial intelligence (AI) with conventional molecular docking to explore chemical space conditioned on the unique physicochemical properties of the active site of a biomolecular target. As a demonstration, we used our framework, which we refer to as sample-and-dock, to construct focused libraries for cyclin-dependent kinase type-2 (CDK2) and the active site of the main protease (Mpro) of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. We envision that the sample-and-dock framework could be used to generate theoretical maps of the chemical space specific to a given target and so provide information about its molecular recognition characteristics.", "Radiology is at the forefront of the artificial intelligence transformation of health care across multiple areas, from patient selection to study acquisition to image interpretation. Needing large data sets to develop and train these algorithms, developers enter contractual data sharing agreements involving data derived from health records, usually with postacquisition curation and annotation. In 2019 the ACR convened a Data Sharing Workgroup to develop philosophies around best practices in the sharing of health information. The workgroup identified five broad domains of activity important to collaboration using patient data: privacy, informed consent, standardization of data elements, vendor contracts, and data valuation. This is Part 1 of a Report on the workgroup's efforts in exploring these issues.", "Previous studies testing associations between polygenic risk for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD-PGR) and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures have been limited by small samples and inconsistent consideration of potential confounders. This study investigates whether higher LOAD-PGR is associated with differences in structural brain imaging and cognitive values in a relatively large sample of non-demented, generally healthy adults (UK Biobank). Summary statistics were used to create PGR scores for n\u2009=\u200932,790 participants using LDpred. Outcomes included 12 structural MRI volumes and 6 concurrent cognitive measures. Models were adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, genotyping chip, 8 genetic principal components, lifetime smoking, apolipoprotein (APOE) e4 genotype and socioeconomic deprivation. We tested for statistical interactions between APOE e4 allele dose and LOAD-PGR vs. all outcomes. In fully adjusted models, LOAD-PGR was associated with worse fluid intelligence (standardised beta [\u03b2]\u2009=\u2009-0.080 per LOAD-PGR standard deviation, p\u2009=\u20090.002), matrix completion (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009-0.102, p\u2009=\u20090.003), smaller left hippocampal total (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009-0.118, p\u2009=\u20090.002) and body (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009-0.069, p\u2009=\u20090.002) volumes, but not other hippocampal subdivisions. There were no significant APOE x LOAD-PGR score interactions for any outcomes in fully adjusted models. This is the largest study to date investigating LOAD-PGR and non-demented structural brain MRI and cognition phenotypes. LOAD-PGR was associated with smaller hippocampal volumes and aspects of cognitive ability in healthy adults and could supplement APOE status in risk stratification of cognitive impairment/LOAD.", "The patient monitors were used to explore the alarm actuality in a ICU and NICU to investigate the awareness and reaction of medical staff to alarms.\nA series of surveys and interviews were taken to acquire clinicians' feelings and attitudes to monitoring alarms. The researchers were scheduled to track the alarms with annotations, and collect the alarm data of patient monitors using central monitoring system.\nA total of 235 387 and 67 783 alarms occurred in ICU and NICU respectively. The average alarm rate was about 142 alarms/patient-day in ICU and 96 alarms/patient-day in NICU.\nThere remains alarm fatigue in ICU and NICU, the main reason is the large number of false alarms and clinically irrelevant alarms. In addition, patient monitor is still in the level of threshold alarms or combined alarms, the data integrity and intelligence level need to be improved in future.", "Over the past decade, artificial intelligence (AI) has contributed substantially to the resolution of various medical problems, including cancer. Deep learning (DL), a subfield of AI, is characterized by its ability to perform automated feature extraction and has great power in the assimilation and evaluation of large amounts of complicated data. On the basis of a large quantity of medical data and novel computational technologies, AI, especially DL, has been applied in various aspects of oncology research and has the potential to enhance cancer diagnosis and treatment. These applications range from early cancer detection, diagnosis, classification and grading, molecular characterization of tumors, prediction of patient outcomes and treatment responses, personalized treatment, automatic radiotherapy workflows, novel anti-cancer drug discovery, and clinical trials. In this review, we introduced the general principle of AI, summarized major areas of its application for cancer diagnosis and treatment, and discussed its future directions and remaining challenges. As the adoption of AI in clinical use is increasing, we anticipate the arrival of AI-powered cancer care.", "Machine learning (ML) is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables the analysis of complex multivariate data. ML has significant potential in risk assessments of non-target insects for modeling the multiple factors affecting insect health, including the adverse effects of agrochemicals. Here, the potential of ML for risk assessments of glyphosate (herbicide; formulation) and imidacloprid (insecticide, neonicotinoid; formulation) on the stingless bee Melipona quadrifasciata was explored. The collective behavior of forager bees was analyzed after in vitro exposure to agrochemicals. ML algorithms were applied to identify the agrochemicals that the bees have been exposed to based on multivariate behavioral features. Changes in the in situ detection of different proteins in the midgut were also studied. Imidacloprid exposure leads to the greatest changes in behavior. The ML algorithms achieved a higher accuracy (up to 91%) in identifying agrochemical contamination. The two agrochemicals altered the detection of cells positive for different proteins, which can be detrimental to midgut physiology. This study provides a holistic assessment of the sublethal effects of glyphosate and imidacloprid on a key pollinator. The procedures used here can be applied in future studies to monitor and predict multiple environmental factors affecting insect health in the field.", "Modern imaging procedures, including CT and MR diagnostics, play a significant role in recognizing, characterizing, determining the extent of pancreatic tumor lesions, assessing their operability, and evaluating response to treatment and patient follow-up. This article reviews the conventional imaging modalities used in the modern diagnosis of pancreatic tumors, conventional and contrast-enhanced abdominal ultrasound, standard protocols using the latest research results from CT and MRI scans, and their location and diagnostic value in the treatment of solid and cystic neoplasia. In addition, it briefly discusses the additional possibilities of artificial intelligence-based processing of digital imaging data, which is under strong development and is expected to be incorporated into clinical practice in the future.", "Can diversity make for better science? Although diversity has ethical and political value, arguments for its epistemic value require a bridge between normative and mechanistic considerations, demonstrating why and how diversity bene\ufb01ts collective intelligence. However, a major hurdle is that the bene\ufb01ts themselves are rather mixed: Quantitative evidence from psychology and behavioral sciences sometimes shows a positive epistemic effect of diversity, but often shows a null effect, or even a negative effect. Here we argue that to make progress with these why and how questions, we need \ufb01rst to rethink when one ought to expect a bene\ufb01t of cognitive diversity. In doing so, we highlight that the bene\ufb01ts of cognitive diversity are not equally distributed about collective intelligence tasks and are best seen for complex, multistage, creative problem solving, during problem posing and hypothesis generation. Throughout, we additionally outline a series of mechanisms relating diversity and problem complexity, and show how this perspective can inform metascience questions.", "Recently, increasing attention has been paid to the application of artificial intelligence (AI) to the diagnosis of diverse hepatic diseases, which comprises traditional machine learning and deep learning. Recent studies have shown the possible value of AI based data mining in predicting the incidence of hepatitis, classifying the different stages of hepatitis, diagnosing or screening for hepatitis, forecasting the progression of hepatitis, and predicting response to antiviral drugs in chronic hepatitis C patients. More importantly, AI based on radiology has been proven to be useful in predicting hepatitis and liver fibrosis as well as grading hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and differentiating it from benign liver tumors. It can predict the risk of vascular invasion of HCC, the risk of hepatic encephalopathy secondary to hepatitis B related cirrhosis, and the risk of liver failure after hepatectomy in HCC patients. In this review, we summarize the application of AI in hepatitis, and identify the challenges and future perspectives.", "Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has been ferociously destroying global health and economics. According to World Health Organisation (WHO), until May 2021, more than one hundred million infected cases and 3.2 million deaths have been reported in over 200 countries. Unfortunately, the numbers are still on the rise. Therefore, scientists are making a significant effort in researching accurate, efficient diagnoses. Several studies advocating artificial intelligence proposed COVID diagnosis methods on lung images with high accuracy. Furthermore, some affected areas in the lung images can be detected accurately by segmentation methods. This work has considered state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Network architectures, combined with the Unet family and Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) for COVID segmentation tasks on Computed Tomography (CT) scanner samples from the Italian Society of Medical and Interventional Radiology dataset. The experiments show that the decoder-based Unet family has reached the best (a mean Intersection Over Union (mIoU) of 0.9234, 0.9032 in dice score, and a recall of 0.9349) with a combination between SE ResNeXt and Unet++. The decoder with the Unet family obtained better COVID segmentation performance in comparison with Feature Pyramid Network. Furthermore, the proposed method outperforms recent segmentation state-of-the-art approaches such as the SegNet-based network, ADID-UNET, and A-SegNet + FTL. Therefore, it is expected to provide good segmentation visualizations of medical images.", "Proper diagnosis of Low Back Pain (LBP) is quite challenging in especially the developing countries like India. Though some developed countries prepared guidelines for evaluation of LBP with tests to detect psychological overlay, implementation of the recommendations becomes quite difficult in regular clinical practice, and different specialties of medicine offer different modes of management. Aiming at offering an expert-level diagnosis for the patients having LBP, this paper uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) to derive a clinically justified and highly sensitive LBP resolution technique.\nThe paper considers exhaustive knowledge for different LBP disorders (classified based on different pain generators), which have been represented using lattice structures to ensure completeness, non-redundancy, and optimality in the design of knowledge base. Further the representational enhancement of the knowledge has been done through construction of a hierarchical network, called RuleNet, using the concept of partially-ordered set (poset) with respect to the subset equality (\u2286) relation. With implicit incorporation of probability within the knowledge, the RuleNet is used to derive reliable resolution logic along with effective resolution of uncertainties during clinical decision making.\nThe proposed methodology has been validated with clinical records of seventy seven LBP patients accessed from the database of ESI Hospital Sealdah, India over a period of one year from 2018 to 2019. Achieving 83% sensitivity of the proposed technique, the pain experts at the hospital find the design clinically satisfactory. The inferred outcomes have also been found to be homogeneous with the actual or original diagnosis.\nThe proposed approach achieves the clinical and computational efficiency by limiting the shortcomings of the existing methodologies for AI-based LBP diagnosis. While computational efficiency (with respect to both time and space complexity) is ensured by inferring clinical decisions through optimal processing of the knowledge items using poset, the clinical acceptability has been ascertained reaching to the most-likely diagnostic outcomes through probabilistic resolution of clinical uncertainties.\nThe derived resolution technique, when embedded in LBP medical expert systems, would provide a fast, reliable, and affordable healthcare solution for this ailment to a wider range of general population suffering from LBP. The proposed scheme would significantly reduce the controversies and confusion in LBP treatment, and cut down the cost of unnecessary or inappropriate treatment and referral.", "This paper presents a novel philosophical analysis of the problem of law enforcement's use of biased face recognition technology (FRT) in liberal democracies. FRT programs used by law enforcement in identifying crime suspects are substantially more error-prone on facial images depicting darker skin tones and females as compared to facial images depicting Caucasian males. This bias can lead to citizens being wrongfully investigated by police along racial and gender lines. The author develops and defends \"A Liberal Argument Against Biased FRT,\" which concludes that law enforcement use of biased FRT is inconsistent with the classical liberal requirement that government treat all citizens equally before the law. Two objections to this argument are considered and shown to be unsound. The author concludes by suggesting that equality before the law should be preserved while the problem of machine bias ought to be resolved before FRT and other types of artificial intelligence (AI) are deployed by governments in liberal democracies.", "Traditional pathology approaches have played an integral role in the delivery of diagnosis, semi-quantitative or qualitative assessment of protein expression, and classification of disease. Technological advances and the increased focus on precision medicine have recently paved the way for the development of digital pathology-based approaches for quantitative pathologic assessments, namely whole slide imaging and artificial intelligence (AI)-based solutions, allowing us to explore and extract information beyond human visual perception. Within the field of immuno-oncology, the application of such methodologies in drug development and translational research have created invaluable opportunities for deciphering complex pathophysiology and the discovery of novel biomarkers and drug targets. With an increasing number of treatment options available for any given disease, practitioners face the growing challenge of selecting the most appropriate treatment for each patient. The ever-increasing utilization of AI-based approaches substantially expands our understanding of the tumor microenvironment, with digital approaches to patient stratification and selection for diagnostic assays supporting the identification of the optimal treatment regimen based on patient profiles. This review provides an overview of the opportunities and limitations around implementing AI-based methods in biomarker discovery and patient selection and discusses how advances in digital pathology and AI should be considered in the current landscape of translational medicine, touching on challenges this technology may face if adopted in clinical settings. The traditional role of pathologists in delivering accurate diagnoses or assessing biomarkers for companion diagnostics may be enhanced in precision, reproducibility, and scale by AI-powered analysis tools.", "High intelligence (IQ) adults with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) often perform better on neuropsychological tests relative to average IQ adults with ADHD, despite commensurate functional impairment. This study compared adults with ADHD and high versus average IQ on the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT) to specifically assess this proposed masking effect of IQ on verbal learning/memory performance among those undergoing neuropsychological evaluation.\nRAVLT performance between patients with ADHD and average versus high Test of Premorbid Function-estimated IQ were compared. Latent growth curve modeling (LGCM) evaluated learning acquisition across trials.\nRAVLT total learning, immediate, and delayed free recall performances were significantly better in the high IQ relative to the average IQ group. LGCM showed similar quadradic growth trajectories for both IQ groups. Both groups reported equivalent symptom severity and functional complaints in childhood and adulthood.\nAdults with ADHD and high IQ performed normally on a verbal learning/memory test compared to adults with average IQ, who scored 0.5-1.0 standard deviations below the mean. These results suggest a masking of performance-based memory deficits in the context of higher IQ in adults with ADHD, supporting growing evidence that higher IQ masks neurocognitive deficits during the assessment of adults with ADHD.", "With the advent of artificial intelligence, computer-aided instruction has developed into intelligent computer-aided instruction. Computer-aided instruction not only overcomes many weaknesses of traditional physical education teaching but also significantly increases the teaching effect and efficiency. This article first studies and analyzes the characteristics of computer-aided instruction systems. Then, we use statistical methods and logical analysis to randomly select two classes of undergraduate students as the experimental and control group, respectively. In the control group, the traditional teaching model was adopted, while the experimental group adopted the computer-aided teaching mode. The experimental group showed significant improvement in physical education as compared to the control group. The results of this study validated that the use of computer-assisted instruction is beneficial in the implementation of physical education programs, mostly in teaching concepts and principles of academic nature.", "The study examined the relationships among emotional and meta-emotional intelligence, well-being, and sociometric status in 105 pre-adolescents. Emotional and meta-emotional intelligence were measured using the Intelligenza Emotiva: Abilit\u00e0, Credenze e Concetto di S\u00e9 Meta-Emotivo (IE-ACCME) test (D'Amico, 2013), allowing to measure ability emotional intelligence (EI), emotional self-concept, meta-emotional knowledge, meta-emotional ability in self-evaluation, and meta-emotional beliefs. Meta-emotional dimensions refer to the awareness of individuals about their emotional abilities and to their beliefs about the functioning of emotions in everyday life. Eudemonic well-being and sociometric status were, respectively, measured using the well-known Psychological Well-Being (PWB) scale by Ryff's (1989) and registering the levels of acceptance/rejection from peers (Moreno, 1960). Results demonstrated that: pre-adolescents' meta-emotional beliefs are positively associated to eudemonic well-being: pre-adolescents with higher levels of ability EI, meta-emotional knowledge and meta-emotional self-evaluation are more accepted by others while those that overestimate their emotional abilities are more refused by peers. These results evidence that meta-emotional variables may play a crucial role in well-being and sociometric status, encouraging future studies on this issue.", "With the acceleration of people's life rhythm, obstructive sleep apnea syndrome appears more and more frequently. This research mainly discusses the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome with a positive pressure ventilator based on artificial intelligence processor. The information storage function of the smart positive pressure ventilator is included in the local medical terminal, presented after logging in with the user authority. It is mainly composed of data collection, data processing, and medical interface design, which embeds data request, data transmission, data analysis, and detailed tasks such as data compression and storage, and functions such as data display, image drawing, and alarm notification are realized by the medical interface. When the CPAP ventilator transmits respiratory data to the local medical terminal, it sends real-time respiratory information data packets. The data packet is collected and sent in real time in a fixed period and then received and analyzed by the local medical terminal. In the CPAP ventilator telemedicine system, the function of alarm message processing is mainly used to detect the patient's breathing status in real time, extract the alarm-related information, and generate an alarm. This function specifically includes several tasks such as alarm detection, alarm prompt, alarm storage, and remote transmission of alarm messages. The confirmed OSAS patients were pressure-titrated with a smart CPAP ventilator and then treated for 5 hours a day, followed by echocardiography after 5 months of continuous treatment. During the study, the average BMI was (28.9\u2009\u00b1\u20097.2)\u2009kg/m2 and the average AHI index was (53.1\u2009\u00b1\u200937.8) times/h. This study may help improve the quality of life of patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome.", "Advances in High-performance computing (HPC) technology have reached the capacity to inform cardiovascular (CV) science in the realm of both inductive and constructive approaches. Clinical trials allow for the comparison of the effect of an intervention without the need to understand the mechanism. This is a typical example of an inductive approach. In the HPC field, training an artificial intelligence (AI) model, constructed by neural networks, to predict future CV events with the use of large scale multi-dimensional datasets is the counterpart that may rely on as well as inform understanding of mechanistic underpinnings for optimization. However, in contrast to clinical trials, AI can calculate event risk at the individual level and has the potential to inform and refine the application of personalized medicine.Despite this clear strength, results from AI analyses may identify otherwise unidentified/unexpected (i.e. non-intuitive) relationships between multi-dimensional data and clinical outcomes that may further unravel potential mechanistic pathways and identify potential therapeutic targets, therebycontributing to the parsing of observational associations from causal links. The constructive approach will remain critical to overcome limitations of existing knowledge and anchored biases to actualize a more sophisticated understanding of the complex pathobiology of CV diseases.HPC technology has the potential to underpin this constructive approach in CV basic and clinical science. In general, even complex biological phenomena can be reduced to combinations of simple biological/chemical/physical laws. In the deductive approach, the focus/intent is to explain complex CV diseases by combinations of simple principles.", "Graph models of the brain hold great promise as a framework to study functional and structural brain connectivity across scales and species. The network-based statistic (NBS) is a well-known tool for performing statistical inference on brain graphs, which controls the family-wise error rate in a mass univariate analysis by combining the cluster-based permutation technique and the graph-theoretical concept of connected components. As the NBS is based on group-level inference statistics, it does not inherently enable informed decisions at the level of individuals, which is, however, necessary for the realm of precision medicine. Here we introduce NBS-Predict, a new approach that combines the powerful features of machine learning (ML) and the NBS in a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI). By combining ML models with connected components in a cross-validation (CV) structure, the new methodology provides a fast and convenient tool to identify generalizable neuroimaging-based biomarkers. The purpose of this paper is to (i) introduce NBS-Predict and evaluate its performance using two sets of simulated data with known ground truths, (ii) demonstrate the application of NBS-Predict in a real case-control study, including resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) data acquired from patients with schizophrenia, (iii) evaluate NBS-Predict using rs-fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project 1200 subjects release. We found that: (i) NBS-Predict achieved good statistical power on two sets of simulated data; (ii) NBS-Predict classified schizophrenia with an accuracy of 90% using subjects' functional connectivity matrices and identified a subnetwork with reduced connections in the group with schizophrenia, mainly comprising brain regions localized in frontotemporal, visual, and motor areas, as well as in the subcortex; (iii) NBS-Predict also predicted general intelligence scores from resting-state fMRI connectivity matrices with a prediction score of r\u00a0=\u00a00.2 and identified a large-scale subnetwork associated with general intelligence. Overall results showed that NBS-Predict performed comparable to or better than pre-existing feature selection algorithms (lasso, elastic net, top 5%, p-value thresholding) and connectome-based predictive modeling (CPM) in terms of identifying relevant features and prediction accuracy.", "To study the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on the performance of mammogram with regard to the classification of the detected breast lesions in correlation to ultrasound-aided mammograms.\nEthics committee approval was obtained in this prospective analysis. The study included 2000 mammograms. The mammograms were interpreted by the radiologists and breast ultrasound was performed for all cases. The Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) score was applied regarding the combined evaluation of the mammogram and the ultrasound modalities. Each breast side was individually assessed with the aid of AI scanning in the form of targeted heat-map and then, a probability of malignancy (abnormality scoring percentage) was obtained. Operative and the histopathology data were the standard of reference.\nNormal assigned cases (BI-RADS 1) with no lesions were excluded from the statistical evaluation. The study included 538 benign and 642 malignant breast lesions (n = 1180, 59%). BI-RADS categories for the breast lesions with regard to the combined evaluation of the digital mammogram and ultrasound were assigned BI-RADS 2 (Benign) in 385 lesions with AI median value of the abnormality scoring percentage of 10 (n = 385/1180, 32.6%), and BI-RADS 5 (malignant) in 471, that had showed median percentage AI value of 88 (n = 471/1180, 39.9%). AI abnormality scoring of 59% yielded a sensitivity of 96.8% and specificity of 90.1% in the discrimination of the breast lesions detected on the included mammograms.\nAI could be considered as an optional primary reliable complementary tool to the digital mammogram for the evaluation of the breast lesions. The color hue and the abnormality scoring percentage presented a credible method for the detection and discrimination of breast cancer of near accuracy to the breast ultrasound. So consequently, AI- mammogram combination could be used as a one setting method to discriminate between cases that require further imaging or biopsy from those that need only time interval follows up.\nRecently, the indulgence of AI in the work-up of breast cancer was concerned. AI noted as a screening strategy for the detection of breast cancer. In the current work, the performance of AI was studied with regard to the diagnosis not just the detection of breast cancer in the mammographic-detected breast lesions. The evaluation was concerned with AI as a possible complementary reading tool to mammogram and included the qualitative assessment of the color hue and the quantitative integration of the abnormality scoring percentage.", "The aim of this study was to examine trends in the intended users and functionalities advertised by menstrual tracking apps to identify gaps in personas and intended needs fulfilled by these technologies.\nTwo types of materials were collected: a corpus of scientific articles related to the identities and needs of menstruators and a corpus of images and descriptions of menstrual tracking apps collected from the Google and Apple app stores. We conducted a scoping review of the literature to develop themes and then applied these as a framework to analyze the app corpus, looking for alignments and misalignments between the 2 corpora.\nA review of the literature showed a wide range of disciplines publishing work relevant to menstruators. We identified 2 broad themes: \"who are menstruators?\" and \"what are the needs of menstruators?\" Descriptions of menstrual trackers exhibited misalignments with these themes, with narrow characterizations of menstruators and design for limited needs.\nWe synthesize gaps in the design of menstrual tracking apps and discuss implications for designing around: (1) an irregular menstrual cycle as the norm; (2) the embodied, leaky experience of menstruation; and (3) the varied biologies, identities, and goals of menstruators. An overarching gap suggests a need for a human-centered artificial intelligence approach for model and data provenance, transparency and explanations of uncertainties, and the prioritization of privacy in menstrual trackers.\nComparing and contrasting literature about menstruators and descriptions of menstrual tracking apps provide a valuable guide to assess menstrual technology and their responsiveness to users and their needs.", "Outcomes of clinical trials need to be communicated effectively to make decisions that save lives. We investigated whether framing can bias these decisions and if risk preferences shift depending on the number of patients. Hypothetical information about two medicines used in clinical trials having a sure or a risky outcome was presented in either a gain frame (people would be saved) or a loss frame (people would die). The number of patients who signed up for the clinical trials was manipulated in both frames in all the experiments. Using an unnamed disease, lay participants (experiment 1) and would-be medical professionals (experiment 2) were asked to choose which medicine they would have administered. For COVID-19, lay participants were asked which medicine should medical professionals (experiment 3), artificially intelligent software (experiment 4), and they themselves (experiment 5) favour to be administered. Broadly consistent with prospect theory, people were more risk-seeking in the loss frames than the gain frames. However, risk-aversion in gain frames was sensitive to the number of lives with risk-neutrality at low magnitudes and risk-aversion at high magnitudes. In the loss frame, participants were mostly risk-seeking. This pattern was consistent across laypersons and medical professionals, further extended to preferences for choices that medical professionals and artificial intelligence programmes should make in the context of COVID-19. These results underscore how medical decisions can be impacted by the number of lives at stake while revealing inconsistent risk preferences for clinical trials during a real pandemic.", "Epidermal three-dimensional (3D) topography/quantification has not been completely characterized yet. The recently developed line-field confocal optical coherence tomography (LC-OCT) provides real-time, high-resolution, in-vivo 3D imaging of the skin. This pilot study aimed at quantifying epidermal metrics (epidermal thicknesses, dermal-epidermal junction [DEJ] undulation and keratinocyte number/shape/size) using 3D LC-OCT. For each study participant (8 female, skin-type-II, younger/older volunteers), seven body sites were imaged with LC-OCT. Epidermal metrics were calculated by segmentations and measurements assisted by artificial intelligence (AI) when appropriate. Thicknesses of epidermis/SC, DEJ undulation and keratinocyte nuclei volume varied across body sites. Evidence of keratinocyte maturation was observed in vivo: keratinocyte nuclei being small/spherical near the DEJ and flatter/elliptical near the skin surface. Skin microanatomy can be quantified by combining LC-OCT and AI. This technology could be highly relevant to understand aging processes and conditions linked to epidermal disorders. Future clinical/research applications are to be expected in this scenario.", "Prevalence for knee osteoarthritis is rising in both Sweden and globally due to increased age and obesity in the population. This has subsequently led to an increasing demand for knee arthroplasties. Correct diagnosis and classification of a knee osteoarthritis (OA) are therefore of a great interest in following-up and planning for either conservative or operative management. Most orthopedic surgeons rely on standard weight bearing radiographs of the knee. Improving the reliability and reproducibility of these interpretations could thus be hugely beneficial. Recently, deep learning which is a form of artificial intelligence (AI), has been showing promising results in interpreting radiographic images. In this study, we aim to evaluate how well an AI can classify the severity of knee OA, using entire image series and not excluding common visual disturbances such as an implant, cast and non-degenerative pathologies.\nWe selected 6103 radiographic exams of the knee taken at Danderyd University Hospital between the years 2002-2016 and manually categorized them according to the Kellgren & Lawrence grading scale (KL). We then trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) of ResNet architecture using PyTorch. We evaluated the results against a test set of 300 exams that had been reviewed independently by two senior orthopedic surgeons who settled eventual interobserver disagreements through consensus sessions.\nThe CNN yielded an overall AUC of more than 0.87 for all KL grades except KL grade 2, which yielded an AUC of 0.8 and a mean AUC of 0.92. When merging adjacent KL grades, all but one group showed near perfect results with AUC\u2009>\u20090.95 indicating excellent performance.\nWe have found that we could teach a CNN to correctly diagnose and classify the severity of knee OA using the KL grading system without cleaning the input data from major visual disturbances such as implants and other pathologies.", "As an ongoing public health menace, the novel coronavirus pandemic has challenged the world. With several mutations and a high transmission rate, the virus is able to infect individuals in an exponential manner. At the same time, Iran is confronted with multiple wave peaks and the health care system is facing a major challenge. In consequence, developing a robust forecasting methodology can assist health authorities for effective planning. In that regard, with the help of Artificial Neural Network-Artificial Bee Colony (ANN-ABC) and Artificial Neural Network- Firefly Algorithm (ANN-FA) as two robust hybrid artificial intelligence-based models, the current study intends to select the optimal model with the maximum accuracy rate. To do so, first a sample of COVID-19 confirmed cases in Iran ranging from 19 February 2020 to 25 July 2021 is compiled. 75% (25%) of total observation is randomly allocated as training (testing) data. Afterwards, an ANN model is trained with Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. Accordingly, based on R-squared and root-mean-square error criteria, the optimal number of hidden neurons is computed as 17. The proposed ANN model is employed to develop ANN-ABC and ANN-FA models for achieving the maximum accuracy rate. According to ANN-ABC, the R- squared values of the optimal model are 0.9884 and 0.9885 at train and test stages. In respect to ANN-FA, the R-squared ranged from 0.9954 to 0.9940 at the train and test phases, which indicates the outperformance of ANN-FA for predicting COVID-19 new cases in Iran. Finally, the proposed ANN-ABC and ANN-FA are applied for simulating the COVID-19 new cases data in different countries. The results revealed that both models can be used as a robust predictor of COVID-19 data and in a majority of cases ANN-FA outperforms the ANN-ABC.", "Our understanding of the fundamental cellular and molecular factors leading to atrial fibrillation (AF) remains stagnant despite significant advancement in ablation and device technologies. Diagnosis and prevention strategies fall behind that of treatment, but expanding knowledge in AF genetics holds the potential to drive progress. We aim to review how an understanding of the genetic contributions to AF can guide an approach to individualized risk stratification and novel avenues in drug discovery.\nRare familial forms of AF identified monogenic contributions to the development of AF. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) further identified single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) suggesting polygenic and multiplex nature of this common disease. Polygenic risk scores accounting for the multitude of associated SNPs that each confer mildly elevated risk have been developed to translate genetic information into clinical practice, though shortcomings remain. Additionally, novel laboratory methods have been empowered by recent genetic findings to enhance drug discovery efforts. AF is increasingly recognized as a disease with a significant genetic component. With expanding sequencing technologies and accessibility, polygenic risk scores can help identify high risk individuals. Advancement in digital health tools, artificial intelligence and machine learning based on standard electrocardiograms, and genomic driven drug discovery may be integrated to deliver a sophisticated level of precision medicine in this modern era of emphasis on prevention. Randomized, prospective studies to demonstrate clinical benefits of these available tools are needed to validate this approach.", "The psychologist Isabelle Kendig had two careers before earning her doctorate and rising to the position of chief psychologist at St. Elizabeths Hospital in Washington, DC. She began as a eugenic field worker in 1912, focusing on Shutesbury, Massachusetts, where she administered intelligence tests to the locals, collected gossip about their character, and created genealogical charts. When she presented her research to Charles Davenport and other social scientists concerned with social defect, Kendig dissented from eugenics orthodoxy. She was shunned by Davenport, who, in turn, falsified her findings to fit his beliefs. She was then hired by Massachusetts and New Hampshire to survey intellectual disability in each state. Following her work in eugenics, Kendig was briefly a leading figure in feminist and antimilitarist campaigns, including the National Women's Party and the 1924 presidential campaign of Senator Robert La Follette. In 1933, she earned a PhD in clinical psychology from Radcliffe and went on to help guide the field's post-WWII expansion. True to her feminist ideals and with the help of her husband, she juggled marriage, her three careers, and the parenting of four children. She thus serves as a noteworthy member of the second generation of women in psychology in the United States. Using unpublished correspondence between Kendig, her parents, and her future husband, this article offers a rare glimpse of a young feminist struggling to build a career and a life unconstrained by patriarchal norms.

Expert analysis of dental radiographs can provide crucial information for clinical diagnosis and treatment. In recent years, Convolutional Neural Networks have achieved the highest accuracy in various benchmarks, including analyzing dental X-ray images to improve clinical care quality. The Tufts Dental Database, a new X-ray panoramic radiography image dataset, has been presented in this paper. This dataset consists of 1000 panoramic dental radiography images with expert labeling of abnormalities and teeth. The classification of radiography images was performed based on five different levels: anatomical location, peripheral characteristics, radiodensity, effects on the surrounding structure, and the abnormality category. This first-of-its-kind multimodal dataset also includes the radiologist's expertise captured in the form of eye-tracking and think-aloud protocol. The contributions of this work are 1) publicly available dataset that can help researchers to incorporate human expertise into AI and achieve more robust and accurate abnormality detection; 2) a benchmark performance analysis for various state-of-the-art systems for dental radiograph image enhancement and image segmentation using deep learning; 3) an in-depth review of various panoramic dental image datasets, along with segmentation and detection systems. The release of this dataset aims to propel the development of AI-powered automated abnormality detection and classification in dental panoramic radiographs, enhance tooth segmentation algorithms, and the ability to distill the radiologist's expertise into AI.", "Due to the concentration effect, there is a major challenge for the electronic nose system to identify different odor samples with multiple concentrations. The development of artificial intelligence provides new ways to solve such problems. This article attempts to use support vector machine (SVM) technology to distinguish four fragrance samples with three concentrations, including roman chamomile, jasmine, lavender, and orange. The responses of these samples were collected by an 11-sensor electronic nose. After baseline correction, data smoothing, and removal of non-responsive sensors, the signals of 8 sensors were used for subsequent model analysis. Due to the concentration effect, when the primary signal intensities were used as features, the electronic nose cannot distinguish between different aroma types (accuracy less than 50%). When the normalized maximum signal intensity Xmr was used, the accuracy of the model was greatly improved. Graphic analysis and PCA showed that the normalized feature effectively eliminates the concentration effect, and appropriately reducing some sensors can enhance the ability to distinguish odors. The SVM correctly classified all 14 aromas when feeding 8 sets of data to train the radial kernel C-classification SVM. This showed that the cross-interference of the sensors was reduced, and the resolving power of the electronic nose was enhanced after the feature reduction.", "On October 5, 2020, the Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention Society (MICCAI) 2020 conference hosted a virtual panel discussion with members of the Machine Learning Steering Subcommittee of the Radiological Society of North America. The MICCAI Society brings together scientists, engineers, physicians, educators, and students from around the world. Both societies share a vision to develop radiologic and medical imaging techniques through advanced quantitative imaging biomarkers and artificial intelligence. The panel elaborated on how collaborations between radiologists and machine learning scientists facilitate the creation and clinical success of imaging technology for radiology.

We hypothesized that the neurocognitive dysfunction present in KS relies on an imbalance in X-chromosome gene expression. Thus, the X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) pattern and neurocognitive X-linked gene expression were tested and correlated with intelligence quotient (IQ) scores. We evaluated 11 KS patients by (a) IQ assessment, (b) analyzing the XCI patterns using both HUMARA and ZDHHC15 gene assays, and (c) blood RT-qPCR to investigate seven X-linked genes related to neurocognitive development (GTPBP6, EIF2S3, ITM2A, HUWE1, KDM5C, GDI1, and VAMP7) and XIST in comparison with 14 (male and female) controls. Considering IQ 80 as the standard minimum reference, we verified that the variability in IQ scores in KS patients seemed to be associated with the XCI pattern. Seven individuals in the KS group presented a random X-inactivation (RXI) and lower average IQ than the four individuals who presented a skewed X-inactivation (SXI) pattern. The evaluation of gene expression showed higher GTPBP6 expression in KS patients with RXI than in controls (p = 0.0059). Interestingly, the expression of GTPBP6 in KS patients with SXI did not differ from that observed in controls. Therefore, our data suggest for the first time that GTPBP6 expression is negatively associated with full-scale IQ under the regulation of the type of XCI pattern. The SXI pattern may regulate GTPBP6 expression, thereby dampening the impairment in cognitive performance and playing a role in intelligence variability in individuals with KS, which warrants further mechanistic investigations.", "While general mechanisms by which Plasmodium ookinetes invade the mosquito midgut have been studied, details regarding the interface of the ookinete, specifically its barriers to invasion, such as the proteolytic milieu, the chitin-containing, protein cross-linked peritrophic matrix, and the midgut epithelium, remain to be understood. Here, we review our knowledge of Plasmodium chitinases and the mechanisms by which they mediate ookinetes crossing the peritrophic matrix. The integration of new genomic insights into previous findings advances our understanding of Plasmodium evolution. Recently obtained Plasmodium species genomic data enable identification of the conserved residues in the experimentally demonstrated hetero-multimeric, high-molecular-weight complex comprised of a short chitinase covalently linked to binding partners, von Willebrand factor A domain-related protein (WARP) and secreted ookinete adhesive protein (SOAP). Artificial intelligence-based high-resolution structural modeling using the DeepMind AlphaFold algorithm yielded highly informative three-dimensional structures and insights into how short chitinases, WARP, and SOAP may interact at the atomic level to form the ookinete-secreted peritrophic matrix invasion complex. Elucidating the significance of the divergence of ookinete-secreted micronemal proteins among Plasmodium species may lead to a better understanding of the ookinete invasion machinery and the coevolution of Plasmodium-mosquito interactions.", "The regulatory landscape for artificial intelligence (AI) is shaping up on both sides of the Atlantic, urgently awaited by the scientific and industrial community. Commonalities and differences start to crystallize in the approaches to AI in medicine.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) has made important progress in image recognition and disease prognosis prediction in recent years. Along with the development of computer technology, the application scope of AI in the field of ophthalmology is expanding. Keratoconus screening is an important means to determine the indication of refractive surgery and avoid postoperative corneal ectasia, but the accuracy of traditional diagnostic methods is low, especially for subclinical keratoconus. Machine learning, a method to realize artificial intelligence, makes it possible to improve the accuracy of keratoconus screening, and has become a hotspot in the field of refractive surgery recently. The review has clarified the algorithms commonly used in keratoconus screening for refractive surgery, the extraction of corneal features, and the accuracy of model prediction.(Chin J Ophthalmol, 2021, 57: 796-800).\n\u8fd1\u5e74\u6765\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u8bc6\u522b\u3001\u9884\u6d4b\u75be\u75c5\u9884\u540e\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002\u968f\u7740\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u6280\u672f\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u5728\u773c\u79d1\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u8303\u56f4\u4e0d\u65ad\u6269\u5927\u3002\u5706\u9525\u89d2\u819c\u7b5b\u67e5\u662f\u786e\u5b9a\u5c48\u5149\u624b\u672f\u9002\u5e94\u8bc1\u3001\u907f\u514d\u672f\u540e\u89d2\u819c\u6269\u5f20\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u624b\u6bb5\uff0c\u800c\u4f20\u7edf\u8bca\u65ad\u65b9\u6cd5\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8f83\u4f4e\uff0c\u4e9a\u4e34\u5e8a\u671f\u5706\u9525\u89d2\u819c\u66f4\u52a0\u96be\u4ee5\u53d1\u73b0\u3002\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u73b0\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u8f83\u4e3a\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u8bc6\u522b\u5706\u9525\u89d2\u819c\u5e26\u6765\u53ef\u80fd\uff0c\u6210\u4e3a\u8fd1\u51e0\u5e74\u5c48\u5149\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u70ed\u70b9\u3002\u672c\u7efc\u8ff0\u4ece\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u89d2\u819c\u5c48\u5149\u624b\u672f\u672f\u524d\u5706\u9525\u89d2\u819c\u7b5b\u67e5\u4e2d\u5e38\u7528\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u3001\u89d2\u819c\u7279\u5f81\u53c2\u6570\u63d0\u53d6\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u6548\u7387\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u8fdb\u884c\u9610\u8ff0\u3002\uff08\u4e2d\u534e\u773c\u79d1\u6742\u5fd7\uff0c2021\uff0c57\uff1a796-800\uff09.", "In the present study, two kernel-based data-intelligence paradigms, namely, Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) and Kernel Extreme Learning Machine (KELM) along with Generalized Regression Neural Network (GRNN) and Response Surface Methodology (RSM), as the validated schemes, employed to precisely estimate the elliptical side orifice discharge coefficient in rectangular channels. A total of 588 laboratory data in various geometric and hydraulic conditions were used to develop the models. The discharge coefficient was considered as a function of five dimensionless hydraulically and geometrical variables. The results showed that the machine learning models used in this study had shown good performance compared to the regression-based relationships. Comparison between machine learning models showed that GPR (RMSE\u2009=\u20090.0081, R\u2009=\u20090.958, MAPE\u2009=\u20091.3242) and KELM (RMSE\u2009=\u20090.0082, R\u2009=\u20090.9564, MAPE\u2009=\u20091.3499) models provide higher accuracy. Base on the RSM model, a new practical equation was developed to predict the discharge coefficient. Also, the sensitivity analysis of the input parameters showed that the main channel width to orifice height ratio (B/b) has the most significant effect on determining the discharge coefficient. The leveraged approach was applied to identify outlier data and applicability domain.", "Background: Acute aortic dissection is a potentially fatal cardiovascular disorder associated with high mortality. However, current predictive models show a limited ability to efficiently and flexibly detect this mortality risk, and have been unable to discover a relationship between the mortality rate and certain variables. Thus, this study takes an artificial intelligence approach, whereby clinical data-driven machine learning was utilized to predict the in-hospital mortality of acute aortic dissection. Methods: Patients diagnosed with acute aortic dissection between January 2015 to December 2018 were voluntarily enrolled from the Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University in the study. The diagnosis was defined by magnetic resonance angiography or computed tomography angiography, with an onset time of the symptoms being within 14 days. The analytical variables included demographic characteristics, physical examination, symptoms, clinical condition, laboratory results, and treatment strategies. The machine learning algorithms included logistic regression, decision tree, K nearest neighbor, Gaussian naive bayes, and extreme gradient boost (XGBoost). Evaluation of the predictive performance of the models was mainly achieved using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. SHapley Additive exPlanation was also implemented to interpret the final prediction model. Results: A total of 1,344 acute aortic dissection patients were recruited, including 1,071 (79.7%) patients in the survivor group and 273 (20.3%) patients in non-survivor group. The extreme gradient boost model was found to be the most effective model with the greatest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (0.927, 95% CI: 0.860-0.968). The three most significant aspects of the extreme gradient boost importance matrix plot were treatment, type of acute aortic dissection, and ischemia-modified albumin levels. In the SHapley Additive exPlanation summary plot, medical treatment, type A acute aortic dissection, and higher ischemia-modified albumin level were shown to increase the risk of hospital-based mortality.", "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder. Though it is not yet curable or reversible, research has shown that clinical intervention or intensive cognitive training at an early stage may effectively delay the progress of the disease. As a result, screening populations with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or early AD via efficient, effective and low-cost cognitive assessments is important. Currently, a cognitive assessment relies mostly on cognitive tests, such as the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) or the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), which must be performed by therapists. Also, cognitive functions can be divided into a variety of dimensions, such as memory, attention, executive function, visual spatial and so on. Executive functions (EF), also known as executive control or cognitive control, refer to a set of skills necessary to perform higher-order cognitive processes, including working memory, planning, attention, cognitive flexibility, and inhibitory control. Along with the fast progress of virtual reality (VR) and artificial intelligence (AI), this study proposes an intelligent assessment method aimed at assessing executive functions. Utilizing machine learning to develop an automatic evidence-based assessment model, behavioral information is acquired through performing executive-function tasks in a VR supermarket. Clinical trials were performed individuals with MCI or early AD and six healthy participants. Statistical analysis showed that 45 out of 46 indices derived from behavioral information were found to differ significantly between individuals with neurocognitive disorder and healthy participants. This analysis indicates these indices may be potential bio-markers. Further, machine-learning methods were applied to build classifiers that differentiate between individuals with MCI or early AD and healthy participants. The accuracy of the classifier is up to 100%, demonstrating the derived features from the VR system were highly related to diagnosis of individuals with MCI or early AD.", "Understanding why some species thrive in captivity, while others struggle to adjust, can suggest new ways to improve animal care. Approximately half of all Psittaciformes, a highly threatened order, live in zoos, breeding centres and private homes. Here, some species are prone to behavioural and reproductive problems that raise conservation and ethical concerns. To identify risk factors, we analysed data on hatching rates in breeding centres (115 species, 10 255 pairs) and stereotypic behaviour (SB) in private homes (50 species, 1378 individuals), using phylogenetic comparative methods (PCMs). Small captive population sizes predicted low hatch rates, potentially due to genetic bottlenecks, inbreeding and low availability of compatible mates. Species naturally reliant on diets requiring substantial handling were most prone to feather-damaging behaviours (e.g. self-plucking), indicating inadequacies in the composition or presentation of feed (often highly processed). Parrot species with relatively large brains were most prone to oral and whole-body SB: the first empirical evidence that intelligence can confer poor captive welfare. Together, results suggest that more naturalistic diets would improve welfare, and that intelligent psittacines need increased cognitive stimulation. These findings should help improve captive parrot care and inspire further PCM research to understand species differences in responses to captivity.", "With the advent of the big data era, the interest of the international community is focusing on increasing the utilization of medical big data. Many hospitals are attempting to increase the efficiency of their operations and patient management by adopting artificial intelligence (AI) technology that enables the use of electronic medical record (EMR) data. EMR includes information about a patient's health history, such as diagnoses, medicines, tests, allergies, immunizations, treatment plans, personalized medical care, and improvement of medical quality and safety. EMR data can also be used for AI-based new drug development. In particular, it is effective to develop AI that can predict the occurrence of specific diseases or provide individualized customized treatments by classifying the individualized characteristics of patients. In order to improve performance of artificial intelligence research using EMR data, standardization and refinement of data are essential. In addition, since EMR data deal with sensitive personal information of patients, it is also vital to protect the patient's privacy. There are already various supports for the use of EMR data in the Korean government, and researchers are encouraged to be proactive.", "Evidence of associations of pre- and postnatal exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) with cognitive development beyond early childhood is inconsistent. A previous report from this cohort observed adverse associations between early life PCB exposures and infant Bayley scores at age 16 months. The present study examines pre- and postnatal PCB exposures in relation to both behavior and cognitive development at age 45 months. Participants were 472 mother-child pairs residing in an area of eastern Slovakia characterized by environmental contamination with PCBs, which resulted in elevated blood serum concentrations. PCB-153 and PCB-118 concentrations were measured in maternal and in infant 6-, 16-, and 45-month serum samples. At age 45 months, children were administered five subtests of the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence (WPPSI-III), and mothers completed the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). Negative binomial and multiple linear regressions were used to estimate PCB-CBCL and PCB-WPPSI-III subtest score associations, respectively. Pre- and postnatal levels of PCB-153 and PCB-118 were not associated with cognitive performance on the WPPSI-III in this cohort. There was some suggestion that higher postnatal PCB concentrations were associated with more sleep problems and feelings of depression and anxiousness.", "In order to explore the quality management efficiency of applying big data and artificial intelligence in nursing quality index, a method of building a nursing management platform integrating nursing indicators and nursing events is proposed. Based on the investigation of the application demand of nursing information system, the method achieves timely data sharing and transmission through WLAN technology and realizes nursing management monitoring, nursing quality index enquiry, and automatic statistical analysis under the vertical management mode of nursing. The results showed that 77 people (73%) thought the time decreased, 19 people (18%) thought the time was the same, and 9 people (7%) thought the time increased. In terms of intelligent application and big data of nursing information management system, there is a significant difference in nursing management efficiency before and after using nursing management information system (P < 0.001). The nursing management control platform is designed and applied, and the nursing quality control method and actual management process are improved, which is very good for strengthening nursing quality management. The overall optimization of the quality control process is realized, which helps to mobilize the initiative and enthusiasm of nursing staff and continuously improve the effectiveness of nursing management and nursing efficiency.", "Biology has become a prime area for the deployment of deep learning and artificial intelligence (AI), enabled largely by the massive data sets that the field can generate. Key to most AI tasks is the availability of a sufficiently large, labeled data set with which to train AI models. In the context of microscopy, it is easy to generate image data sets containing millions of cells and structures. However, it is challenging to obtain large-scale high-quality annotations for AI models. Here, we present HALS (Human-Augmenting Labeling System), a human-in-the-loop data labeling AI, which begins uninitialized and learns annotations from a human, in real-time. Using a multi-part AI composed of three deep learning models, HALS learns from just a few examples and immediately decreases the workload of the annotator, while increasing the quality of their annotations. Using a highly repetitive use-case-annotating cell types-and running experiments with seven pathologists-experts at the microscopic analysis of biological specimens-we demonstrate a manual work reduction of 90.60%, and an average data-quality boost of 4.34%, measured across four use-cases and two tissue stain types.", "Radiomics refers to the extraction of mineable data from medical imaging and has been applied within oncology to improve diagnosis, prognostication, and clinical decision support, with the goal of delivering precision medicine. The authors provide a practical approach for successfully implementing a radiomic workflow from planning and conceptualization through manuscript writing. Applications in oncology typically are either classification tasks that involve computing the probability of a sample belonging to a category, such as benign versus malignant, or prediction of clinical events with a time-to-event analysis, such as overall survival. The radiomic workflow is multidisciplinary, involving radiologists and data and imaging scientists, and follows a stepwise process involving tumor segmentation, image preprocessing, feature extraction, model development, and validation. Images are curated and processed before segmentation, which can be performed on tumors, tumor subregions, or peritumoral zones. Extracted features typically describe the distribution of signal intensities and spatial relationship of pixels within a region of interest. To improve model performance and reduce overfitting, redundant and nonreproducible features are removed. Validation is essential to estimate model performance in new data and can be performed iteratively on samples of the dataset (cross-validation) or on a separate hold-out dataset by using internal or external data. A variety of noncommercial and commercial radiomic software applications can be used. Guidelines and artificial intelligence checklists are useful when planning and writing up radiomic studies. Although interest in the field continues to grow, radiologists should be familiar with potential pitfalls to ensure that meaningful conclusions can be drawn.

In this study, we aimed to investigate the relationships between maternal obesity during pregnancy and neonatal brain cortical development.\nForty-four healthy women (28 normal-weight, 16 obese) were prospectively recruited at <10\u2009weeks' gestation, and their healthy full-term neonates (23 boys, 21 girls) underwent brain MR imaging. All pregnant women had their body composition (fat mass percentage) measured at \u223c12 weeks of pregnancy. All neonates were scanned at \u223c2 weeks of age during natural sleep without sedation, and their 3D T1-weighted images were postprocessed by the new iBEAT2.0 software. Brain MR imaging segmentation and cortical surface reconstruction and parcellation were completed using age-appropriate templates. Mean cortical thickness for 34 regions in each brain hemisphere defined by the UNC Neonatal Cortical Surface Atlas was measured, compared between groups, and correlated with maternal body fat mass percentage, controlled for neonate sex and race, postmenstrual age at MR imaging, maternal age at pregnancy, and the maternal intelligence quotient and education.\nNeonates born to obese mothers showed significantly lower (P\u2009\u2264\u2009.05, false discovery rate-corrected) cortical thickness in the left pars opercularis gyrus, left pars triangularis gyrus, and left rostral middle frontal gyrus. Mean cortical thickness in these frontal lobe regions negatively correlated (R = -0.34, P\u2009=\u2009.04; R = -0.50, P\u2009=\u2009.001; and R = -0.42, P\u2009=\u2009.01; respectively) with the maternal body fat mass percentage measured at early pregnancy.\nMaternal obesity during pregnancy is associated with lower neonate brain cortical thickness in several frontal lobe regions important for language and executive functions.", "Artificial neural network (ANN) is one of the techniques in artificial intelligence, which has been widely applied in many fields for prediction purposes, including wind speed prediction. The aims of this research is to determine the topology of neural network that are used to predict wind speed. Topology determination means finding the hidden layers number and the hidden neurons number for corresponding hidden layer in the neural network. The difference between this research and previous research is that the objective function of this research is regression, while the objective function of previous research is classification. Determination of the topology of the neural network using principal component analysis (PCA) and K-means clustering. PCA is used to determine the hidden layers number, while clustering is used to determine the hidden neurons number for corresponding hidden layer. The selected topology is then used to predict wind speed. Then the performance of topology determination using PCA and clustering is then compared with several other methods. The results of the experiment show that the performance of the neural network topology determined using PCA and clustering has better performance than the other methods being compared. Performance is determined based on the RMSE value, the smaller the RMSE value, the better the neural network performance. In future research, it is necessary to apply a correlation or relationship between input attribute and output attribute and then analyzed, prior to conducting PCA and clustering analysis.", "The last two decades have produced unprecedented successes in the fields of artificial intelligence and machine learning (ML), due almost entirely to advances in deep neural networks (DNNs). Deep hierarchical memory networks are not a novel concept in cognitive science and can be traced back more than a half century to Simon's early work on discrimination nets for simulating human expertise. The major difference between DNNs and the deep memory nets meant for explaining human cognition is that the latter are symbolic networks meant to model the dynamics of human memory and learning. Cognition-inspired symbolic deep networks (SDNs) address several known issues with DNNs, including (1) learning efficiency, where a much larger number of training examples are required for DNNs than would be expected for a human; (2) catastrophic interference, where what is learned by a DNN gets unlearned when a new problem is presented; and (3) explainability, where there is no way to explain what is learned by a DNN. This paper explores whether SDNs can achieve similar classification accuracy performance to DNNs across several popular ML datasets and discusses the strengths and weaknesses of each approach. Simulations reveal that (1) SDNs provide similar accuracy to DNNs in most cases, (2) SDNs are far more efficient than DNNs, (3) SDNs are as robust as DNNs to irrelevant/noisy attributes in the data, and (4) SDNs are far more robust to catastrophic interference than DNNs. We conclude that SDNs offer a promising path toward human-level accuracy and efficiency in category learning. More generally, ML frameworks could stand to benefit from cognitively inspired approaches, borrowing more features and functionality from models meant to simulate and explain human learning.", "Knowledge of gas volume, tissue mass and recruitability measured by the quantitative CT scan analysis (CT-qa) is important when setting the mechanical ventilation in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Yet, the manual segmentation of the lung requires a considerable workload. Our goal was to provide an automatic, clinically applicable and reliable lung segmentation procedure. Therefore, a convolutional neural network (CNN) was used to train an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm on 15 healthy subjects (1,302 slices), 100 ARDS patients (12,279 slices), and 20 COVID-19 (1,817 slices). Eighty percent of this populations was used for training, 20% for testing. The AI and manual segmentation at slice level were compared by intersection over union (IoU). The CT-qa variables were compared by regression and Bland Altman analysis. The AI-segmentation of a single patient required 5-10 s vs. 1-2 h of the manual. At slice level, the algorithm showed on the test set an IOU across all CT slices of 91.3 \u00b1 10.0, 85.2 \u00b1 13.9, and 84.7 \u00b1 14.0%, and across all lung volumes of 96.3 \u00b1 0.6, 88.9 \u00b1 3.1, and 86.3 \u00b1 6.5% for normal lungs, ARDS and COVID-19, respectively, with a U-shape in the performance: better in the lung middle region, worse at the apex and base. At patient level, on the test set, the total lung volume measured by AI and manual segmentation had a R 2 of 0.99 and a bias -9.8 ml [CI: +56.0/-75.7 ml]. The recruitability measured with manual and AI-segmentation, as change in non-aerated tissue fraction had a bias of +0.3% [CI: +6.2/-5.5%] and -0.5% [CI: +2.3/-3.3%] expressed as change in well-aerated tissue fraction. The AI-powered lung segmentation provided fast and clinically reliable results. It is able to segment the lungs of seriously ill ARDS patients fully automatically.", "Research in artificial intelligence (AI) has progressed over the past decade. The field of cardiac imaging has seen significant developments using newly developed deep learning methods for automated image analysis and AI tools for disease detection and prognostication. This review is aimed at those without special background in AI. We review AI concepts and survey the growing contemporary applications of AI for image analysis in echocardiography, nuclear cardiology, cardiac computed tomography, cardiac magnetic resonance, and invasive angiography.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to transform our healthcare systems significantly. New AI technologies based on machine learning approaches should play a key role in clinical decision-making in the future. However, their implementation in health care settings remains limited, mostly due to a lack of robust validation procedures. There is a need to develop reliable assessment frameworks for the clinical validation of AI. We present here an approach for assessing AI for predicting treatment response in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), using real-world data and molecular -omics data from clinical data warehouses and biobanks.\nThe European \"ITFoC (Information Technology for the Future Of Cancer)\" consortium designed a framework for the clinical validation of AI technologies for predicting treatment response in oncology.\nThis framework is based on seven key steps specifying: (1) the intended use of AI, (2) the target population, (3) the timing of AI evaluation, (4) the datasets used for evaluation, (5) the procedures used for ensuring data safety (including data quality, privacy and security), (6) the metrics used for measuring performance, and (7) the procedures used to ensure that the AI is explainable. This framework forms the basis of a validation platform that we are building for the \"ITFoC Challenge\". This community-wide competition will make it possible to assess and compare AI algorithms for predicting the response to TNBC treatments with external real-world datasets.\nThe predictive performance and safety of AI technologies must be assessed in a robust, unbiased and transparent manner before their implementation in healthcare settings. We believe that the consideration of the ITFoC consortium will contribute to the safe transfer and implementation of AI in clinical settings, in the context of precision oncology and personalized care.", "Musical experience facilitates speech perception. French musicians, to whom stress is foreign, have been found to perceive English stress more accurately than French non-musicians. This study investigated whether this musical advantage also applies to native listeners. English musicians and non-musicians completed an English stress discrimination task and two control tasks. With age, non-verbal intelligence and short-term memory controlled, the musicians exhibited a perceptual advantage relative to the non-musicians. This perceptual advantage was equally potent to both trochaic and iambic stress patterns. In terms of perceptual strategy, the two groups showed differential use of acoustic cues for iambic but not trochaic stress. Collectively, the results could be taken to suggest that musical experience enhances stress discrimination even among native listeners. Remarkably, this musical advantage is highly consistent and does not particularly favour either stress pattern. For iambic stress, the musical advantage appears to stem from the differential use of acoustic cues by musicians. For trochaic stress, the musical advantage may be rooted in enhanced durational sensitivity.", "COVID-19 is a pandemic initially identified in Wuhan, China, which is caused by a novel coronavirus, also recognized as the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-nCoV-2). Unlike other coronaviruses, this novel pathogen may cause unusual contagious pain, which results in viral pneumonia, serious heart problems, and even death. Researchers worldwide are continuously striving to develop a cure for this highly infectious disease, yet there are no well-defined absolute treatments available at present. Several vaccination drives using emergency use authorisation vaccines have been held across many countries; however, their long-term efficacy and side-effects studies are yet to be studied. Various analytical and statistical models have been developed, however, their outcome rate is prolonged. Thus, modern science stresses the application of state-of-the-art methods to combat COVID-19. This paper aims to provide a deep insight into the comprehensive literature about AI and AI-driven tools in the battle against the COVID-19 pandemic. The high efficacy of these AI systems can be observed in terms of highly accurate results, i.e., > 95%, as reported in various studies. The extensive literature reviewed in this paper is divided into five sections, each describing the application of AI against COVID-19 viz. COVID-19 prevention, diagnostic, infection spread trend prediction, therapeutic and drug repurposing. The application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and AI-driven tools are proving to be useful in managing and fighting against the COVID-19 pandemic, especially by analysing the X-Ray and CT-Scan imaging data of infected subjects, infection trend predictions, etc.", "Retained surgical items are a serious human error. Surgical sponges account for 70% of retained surgical items. To prevent retained surgical sponges, it is important to establish a system that can identify errors and avoid the occurrence of adverse events. To date, no computer-aided diagnosis software specialized for detecting retained surgical sponges has been reported. We developed a software program that enables easy and effective computer-aided diagnosis of retained surgical sponges with high sensitivity and specificity using the technique of deep learning, a subfield of artificial intelligence.\nIn this study, we developed the software by training it through deep learning using a dataset and then validating the software. The dataset consisted of a training set and validation set. We created composite x-rays consisting of normal postoperative x-rays and surgical sponge x-rays for a training set (n\u00a0= 4,554) and a validation set (n\u00a0= 470). Phantom x-rays (n\u00a0= 12) were prepared for software validation. X-rays obtained with surgical sponges inserted into cadavers were used for validation purposes (formalin: Thiel's method\u00a0= 252:117). In addition, postoperative x-rays without retained surgical sponges were used for the validation of software performance to determine false-positive rates. Sensitivity, specificity, and false positives per image were calculated.\nIn the phantom x-rays, both the sensitivity and specificity in software image interpretation were 100%. The software achieved 97.7% sensitivity and 83.8% specificity in the composite x-rays. In the normal postoperative x-rays, 86.6% specificity was achieved. In reading the cadaveric x-rays, the software attained both sensitivity and specificity of >90%.\nSoftware with high sensitivity for diagnosis of retained surgical sponges was developed successfully.", "Histopathologic evaluation of muscle biopsy samples is essential for classifying and diagnosing muscle diseases. However, the numbers of experienced specialists and pathologists are limited. Although new technologies such as artificial intelligence are expected to improve medical reach, their use with rare diseases, such as muscle diseases, is challenging because of the limited availability of training datasets. To address this gap, we developed an algorithm based on deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and collected 4041 microscopic images of 1400 hematoxylin-and-eosin-stained pathology slides stored in the National Center of Neurology and Psychiatry for training CNNs. Our trained algorithm differentiated idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (mostly treatable) from hereditary muscle diseases (mostly non-treatable) with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.996 and achieved better sensitivity and specificity than the diagnoses done by nine physicians under limited diseases and conditions. Furthermore, it successfully and accurately classified four subtypes of the idiopathic inflammatory myopathies with an average AUC of 0.958 and classified seven subtypes of hereditary muscle disease with an average AUC of 0.936. We also established a method to validate the similarity between the predictions made by the algorithm and the seven physicians using visualization technology and clarified the validity of the predictions. These results support the reliability of the algorithm and suggest that our algorithm has the potential to be used straightforwardly in a clinical setting.", "This study aimed to develop an artificial intelligence (AI)-based tool for screening COVID-19 patients based on the acoustic parameters of their voices. Twenty-five acoustic parameters were extracted from voice samples of 203 COVID-19 patients and 171 healthy individuals who produced a sustained vowel, i.e., /a/, as long as they could after a deep breath. The selected acoustic parameters were from different categories including fundamental frequency and its perturbation, harmonicity, vocal tract function, airflow sufficiency, and periodicity. After the feature extraction, different machine learning methods were tested. A leave-one-subject-out validation scheme was used to tune the hyper-parameters and record the test set results. Then the models were compared based on their accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Based on accuracy (89.71%), recall (91.63%), and F1-score (90.62%), the best model was the feedforward neural network (FFNN). Its precision function (89.63%) was a bit lower than the logistic regression (90.17%). Based on these results and confusion matrices, the FFNN model was employed in the software. This screening tool could be practically used at home and public places to ensure the health of each individual's respiratory system. If there are any related abnormalities in the test taker's voice, the tool recommends that they seek a medical consultant.", "Prostate MRI improves detection of clinically significant prostate cancer; however, its diagnostic performance has wide variation. Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to assist radiologists in the detection and classification of prostatic lesions. Herein, we aimed to develop and test a cascaded deep learning detection and classification system trained on biparametric prostate MRI using PI-RADS for assisting radiologists during prostate MRI read out.\nT2-weighted, diffusion-weighted (ADC maps, high b value DWI) MRI scans obtained at 3 Tesla from two institutions (n\u00a0=\u00a01043 in-house and n\u00a0=\u00a0347 Prostate-X, respectively) acquired between 2015 to 2019 were used for model training, validation, testing. All scans were retrospectively reevaluated by one radiologist. Suspicious lesions were contoured and assigned a PI-RADS category. A 3D U-Net-based deep neural network was used to train an algorithm for automated detection and segmentation of prostate MRI lesions. Two 3D residual neural network were used for a 4-class classification task to predict PI-RADS categories 2 to 5 and BPH. Training and validation used 89% (n\u00a0=\u00a01290 scans) of the data using 5 fold cross-validation, the remaining 11% (n\u00a0=\u00a0150 scans) were used for independent testing. Algorithm performance at lesion level was assessed using sensitivities, positive predictive values (PPV), false discovery rates (FDR), classification accuracy, Dice similarity coefficient (DSC). Additional analysis was conducted to compare AI algorithm's lesion detection performance with targeted biopsy results.\nMedian age was 66 years (IQR\u00a0=\u00a060-71), PSA 6.7 ng/ml (IQR\u00a0=\u00a04.7-9.9) from in-house cohort. In the independent test set, algorithm correctly detected 111 of 198 lesions leading to 56.1% (49.3%-62.6%) sensitivity. PPV was 62.7% (95% CI 54.7%-70.7%) with FDR of 37.3% (95% CI 29.3%-45.3%). Of 79 true positive lesions, 82.3% were tumor positive at targeted biopsy, whereas of 57 false negative lesions, 50.9% were benign at targeted biopsy. Median DSC for lesion segmentation was 0.359. Overall PI-RADS classification accuracy was 30.8% (95% CI 24.6%-37.8%).\nOur cascaded U-Net, residual network architecture can detect, classify cancer suspicious lesions at prostate MRI with good detection, reasonable classification performance metrics.", "Long-duration space missions to Mars will impose extreme stresses of physical and psychological nature on the crew, as well as significant logistical and technical challenges for life support and transportation. Main challenges include optimising overall mass and maintaining crew physical and mental health. These key scopes have been taken up as the baseline for a study by the European Space Agency (ESA) using its Concurrent Design Facility (CDF). It focussed on the biology of hibernation in reducing metabolism and hence stress, and its links to the infrastructure and life support. We concluded that torpor of crew members can reduce the payload with respect to oxygen, food and water but will require monitoring and artificial intelligence (AI) assisted monitoring of the crew. These studies additionally offer new potential applications for patient care on Earth. Keywords: Space flight, concurrent design facility, metabolic reduction.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) using deep learning methods for polyp detection (CADe) and characterization (CADx) is on the verge of clinical application. CADe already implied its potential use in randomized controlled trials.

Small-medium enterprises of some sectors need to be aware of both the pandemic evolution and the corresponding sentiments of customers in order to figure out which are the best commercialization techniques. This article proposes an expert system based on the combination of machine learning and sentiment analysis in order to support business decisions with data fusion through web scraping. The system uses human-centric artificial intelligence for automatically generating explanations. The expert system feeds from online content from different sources using a scraping module. It allows users to interact with the expert system providing feedback, and the system uses this feedback to improve its recommendations with supervised learning.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) is an overarching term that encompasses a set of computational approaches that are trained through generalised learning to autonomously execute specific tasks. AI is a rapidly expanding field in medicine. In particular cardiology, with its high reliance on numerical patient data in decision making, has great potential to benefit from AI. Types of AI, including neural networks and computer vision, can dramatically change the day-to-day workflow of cardiologists, primarily through integration in diagnostic imaging modalities, periprocedural planning, electronic health record analysis and patient monitoring. Healthcare systems will undoubtedly become more automated and shift to more AI-driven methods to improve efficiency and reduce cost. Patients in the end will benefit from these changes with improved diagnostic accuracy, better tailored treatments resulting in a greater quality and quantity of life. In this article, we will describe some of the fundamental principles underlying AI that physicians should have an understanding of, along with current clinical applications.", "Cognitive decline is frequently observed after chemotherapy. As chemotherapy is associated with changes in brain white matter microstructure, we investigated whether white matter microstructure before chemotherapy is a risk factor for cognitive decline after chemotherapy.\nNeuropsychologic tests were administered before and 6 months (n = 49), 2 years (n = 32), and 3 years (n = 32) after chemotherapy in patients with breast cancer receiving anthracycline-based chemotherapy (BC + CT group), at matched intervals to patients with BC who did not receive systemic therapy (BC - CT group: n = 39, 23, and 19, respectively) and to no-cancer controls (NC group: n = 37, 29, and 28, respectively). Using multivariate normative comparison, we evaluated to what extent the cognitive profiles of patients deviated from those of controls. Fractional anisotropy (FA), derived from magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging, was used to measure white matter microstructure before treatment. FA was evaluated as a risk factor for cognitive decline, in addition to baseline age, fatigue, cognitive complaints, and premorbid intelligence quotient. We subsequently ran voxel-wise diffusion tensor imaging analyses to investigate white matter microstructure in specific nerve tracts.\nLow FA independently predicted cognitive decline early (6 months, P = .013) and late (3 years, P < .001) after chemotherapy. FA did not predict cognitive decline in the BC - CT and NC groups. Voxel-wise analysis indicated involvement of white matter tracts essential for cognitive functioning.\nLow FA may reflect low white matter reserve. This may be a risk factor for cognitive decline after chemotherapy for BC. If validated in future trials, identification of patients with low white matter reserve could improve patient care, for example, by facilitating targeted, early interventions or even by influencing choices of patients and doctors for receiving chemotherapy.", "Determining the reaction pathways, which is central to illustrating the working mechanisms of a catalyst, is severely hindered by the high complexity of the reaction and the extreme scarcity of the data. Here, we develop a novel artificial intelligence framework integrating deep reinforcement learning (DRL) techniques with density functional theory simulations to automate the quantitative search and evaluation on the complex catalytic reaction networks from zero knowledge. Our framework quantitatively transforms the first-principles-derived free energy landscape of the chemical reactions to a DRL environment and the corresponding actions. By interacting with this dynamic environment, our model evolves by itself from scratch to a complete reaction path. We demonstrate this framework using the Haber-Bosch process on the most active Fe(111) surface. The new path found by our framework has a lower overall free energy barrier than the previous study based on domain knowledge, demonstrating its outstanding capability in discovering complicated reaction paths. Looking forward, we anticipate that this framework will open the door to exploring the fundamental reaction mechanisms of many catalytic reactions.", "Objective: Providing effective and correct care to patients requires clinical competence. One of the important components in clinical competence is spiritual intelligence the purpose of the study was to consider the correlation between clinical competence and spiritual intelligence in students who are children of victims of war of Hamadan University of Medical Sciences in 2019. Method : The cross-sectional study was carried out on 145 Martyrs' and War Veterans' Students of medical, nursing, midwifery, and paramedical schools. Sampling was done through census of students of operating room, anesthesia, medicine, nursing, midwifery, laboratory science, and radiology. The data collection tools were Kazdin et al's (1986) Spiritual Intelligence questionnaire and Liu et al's (2009) Clinical Competency Assessment questionnaire. Data were analyzed by SPSS 23 software. Results: The results of data analysis showed a direct, positive, and significant linear relationship between spiritual intelligence and clinical competence of all students (P < 0.05). According to the students' self-report, the highest mean score of clinical competency of the students was related to medical students with a mean score of 37 and the lowest to the laboratory students with a mean score of 30 (P =0.012). In addition, the results showed that the highest mean score of spiritual intelligence belonged to nursing students with a score of 48 (good spiritual intelligence) and the lowest to radiology students with a score of 39 (moderate spiritual intelligence) (P =0.019). Conclusion: We found that there is a direct and positive correlation between spiritual intelligence and clinical competence, so it seems that promoting spiritual intelligence may be associated with an increase in clinical competence.", "Multiple types of synaptic transistors that are capable of processing electrical signals similar to the biological neural system hold enormous potential for application in parallel computing, logic circuits and peripheral detection. However, most of these presented synaptic transistors are confined to a single mode of synaptic plasticity under an electrical stimulus, which tremendously limits efficient memory formation and the multifunctional integration of synaptic transistors. Here, we proposed a bi-mode electrolyte-gated synaptic transistor (BEST) with two dynamic processes, the formation of an electrical double layer (EDL) and electrochemical doping (ECD) by tuning the applied voltages, thereby allowing volatile and non-volatile behavior, which is associated with additional ion doping and nanoscale ionic transport. Benefiting from two controllable dynamic processes, we surprisingly found a third state in the transfer curves besides the \"off\" and \"on\" states. Moreover, utilizing this unique property, an artificial nociceptor with multilevel modulation of sensitivity was realized based on our bi-mode device. Finally, a haptic sensory system was constructed to exhibit robotic motion that revealed a unique threshold switching behavior, indicating the applicability to peripheral sensing circuits. Hence, the presented bi-mode synaptic transistor provides promising prospects in achieving multiple-mode integrated devices and simplifying neural circuits, which shows great potential in the development of artificial intelligence.", "Significant investments and advances in health care technologies and practices have created a need for digital and data-literate health care providers. Artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms transform the analysis, diagnosis, and treatment of medical conditions. Complex and massive data sets are informing significant health care decisions and clinical practices. The ability to read, manage, and interpret large data sets to provide data-driven care and to protect patient privacy are increasingly critical skills for today's health care providers.\nThe aim of this study is to accelerate the appropriate adoption of data-driven and AI-enhanced care by focusing on the mindsets, skillsets, and toolsets of point-of-care health providers and their leaders in the health system.\nTo accelerate the adoption of AI and the need for organizational change at a national level, our multistepped approach includes creating awareness and capacity building, learning through innovation and adoption, developing appropriate and strategic partnerships, and building effective knowledge exchange initiatives. Education interventions designed to adapt knowledge to the local context and address any challenges to knowledge use include engagement activities to increase awareness, educational curricula for health care providers and leaders, and the development of a coaching and practice-based innovation hub. Framed by the Knowledge-to-Action framework, we are currently in the knowledge creation stage to inform the curricula for each deliverable. An environmental scan and scoping review were conducted to understand the current state of AI education programs as reported in the academic literature.\nThe environmental scan identified 24 AI-accredited programs specific to health providers, of which 11 were from the United States, 6 from Canada, 4 from the United Kingdom, and 3 from Asian countries. The most common curriculum topics across the environmental scan and scoping review included AI fundamentals, applications of AI, applied machine learning in health care, ethics, data science, and challenges to and opportunities for using AI.\nTechnologies are advancing more rapidly than organizations, and professionals can adopt and adapt to them. To help shape AI practices, health care providers must have the skills and abilities to initiate change and shape the future of their discipline and practices for advancing high-quality care within the digital ecosystem.\nPRR1-10.2196/30940.", "Optimizing the CT acquisition parameters to obtain diagnostic image quality at the lowest possible radiation dose is crucial in the radiosensitive pediatric population. The image quality of low-dose CT can be severely degraded by increased image noise with filtered back projection (FBP) reconstruction. Iterative reconstruction (IR) techniques partially resolve the trade-off relationship between noise and radiation dose but still suffer from degraded noise texture and low-contrast detectability at considerably low-dose settings. Furthermore, sophisticated model-based IR usually requires a long reconstruction time, which restricts its clinical usability. With recent advances in artificial intelligence technology, deep learning-based reconstruction (DLR) has been introduced to overcome the limitations of the FBP and IR approaches and is currently available clinically. DLR incorporates convolutional neural networks-which comprise multiple layers of mathematical equations-into the image reconstruction process to reduce image noise, improve spatial resolution, and preserve preferable noise texture in the CT images. For DLR development, numerous network parameters are iteratively optimized through an extensive learning process to discriminate true attenuation from noise by using low-dose training and high-dose teaching image data. After rigorous validations of network generalizability, the DLR engine can be used to generate high-quality images from low-dose projection data in a short reconstruction time in a clinical environment. Application of the DLR technique allows substantial dose reduction in pediatric CT performed for various clinical indications while preserving the diagnostic image quality. The authors present an overview of the basic concept, technical principles, and image characteristics of DLR and its clinical feasibility for low-dose pediatric CT. \u00a9RSNA, 2021.", "The goal of this study was to develop and evaluate the performance of a new deep-learning (DL) artificial intelligence (AI) model for diagnostic charting in panoramic radiography.\nOne thousand eighty-four anonymous dental panoramic radiographs were labeled by two dento-maxillofacial radiologists for ten different dental situations: crown, pontic, root-canal treated tooth, implant, implant-supported crown, impacted tooth, residual root, filling, caries, and dental calculus. AI Model CranioCatch, developed in Eski\u015fehir, Turkey and based on a deep CNN method, was proposed to be evaluated. A Faster R-CNN Inception v2 (COCO) model implemented with the TensorFlow library was used for model development. The assessment of AI model performance was evaluated with sensitivity, precision, and F1 scores.\nWhen the performance of the proposed AI model for detecting dental conditions in panoramic radiographs was evaluated, the best sensitivity values were obtained from the crown, implant, and impacted tooth as 0.9674, 0.9615, and 0.9658, respectively. The worst sensitivity values were obtained from the pontic, caries, and dental calculus, as 0.7738, 0.3026, and 0.0934, respectively. The best precision values were obtained from pontic, implant, implant-supported crown as 0.8783, 0.9259, and 0.8947, respectively. The worst precision values were obtained from residual root, caries, and dental calculus, as 0.6764, 0.5096, and 0.1923, respectively. The most successful F1 Scores were obtained from the implant, crown, and implant-supported crown, as 0.9433, 0.9122, and 0.8947, respectively.\nThe proposed AI model has promising results at detecting dental conditions in panoramic radiographs, except for caries and dental calculus. Thanks to the improvement of AI models in all areas of dental radiology, we predict that they will help physicians in panoramic diagnosis and treatment planning, as well as digital-based student education, especially during the pandemic period.", "In silico driven optimization of compound properties related to pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and safety is a key requirement in modern drug discovery. Nowadays, large and harmonized datasets allow to implement deep neural networks (DNNs) as a framework for leveraging predictive models. Nevertheless, various available model architectures differ in their global applicability and performance in lead optimization projects, such as stability over time and interpretability of the results. Here, we describe and compare the value of established DNN-based methods for the prediction of key ADME property trends and biological activity in an industrial drug discovery environment, represented by microsomal lability, CYP3A4 inhibition and factor Xa inhibition. Three architectures are exemplified, our earlier described multilayer perceptron approach (MLP), graph convolutional network-based models (GCN) and a vector representation approach, Mol2Vec. From a statistical perspective, MLP and GCN were found to perform superior over Mol2Vec, when applied to external validation sets. Interestingly, GCN-based predictions are most stable over a longer period in a time series validation study. Apart from those statistical observations, DNN prove of value to guide local SAR. To illustrate this important aspect in pharmaceutical research projects, we discuss challenging applications in medicinal chemistry towards a more realistic picture of artificial intelligence in drug discovery.", "Mutations in SPTAN1 gene, encoding the nonerythrocyte \u03b1II-spectrin, are responsible for a severe developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE5) and a wide spectrum of neurodevelopmental disorders, as epilepsy with or without intellectual disability (ID) or ID with cerebellar syndrome. A certain genotype-phenotype correlation has been proposed according to the type and location of the mutation. Herein, we report three novel cases with de novo SPTAN1 mutations, one of them associated to a mild phenotype not previously described. They range from (1) severe developmental encephalopathy with ataxia and a mild cerebellar atrophy, without epilepsy; (2) moderate intellectual disability, severe language delay, ataxia and tremor; (3) normal intelligence, chronic migraine, and generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Remarkably, all these patients showed brain MRI abnormalities, being of special interest the subependymal heterotopias detected in the latter patient. Thus we extend the SPTAN1-related phenotypic spectrum, both in its radiological and clinical involvement. Furthermore, after systematic analysis of all the patients so far reported, we noted an excess of male versus female patients (20:9, p\u00a0=\u00a00.04), more pronounced among the milder phenotypes. Consequently, some protection factor might be suspected among female carriers, which if confirmed should be considered when establishing the pathogenicity of milder genetic variants in this gene.", "To investigate cognitive correlates of instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) performance among people with Parkinson disease (PD) without dementia.\nCross-sectional.\nAcademic medical center.\nVolunteer sample (N=161) comprising participants with PD without dementia (n=102) and healthy comparison (HC) participants (n=59).\nNot applicable.\nPerformance-based assessment of cognitively-demanding IADL (meal preparation, bill paying, shopping, medication management, small home repair), neuropsychological tests (attentional control/flexibility, planning, working memory, memory, crystallized intelligence), and measures of motor function and other characteristics (eg, depressive symptoms).\nThere were no group differences in neuropsychological test performance (P>.06). The PD group performed more poorly than the HC group on a number of cognitive IADL tasks (P<.04). After accounting for the effects of motor impairment and other disease-related characteristics, neuropsychological test performance accounted for a small but unique portion of the variance in performance of all cognitive IADL combined, meal preparation, shopping, and medication management in the PD group (R 2=4%-13%; P\u2264.01).\nThe PD group had cognitive IADL performance limitations despite being unimpaired on neuropsychological tests. Within PD, neuropsychological test performance accounted for a small but significant portion of the variance in cognitive IADL performance over and above the effects of motor and other impairments. These results support the added value of using performance-based IADL assessments in functional evaluations of individuals with early and mild PD without dementia.", "It has been a landmark year for artificial intelligence (AI) and biotechnology. Perhaps the most noteworthy of these advances was Google DeepMind's AlphaFold2 algorithm which smashed records in protein structure prediction (Jumper et\u00a0al., 2021, Nature, 596, 583) complemented by progress made by other research groups around the globe (Baek et\u00a0al., 2021, Science, 373, 871; Zheng et\u00a0al., 2021, Proteins). For the first time in history, AI achieved protein structure models rivalling the accuracy of experimentally determined structures. The power of accurate protein structure prediction at our fingertips has countless implications for drug discovery, de novo protein design and fundamental research in chemical biology. While acknowledging the significance of these breakthroughs, this perspective aims to cut through the hype and examine some key limitations using AlphaFold2 as a lens to consider the broader implications of AI for microbial biotechnology for the next 15\u2009years and beyond.", "New information technology (IT) has been applied to prevent and control coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in many regions of China since the outbreak of COVID-19. This study aims to illustrate the current status and key areas of the application of new IT in the prevention and control of COVID-19.\nLiterature related to the prevention and control of COVID-19 with new IT since 2020 was retrieved from China National Knowledge Internet and Wanfang Literature databases, the two most authoritative databases in China.

The number of scientific publications have continuously increased for many years. There is an extensive portfolio of available AI algorithms for, e.g. automatic detection and preselection of pathologic patterns in images or for facilitating the reporting workflows. Even machines already use AI algorithms for improvement of operating comfort.\nThe use of SR is essential especially for the extraction of automatically evaluable semantic data from radiology results reports. Regarding eligibility in certification processes, the use of SR is mandatory for the accreditation of the German Cancer Society as an oncological center or outside Germany, such as the European Cancer Center.\nThe data from SR can be automatically evaluated for the purpose of patient care, research and educational purposes and quality assurance. Lack of information and a\u00a0high degree of variability often hamper the extraction of valid information from free-text reports using neurolinguistic programming (NLP). Against the background of supervised training, AI algorithms or k\u2011nearest neighbors (KNN) require a\u00a0considerable amount of validated data. The semantic data from SR can also be processed by AI and used for training.\nThe AI and SR are separate entities within the field of radiology with mutual dependencies and significant added value.

In a sample of 180 Spanish adults responding to the Wong-Law Emotional Intelligence Scale, a small prevalence (7.2%) was detected. The impact was small on the psychometric parameters, but they were less inflated, more realistic, and precise.", "Hundreds of imaging-based artificial intelligence (AI) models have been developed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. AI systems that incorporate imaging have shown promise in primary detection, severity grading, and prognostication of outcomes in COVID-19, and have enabled integration of imaging with a broad range of additional clinical and epidemiologic data. However, systematic reviews of AI models applied to COVID-19 medical imaging have highlighted problems in the field, including methodologic issues and problems in real-world deployment. Clinical use of such models should be informed by both the promise and potential pitfalls of implementation. How does a practicing radiologist make sense of this complex topic, and what factors should be considered in the implementation of AI tools for imaging of COVID-19? This critical review aims to help the radiologist understand the nuances that impact the clinical deployment of AI for imaging of COVID-19. We review imaging use cases for AI models in COVID-19 (e.g., diagnosis, severity assessment, and prognostication) and explore considerations for AI model development and testing, deployment infrastructure, clinical user interfaces, quality control, and institutional review board and regulatory approvals, with a practical focus on what a radiologist should consider when implementing an AI tool for COVID-19.", "As clean water can be considered among the essentials of human life, there is always a requirement to seek its foremost and high quality. Water primarily becomes polluted due to organic as well as inorganic pollutants, including nutrients, heavy metals, and constant contamination with organic materials. Predicting the quality of water accurately is essential for its better management along with controlling pollution. With stricter laws regarding water treatment to remove organic and biologic materials along with different pollutants, looking for novel technologic procedures will be necessary for improved control of the treatment processes by water utilities. Linear regression-based models with relative simplicity considering water prediction have been typically used as available statistical models. Nevertheless, in a majority of real problems, particularly those associated with modeling of water quality, non-linear patterns will be observed, requiring non-linear models to address them. Thus, artificial intelligence (AI) can be a good candidate in modeling and optimizing the elimination of pollutants from water in empirical settings with the ability to generate ideal operational variables, due to its recent considerable advancements. Management and operation of water treatment procedures are supported technically by these technologies, leading to higher efficiency compared to sole dependence on human operations. Thus, establishing predictive models for water quality and subsequently, more efficient management of water resources would be critically important, serving as a strong tool. A systematic review methodology has been employed in the present work to investigate the previous studies over the time interval of 2010-2020, while analyzing and synthesizing the literature, particularly regarding AI application in water treatment. A total number of 92 articles had addressed the topic under study using AI. Based on the conclusions, the application of AI can obviously facilitate operations, process automation, and management of water resources in significantly volatile contexts.", "This study examines participant satisfaction and effectiveness of the online mindset intervention 'The Growth Factory' (TGF) for youth with intellectual disabilities using a randomised controlled trial design.\nYouth with mild to borderline intellectual disabilities (N\u00a0=\u00a0119; 12-23\u2009years) were randomly assigned to TGF (n\u00a0=\u00a060) or control group (n\u00a0=\u00a059). Primary outcome measures were mindsets and perseverance. Secondary outcomes were empowerment, mental health problems, self-esteem, treatment motivation, therapeutic alliance and challenge seeking. Measurements were conducted at pre-test, post-test and at 3 and 6\u00a0months follow-up.\nTGF had positive effects on perseverance, mental health problems, self-esteem and therapeutic alliance at post-test. TGF had follow-up effects on mental health problems (3\u00a0months), mindset of intelligence (3 and 6\u00a0months) and mindset of emotion and behaviour (6\u00a0months).\nTGF offers a promising add-on intervention complementing usual care programmes accelerating improvements in mindsets and mental health in youth with intellectual disabilities.", "The vastness of the design space that is created by the combination of numerous computational mechanisms, including machine learning, is an obstacle to creating artificial general intelligence (AGI). Brain-inspired AGI development; that is, the reduction of the design space to resemble a biological brain more closely, is a promising approach for solving this problem. However, it is difficult for an individual to design a software program that corresponds to the entire brain as the neuroscientific data that are required to understand the architecture of the brain are extensive and complicated. The whole-brain architecture approach divides the brain-inspired AGI development process into the task of designing the brain reference architecture (BRA), which provides the flow of information and a diagram of the corresponding components, and the task of developing each component using the BRA. This is known as BRA-driven development. Another difficulty lies in the extraction of the operating principles that are necessary for reproducing the cognitive-behavioral function of the brain from neuroscience data. Therefore, this study proposes structure-constrained interface decomposition (SCID), which is a hypothesis-building method for creating a hypothetical component diagram that is consistent with neuroscientific findings. The application of this approach has been initiated for constructing various regions of the brain. In the future, we will examine methods for evaluating the biological plausibility of brain-inspired software. This evaluation will also be used to prioritize different computational mechanisms, which should be integrated and associated with the same regions of the brain.", "Inguinal hernia repair is one of the most frequently conducted surgical procedures worldwide. Laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair is considered to be technically challenging. Artificial intelligence technology has made significant progress in medical imaging, but its application in laparoscopic surgery has not been widely carried out. Our aim is to detect vas deferens images in laparoscopic inguinal hernial repair using the convolutional neural network (CNN) and help surgeons to identify the vas deferens in time. We collected surgery videos from 35 patients with inguinal hernia who underwent laparoscopic hernia repair. We classified and labeled the images of the vas deferens and used the CNN to learn the image features. Totally, 2,600 images (26 patients) were labeled for training and validating the neural network and 1,200 images (6 patients) and 6 short video clips (3 patients) for testing. We adjusted the model parameters and tested the performance of the model under different confidence levels and IoU and used the chi-square to analyze the statistical difference in the video test dataset. We evaluated the model performance by calculating the true positive rate (TPR), true negative rate (TNR), accuracy (ACC), positive predictive value (PPV), and F1-score at different confidence levels of 0.1 to 0.9. In confidence level 0.4, the results were TPR 90.61%, TNR 98.67%, PPV 98.57%, ACC 94.61%, and F1 94.42%, respectively. The average precision (AP) was 92.38% at IoU 0.3. In the video test dataset, the average values of TPR and TNR were 90.11% and 95.76%, respectively, and there was no significant difference among the patients. The results suggest that the CNN can quickly and accurately identify and label vas deferens images in laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair.", "The main goal of assisted reproductive technology (ART) is to achieve a healthy singleton live birth after the transfer of one embryo. A major objective of IVF scientists has always been to use adequate criteria for selecting the embryo for transfer according to its implantation potential. Indeed, embryo quality is usually assessed by evaluating visual morphology, which relies on the removal of the embryo from the incubator and might include inter- and intra-evaluator variation among embryologists. Recently, an advancement in embryo culture has taken place with the introduction of a new type of incubator with an integrated time-lapse monitoring system, which enables embryologists to analyse the dynamic events of embryo development from fertilization to blastocyst formation. This novel practice is rapidly growing and has been used in many IVF centres worldwide. Therefore, the main aim of this review is to present the benefits of time-lapse monitoring in a modern embryology laboratory; in particular, we discuss blastocyst collapse and morphometric blastocyst assessment, and analyse their association with embryo viability and implantation potential. In addition, we highlight preliminary studies involving artificial intelligence and machine learning models as non-invasive markers of clinical pregnancy.", "This study aims to assess the association between mode of delivery and human capital among young adults enrolled in the 1982 and 1993 Pelotas birth cohorts, Rio Grande do Sul State, Brasil. In 1982 and 1993, the maternity hospitals of the municipality were daily visited, the births identified, and those live births, whose family lived in the urban area of Pelotas, were examined and their mothers interviewed. Information on mode of delivery, vaginal or cesarean, was provided by the mother in the perinatal study. Performance in intelligence tests achieved schooling and income were evaluated in the 30 years visit at the 1982 cohort. At the 1993 cohort, schooling and income were assessed at the 22 years visit, whereas IQ was evaluated at 18 years. Tobacco smoking in adulthood and type of school was used as negative outcomes to strength causal inference. Initially, cesarean section was positively associated with human capital at adulthood, with the exception of income in the 1993 cohort. After controlling for confounders, the magnitude of the associations was strongly reduced, and the regression coefficients were close to the null value. The negative outcome analysis showed that, after controlling for confounding variables, the mode of delivery was not associated with tobacco smoking and type of school. Suggesting that the variables included in the regression model to control for confounding, provided an adequate adjustment and it is unlikely that the results are due to residual confounding by socioeconomic status. On the other hand, considering the short- and long-term risks and the epidemic of cesarean sections, measures should be implemented to reduce its prevalence.", "The year 2021 marks the 100th anniversary of the discovery of insulin, which has greatly changed the lives of people with diabetes and become a cornerstone of advances in medical science. A rapid bench-to-bedside application of the lifesaving pancreatic extract and its immediate commercialization was the result of a promising idea, positive drive, perseverance, and collaboration of Banting and colleagues. As one of the very few proteins isolated in a pure form at that time, insulin also played a key role in the development of important methodologies and in the beginning of various fields of modern science. Since its discovery, insulin has evolved continuously to optimize the care of people with diabetes. Since the 1980s, recombinant DNA technology has been employed to engineer insulin analogs by modifying their amino acid sequence, which has resulted in the production of insulins with various profiles that are currently used. However, unmet needs in insulin treatment still exist, and several forms of future insulins are under development. In this review, we discuss the past, present, and future of insulin, including a history of ceaseless innovations and collective intelligence. We believe that this story will be a solid foundation and an unerring guide for the future.", "The objective of this study is to investigate the mediating effect of placental inflammatory biomarkers on the relationship between prenatal phthalate coexposure and cognitive development in preschoolers. A subgroup of 1660 mother-child pairs from the Ma'anshan Birth Cohort study were included. We measured the levels of phthalate metabolites of dibutyl phthalate (DBP), butyl benzyl phthalate (BBzP), and di (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) in all the women included in the study from three urine samples collected in each of the trimesters. A potency-weighted sum of coexposure to DBP, BBzP, and DEHP (indicator: \u2211PAE) was calculated. The mRNA of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-6 and the classically activated macrophage (M1) biomarker CD68 was analyzed using placental tissues. The Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence-Fourth Edition-Chinese was used to evaluate the full-scale intelligence quotient (FSIQ) of children aged 2.5-6 years. Average \u2211PAEs and \u2211PAEs in each trimester were associated with IL-6 and CD68. \u2211PAE in the first trimester was positively associated with IL-6 (\u03b2 = 0.11, 95% CIs = 0.03-0.19) and CD68 (\u03b2 = 0.16, 95% CIs = 0.04-0.28), and negatively associated with FSIQ (\u03b2 =-0.06, 95% CIs = -0.11 to -0.02), verbal comprehension (\u03b2 =-0.06, 95% CIs = -0.11 to -0.01), and processing speed (\u03b2 =-0.07, 95% CIs = -0.12 to -0.01). Additionally, sex discrepancies were observed for the mediating effects of placental inflammation on the relationships between \u2211PAE and children's cognitive development. For instance, the association between \u2211PAE in early pregnancy and FSIQ was partially mediated by IL-6 (estimated proportion mediated: 21.85%) and CD68 (estimated proportion mediated: 16.2%). Gender-specific associations and trimester-specific relationships of prenatal multiple phthalate coexposure were revealed. \u2211PAE in the first trimester of pregnancy was associated with increased of placental inflammation, and a decrease in preschoolers' cognitive development. In boys, placental IL-6 and CD68 elevation resulting from phthalates might be potential mechanisms of poor cognitive development.", "With the rapid development of artificial intelligence in recent years, the research on image processing, text mining, and genome informatics has gradually deepened, and the mining of large-scale databases has begun to receive more and more attention. The objects of data mining have also become more complex, and the data dimensions of mining objects have become higher and higher. Compared with the ultra-high data dimensions, the number of samples available for analysis is too small, resulting in the production of high-dimensional small sample data. High-dimensional small sample data will bring serious dimensional disasters to the mining process. Through feature selection, redundancy and noise features in high-dimensional small sample data can be effectively eliminated, avoiding dimensional disasters and improving the actual efficiency of mining algorithms. However, the existing feature selection methods emphasize the classification or clustering performance of the feature selection results and ignore the stability of the feature selection results, which will lead to unstable feature selection results, and it is difficult to obtain real and understandable features. Based on the traditional feature selection method, this paper proposes an ensemble feature selection method, Random Bits Forest Recursive Clustering Eliminate (RBF-RCE) feature selection method, combined with multiple sets of basic classifiers to carry out parallel learning and screen out the best feature classification results, optimizes the classification performance of traditional feature selection methods, and can also improve the stability of feature selection. Then, this paper analyzes the reasons for the instability of feature selection and introduces a feature selection stability measurement method, the Intersection Measurement (IM), to evaluate whether the feature selection process is stable. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by experiments on several groups of high-dimensional small sample data sets.", "Artificial intelligence has aided in the advancement of healthcare research. The availability of open-source healthcare statistics has prompted researchers to create applications that aid cancer detection and prognosis. Deep learning and machine learning models provide a reliable, rapid, and effective solution to deal with such challenging diseases in these circumstances. PRISMA guidelines had been used to select the articles published on the web of science, EBSCO, and EMBASE between 2009 and 2021. In this study, we performed an efficient search and included the research articles that employed AI-based learning approaches for cancer prediction. A total of 185 papers are considered impactful for cancer prediction using conventional machine and deep learning-based classifications. In addition, the survey also deliberated the work done by the different researchers and highlighted the limitations of the existing literature, and performed the comparison using various parameters such as prediction rate, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, dice score, detection rate, area undercover, precision, recall, and F1-score. Five investigations have been designed, and solutions to those were explored. Although multiple techniques recommended in the literature have achieved great prediction results, still cancer mortality has not been reduced. Thus, more extensive research to deal with the challenges in the area of cancer prediction is required.", "We argue that population attributable fractions, probabilities of causation, burdens of disease, and similar association-based measures often do not provide valid estimates or surrogates for the fraction or number of disease cases that would be prevented by eliminating or reducing an exposure because their calculations do not include crucial mechanistic information. We use a thought experiment with a cascade of dominos to illustrate the need for mechanistic information when answering questions about how changing exposures changes risk. We suggest that modern methods of causal artificial intelligence (CAI) can fill this gap: they can complement and extend traditional epidemiological attribution calculations to provide information useful for risk management decisions.", "Emotional intelligence (EI) is known to improve teamwork, communication, and organizational commitment. The role of EI has also influenced pharmacists' ability to empathize, control emotions, and actively listen. Although EI's impact on work-related components, including occupational stress, job performance, and psychological affective well-being, has been studied, there are no data specific to the practice of pharmacy.\nThe primary objective of this study was to determine whether a significant correlation exists between pharmacist EI and work-related components.\nA voluntary Qualtrics survey (Qualtrics, Provo, UT) was distributed electronically to all active pharmacists licensed by the Florida Board of Pharmacy, which included questions from valid and reliable assessment tools. Spearman correlations were used to examine the association between EI facets and dependent variables of occupational stress, job performance, and psychological affective well-being. A subanalysis was conducted to evaluate demographic data. Statistical significance was set at P < 0.05 for all tests. Incomplete survey responses were included in the analysis.\nA total of 942 responses were received and analyzed. Most of the respondents were aged 44 years or younger (42.5%), female (46.9%), identified as Caucasian (52.8%), and worked 31-40 hours weekly (20.6%). Most of the respondents reported a primary employment setting within community (29.3%) or hospital (18.6%) pharmacy. Higher EI correlated with lower levels of occupational stress, higher job performance, and higher psychological affective well-being. Secondary outcomes reported increased stress for both females and those practicing in the community setting; hospital-based pharmacists reported higher job performance and psychological affective well-being. Stress decreased with both age and years of experience.\nHigher EI may support overall wellness for pharmacists on the basis of the results of this study. Additional evaluation of demographic data, including practice settings, and a more robust cohort of participants would provide more insight in this area.", "In recent times, cancer has become a leading cause of death worldwide, and a need for new therapeutic methods to save lives has become an inevitable necessity. Microbiome and its composition have been a key area of interest among the scientific community. Microbiota appears to hold the key to the therapeutic outcome of cancer by modulating the anti-tumor activity of drugs. Furthermore, the genetic composition of the microbiota and its matching gene sequences in the oncogene has added a new dimension to cancer research. However, it requires adaptive learning techniques and high computational power to bring this research to light empirically. This paper explores the role of machine learning (ML), a subset of artificial intelligence (AI), as a tool to investigate the possible role of the microbiome in the detection and treatment of cancer.", "The problem of optimizing over random structures emerges in many areas of science and engineering, ranging from statistical physics to machine learning and artificial intelligence. For many such structures, finding optimal solutions by means of fast algorithms is not known and often is believed not to be possible. At the same time, the formal hardness of these problems in the form of the complexity-theoretic NP-hardness is lacking. A new approach for algorithmic intractability in random structures is described in this article, which is based on the topological disconnectivity property of the set of pairwise distances of near-optimal solutions, called the Overlap Gap Property. The article demonstrates how this property 1) emerges in most models known to exhibit an apparent algorithmic hardness; 2) is consistent with the hardness/tractability phase transition for many models analyzed to the day; and, importantly, 3) allows to mathematically rigorously rule out a large class of algorithms as potential contenders, specifically the algorithms that exhibit the input stability (insensitivity).", "Many environmental chemicals are being identified as suspected neurotoxicants based on the findings of both experimental and epidemiological studies. Organophosphate esters (OPEs), which are among the chemicals that have replaced neurotoxic polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) after 2004, have also become an important public health topic as evidence regarding their potential for early-life neurotoxicity is growing. In 233 mother child pairs from Cincinnati, OH, we measured concentrations of the OPE metabolites bis(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate (BDCIPP), bis-2-chloroethyl phosphate (BCEP), diphenyl phosphate (DPHP), and di-n-butyl phosphate (DNBP) in the urine of pregnant women at 16 and 26 weeks gestation and at delivery. At age 8 years, we assessed children's cognition using the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-IV. In models adjusted for maternal race, income, body mass index, and IQ, maternal urinary BCEP was associated with a modest increase in child full-scale IQ (\u00df: 0.81 per a ln-unit BCEP increase; 95 % CI: 0.00, 1.61) while other OPEs were not associated with changes in full-scale IQ or any IQ subscales. Maternal serum PBDE concentrations did not confound the relationships between urinary OPE metabolites and child IQ. Using Bayesian kernel machine regression, we did not find that concentrations of a mixture of OPE metabolites during gestation was associated with any child cognition measures. The results of this study are not consistent with other published work, and a larger sample size would be beneficial to explore potential associations more fully. Therefore, additional studies are necessary to continue studying prenatal OPE exposure and child neurodevelopment and behavior.", "The authors developed an artificial intelligence (AI)-based algorithm for the design and optimization of a nuclear reactor core based on a flexible geometry and demonstrated a 3\u00d7 improvement in the selected performance metric: temperature peaking factor. The rapid development of advanced, and specifically, additive manufacturing (3-D printing) and its introduction into advanced nuclear core design through the Transformational Challenge Reactor program have presented the opportunity to explore the arbitrary geometry design of nuclear-heated structures. The primary challenge is that the arbitrary geometry design space is vast and requires the computational evaluation of many candidate designs, and the multiphysics simulation of nuclear systems is very time-intensive. Therefore, the authors developed a machine learning-based multiphysics emulator and evaluated thousands of candidate geometries on Summit, Oak Ridge National Laboratory's leadership class supercomputer. The results presented in this work demonstrate temperature distribution smoothing in a nuclear reactor core through the manipulation of the geometry, which is traditionally achieved in light water reactors through variable assembly loading in the axial direction and fuel shuffling during refueling in the radial direction. The conclusions discuss the future implications for nuclear systems design with arbitrary geometry and the potential for AI-based autonomous design algorithms.", "Chemical sensing is a strategic field of science and technology ultimately aiming at improving the quality of our lives and the sustainability of our Planet. Sensors bear a direct societal impact on well-being, which includes the quality and composition of the air we breathe, the water we drink, and the food we eat. Pristine low-dimensional materials are widely exploited as highly sensitive elements in chemical sensors, although they suffer from lack of intrinsic selectivity towards specific analytes. Here, we showcase the most recent strategies on the use of (supra)molecular interactions to harness the selectivity of suitably functionalized 0D, 1D, and 2D low-dimensional materials for chemical sensing. We discuss how the design and selection of receptors via machine learning and artificial intelligence hold a disruptive potential in chemical sensing, where selectivity is achieved by the design and high-throughput screening of large libraries of molecules exhibiting a set of affinity parameters that dictates the analyte specificity. We also discuss the importance of achieving selectivity along with other relevant characteristics in chemical sensing, such as high sensitivity, response speed, and reversibility, as milestones for true practical applications. Finally, for each distinct class of low-dimensional material, we present the most suitable functionalization strategies for their incorporation into efficient transducers for chemical sensing.", "Our brain can be recognized as a network of largely hierarchically organized neural circuits that operate to control specific functions, but when acting in parallel, enable the performance of complex and simultaneous behaviors. Indeed, many of our daily actions require concurrent information processing in sensorimotor, associative, and limbic circuits that are dynamically and hierarchically modulated by sensory information and previous learning. This organization of information processing in biological organisms has served as a major inspiration for artificial intelligence and has helped to create in silico systems capable of matching or even outperforming humans in several specific tasks, including visual recognition and strategy-based games. However, the development of human-like robots that are able to move as quickly as humans and respond flexibly in various situations remains a major challenge and indicates an area where further use of parallel and hierarchical architectures may hold promise. In this article we review several important neural and behavioral mechanisms organizing hierarchical and predictive processing for the acquisition and realization of flexible behavioral control. Then, inspired by the organizational features of brain circuits, we introduce a multi-timescale parallel and hierarchical learning framework for the realization of versatile and agile movement in humanoid robots.", "Artificial intelligence (AI)-based applications exhibit the potential to improve the quality and efficiency of patient care in different fields, including cataract management. A systematic review of the different applications of AI-based software on all aspects of a cataract patient's management, from diagnosis to follow-up, was carried out in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. All selected articles were analyzed to assess the level of evidence according to the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine 2011 guidelines, and the quality of evidence according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation system. Of the articles analyzed, 49 met the inclusion criteria. No data synthesis was possible for the heterogeneity of available data and the design of the available studies. The AI-driven diagnosis seemed to be comparable and, in selected cases, to even exceed the accuracy of experienced clinicians in classifying disease, supporting the operating room scheduling, and intraoperative and postoperative management of complications. Considering the heterogeneity of data analyzed, however, further randomized controlled trials to assess the efficacy and safety of AI application in the management of cataract should be highly warranted.", "Recently, artificial intelligence technologies and machine learning methods have offered attractive prospects to design and manage crisis response processes, especially in suicide crisis management. In other domains, most algorithms are based on big data to help diagnose and suggest rational treatment options in medicine. But data in psychiatry are related to behavior and clinical evaluation. They are more heterogeneous, less objective, and incomplete compared to other fields of medicine. Consequently, the use of psychiatric clinical data may lead to less accurate and sometimes impossible-to-build algorithms and provide inefficient digital tools. In this case, the Bayesian network (BN) might be helpful and accurate when constructed from expert knowledge. Medical Companion is a government-funded smartphone application based on repeated questions posed to the subject and algorithm-matched advice to prevent relapse of suicide attempts within several months.\nOur paper aims to present our development of a BN algorithm as a medical device in accordance with the American Psychiatric Association digital healthcare guidelines and to provide results from a preclinical phase.\nThe experts are psychiatrists working in university hospitals who are experienced and trained in managing suicidal crises. As recommended when building a BN, we divided the process into 2 tasks. Task 1 is structure determination, representing the qualitative part of the BN. The factors were chosen for their known and demonstrated link with suicidal risk in the literature (clinical, behavioral, and psychometrics) and therapeutic accuracy (advice). Task 2 is parameter elicitation, with the conditional probabilities corresponding to the quantitative part. The 4-step simulation (use case) process allowed us to ensure that the advice was adapted to the clinical states of patients and the context.\nFor task 1, in this formative part, we defined clinical questions related to the mental state of the patients, and we proposed specific factors related to the questions. Subsequently, we suggested specific advice related to the patient's state. We obtained a structure for the BN with a graphical representation of causal relations between variables. For task 2, several runs of simulations confirmed the a priori model of experts regarding mental state, refining the precision of our model. Moreover, we noticed that the advice had the same distribution as the previous state and was clinically relevant. After 2 rounds of simulation, the experts found the exact match.\nBN is an efficient methodology to build an algorithm for a digital assistant dedicated to suicidal crisis management. Digital psychiatry is an emerging field, but it needs validation and testing before being used with patients. Similar to psychotropics, any medical device requires a phase II (preclinical) trial. With this method, we propose another step to respond to the American Psychiatric Association guidelines.\nClinicalTrials.gov NCT03975881; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03975881.", "In this survey, results from an investigation on collision avoidance and path planning methods developed in recent research are provided. In particular, existing methods based on Artificial Intelligence, data-driven methods based on Machine Learning, and other Data Science approaches are investigated to provide a comprehensive overview of maritime collision avoidance techniques applicable to Maritime Autonomous Surface Ships. Relevant aspects of those methods and approaches are summarized and put into suitable perspectives. As autonomous systems are expected to operate alongside or in place of conventionally manned vessels, they must comply with the COLREGs for robust decision-support/-making. Thus, the survey specifically covers how COLREGs are addressed by the investigated methods and approaches. A conclusion regarding their utilization in industrial implementations is drawn.", "Canines represent a valuable model for mammalian aging studies as large animals with short lifespans, allowing longitudinal analyses within a reasonable time frame. Moreover, they develop a spectrum of aging-related diseases resembling that of humans, are exposed to similar environments, and have been reasonably well studied in terms of physiology and genetics. To overcome substantial variables that complicate studies of privately-owned household dogs, we have focused on a more uniform population composed of retired Alaskan sled dogs that shared similar lifestyles, including exposure to natural stresses, and are less prone to breed-specific biases than a pure breed population. To reduce variability even further, we have collected a population of 103 retired (8-11 years-old) sled dogs from multiple North American kennels in a specialized research facility named Vaika. Vaika dogs are maintained under standardized conditions with professional veterinary care and participate in a multidisciplinary program to assess the longitudinal dynamics of aging. The established Vaika infrastructure enables periodic gathering of quantitative data reflecting physical, physiological, immunological, neurological, and cognitive decline, as well as monitoring of aging-associated genetic and epigenetic alterations occurring in somatic cells. In addition, we assess the development of age-related diseases such as arthritis and cancer. In-depth data analysis, including artificial intelligence-based approaches, will build a comprehensive, integrated model of canine aging and potentially identify aging biomarkers that will allow use of this model for future testing of antiaging therapies.", "Parameterised patient-specific models of the heart enable quantitative analysis of cardiac function as well as estimation of regional stress and intrinsic tissue stiffness. However, the development of personalised models and subsequent simulations have often required lengthy manual setup, from image labelling through to generating the finite element model and assigning boundary conditions. Recently, rapid patient-specific finite element modelling has been made possible through the use of machine learning techniques. In this paper, utilising multiple neural networks for image labelling and detection of valve landmarks, together with streamlined data integration, a pipeline for generating patient-specific biventricular models is applied to clinically-acquired data from a diverse cohort of individuals, including hypertrophic and dilated cardiomyopathy patients and healthy volunteers. Valve motion from tracked landmarks as well as cavity volumes measured from labelled images are used to drive realistic motion and estimate passive tissue stiffness values. The neural networks are shown to accurately label cardiac regions and features for these diverse morphologies. Furthermore, differences in global intrinsic parameters, such as tissue anisotropy and normalised active tension, between groups illustrate respective underlying changes in tissue composition and/or structure as a result of pathology. This study shows the successful application of a generic pipeline for biventricular modelling, incorporating artificial intelligence solutions, within a diverse cohort.", "Chemical reactions of single molecules, caused by rapid formation or breaking of chemical bonds, are difficult to observe even with state-of-the-art instruments. A biological nanopore can be engineered into a single molecule reactor, capable of detecting the binding of a monatomic ion or the transient appearance of chemical intermediates. Pore engineering of this type is however technically challenging, which has significantly restricted further development of this technique. We propose a versatile strategy, \"programmable nano-reactors for stochastic sensing\" (PNRSS), by which a variety of single molecule reactions of hydrogen peroxide, metal ions, ethylene glycol, glycerol, lactic acid, vitamins, catecholamines or nucleoside analogues can be observed directly. PNRSS presents a refined sensing resolution which can be further enhanced by an artificial intelligence algorithm. Remdesivir, a nucleoside analogue and an investigational anti-viral drug used to treat COVID-19, can be distinguished from its active triphosphate form by PNRSS, suggesting applications in pharmacokinetics or drug screening.", "The vast majority of goat skin processed by traditional tanneries comes from small rural producers. Thus, with the predominance of rustic creation, slaughter, and skinning methods, the batches of hides processed by tanneries have a very heterogeneous quality. Thus, there is a need to categorize the samples according to the quantity and location of defects. The categorization process is subjective and strongly influenced by the experience of the professional classifier, causing a lack of homogeneity in the composition of the goat hide lots for sale. Aiming to reduce failures in the categorization of goatskin samples, the authors investigate the application of computer vision and artificial intelligence on a set of previously categorized wet blue goatskin photographic samples. That said, is analyzed the capacity of different classifiers, with different paradigms, in detecting defects in goatskin samples and in categorizing these samples among seven possible quality levels. A hit rate of 95.9% was achieved in detecting defects and 93.3% in categorizing quality levels. The results suggest that the proposed methodology can be used as a decision aid tool in the qualification process of goat leather samples, which can reduce sample labeling errors.", "Laser Capture Microdissection (LCM) uses a laser to isolate, or capture, specific cells of interest in a complex heterogeneous tissue section, under direct microscopic visualization. Recently, there has been a surge of publications using LCM for tissue spatial molecular profiling relevant to a wide range of research topics.\nWe summarize the many advances in tissue Laser Capture Proteomics (LCP) using mass spectrometry for discovery, and protein arrays for signal pathway network mapping. This review emphasizes: a) transition of LCM phosphoproteomics from the lab to the clinic for individualized cancer therapy, and b) the emerging frontier of LCM single cell molecular analysis combining proteomics with genomic, and transcriptomic analysis. The search strategy was based on the combination of MeSH terms with expert refinement.\nLCM is complemented by a rich set of instruments, methodology protocols, and analytical A.I. (artificial intelligence) software for basic and translational research. Resolution is advancing to the tissue single cell level. A vision for the future evolution of LCM is presented. Emerging LCM technology is combining digital and AI guided remote imaging with automation, and telepathology, to a achieve multi-omic profiling that was not previously possible.", "Hearing aid gain and signal processing are based on assumptions about the average user in the average listening environment, but problems may arise when the individual hearing aid user differs from these assumptions in general or specific ways. This article describes how an artificial intelligence (AI) mechanism that operates continuously on input from the user may alleviate such problems by using a type of machine learning known as Bayesian optimization. The basic AI mechanism is described, and studies showing its effects both in the laboratory and in the field are summarized. A crucial fact about the use of this AI is that it generates large amounts of user data that serve as input for scientific understanding as well as for the development of hearing aids and hearing care. Analyses of users' listening environments based on these data show the distribution of activities and intentions in situations where hearing is challenging. Finally, this article demonstrates how further AI-based analyses of the data can drive development.", "In an underprepared and under-resourced digital mental health system, the linkage of health and personal data with Aadhaar, a biometric system that provides a unique identification number to all Indian residents, poses significant privacy risks to individuals seeking mental health care. We discuss the challenges in protecting mental health data privacy due to these emerging digital health technologies.\nUnder the Aadhaar system, biometric and demographic data stored in a central database can pose a significant threat to the data privacy of individuals with potentially stigmatizing conditions such as mental health disorders. The emerging use of artificial intelligence in digital solutions (including health interventions) can further complicate this situation. There is often patient exclusion in the development of artificial intelligence systems in mental health research and clinical practice. Based on Global Data Protection Regulation and other data privacy regulations, this article provides guidelines for mental health policy makers, professionals, technologists, and related health system stakeholders to protect the individual\u2019s data privacy.", "We sought to investigate the cognition of preschoolers in rural China and examine the relationship between dietary diversity and cognition.\nWe performed a cross-sectional survey analysis. In 1334 preschoolers ages 3 to 5, from 26 preschools in two nationally designated poverty counties in Hunan Province in China, we calculated the dietary diversity score (DDS) using a 24-h recall method. To measure children's cognitive ability, we assessed the Working Memory Index and Verbal Comprehension Index on the Mandarin-language version of the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence, Fourth Edition. Multiple linear regression models were used to estimate the association between DDS and cognitive test scores.\nA total of 22% of children had a Working Memory Index that was either extremely low or borderline, and 31% of children had a Verbal Comprehension Index that was either extremely low or borderline. The mean (\u00b1 SD) DDS was 5.65 \u00b1 1.30. Those preschoolers with medium DDS (5 or 6) or high DDS (7 to 9) scored higher on both Working Memory Index-respectively, mean difference (MD), 1.327; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.246-3.901; and MD, 2.067, 95% CI, 0.261-4.641-and Verbal Comprehension Index-MD, 0.168; 95% CI, 0.072-2.135; and MD, 0.398; 95% CI, 0.032-2.137-than did those with low DDS (0 to 4).\nConsuming a more diverse diet may contribute to better cognition in preschoolers. Future research is needed to better understand the possible causal effect of dietary diversity on cognitive development.", "After decades of developments, electron microscopy has become a powerful and irreplaceable tool in understanding the ionic, electrical, mechanical, chemical, and other functional performances of next-generation polymers and soft complexes. The recent progress in electron microscopy of nanostructured polymers and soft assemblies is important for applications in many different fields, including, but not limited to, mesoporous and nanoporous materials, absorbents, membranes, solid electrolytes, battery electrodes, ion- and electron-transporting materials, organic semiconductors, soft robotics, optoelectronic devices, biomass, soft magnetic materials, and pharmaceutical drug design. For synthetic polymers and soft complexes, there are four main characteristics that differentiate them from their inorganic or biomacromolecular counterparts in electron microscopy studies: (1) lower contrast, (2) abundance of light elements, (3) polydispersity or nanomorphological variations, and (4) large changes induced by electron beams. Since 2011, the Center for Nanophase Materials Sciences (CNMS) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory has been working with numerous facility users on nanostructured polymer composites, block copolymers, polymer brushes, conjugated molecules, organic-inorganic hybrid nanomaterials, organic-inorganic interfaces, organic crystals, and other soft complexes. This review crystalizes some of the essential challenges, successes, failures, and techniques during the process in the past ten years. It also presents some outlooks and future expectations on the basis of these works at the intersection of electron microscopy, soft matter, and artificial intelligence. Machine learning is expected to automate and facilitate image processing and information extraction of polymer and soft hybrid nanostructures in aspects such as dose-controlled imaging and structure analysis.", "Children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and specific learning disorder (SLD) generally have difficulties in social cognition and display impairments involving emotion and face and prosody perception and reduced empathy, indicating theory of mind (ToM) impairment. The objective of this work was to assess and compare the executive functions and ToM in children with ADHD and SLD.\nTwenty children diagnosed with ADHD, 20 children diagnosed with SLD, and 20 normal healthy children in the age group of 7 to 15 years, IQ between 90 and 110 (average intelligence) of any gender, were recruited. All participants were assessed using neuropsychological tests of executive functions and ToM.\nSignificant differences were found on early ToM, basic ToM, advanced ToM, and mean scores on ToM inventory between ADHD and control groups (P \u2264 0.001). Similarly, significant differences were found between ADHD and SLD groups on early, basic, advanced, and mean ToM inventory scores (P < 0.001). No significant differences were found between the control and SLD groups on ToM measures. Further, in the ToM task battery, on task D and task G, significant differences were found between the SLD and control groups at P = 0.04 and P = 0.03 respectively. Differences between ADHD and control groups were also statistically significant on task D and task G at P < 0.001 and P = 0.033. Executive functions in the form of set-shifting and response inhibition were significantly poor in the ADHD group and SLD group at P < 0.001 and P < 0.05 levels, respectively, when compared to the control group.\nChildren with ADHD displayed more deficits in the ToM inventory and tasks than children having SLD and healthy children of their similar age and educational background. Executive functions (set-shifting and response inhibition) were poorer in children with ADHD and children with SLD when compared to healthy children of their similar age and educational background.", "Although interest in artificial intelligence (AI) has exploded in recent years and led to the development of numerous commercial and noncommercial algorithms, the process of implementing such tools into day-to-day clinical practice is rarely described in the burgeoning AI literature. In this report, we describe our experience with the successful integration of an AI-enabled mobile x-ray scanner with an FDA-approved algorithm for detecting pneumothoraces into an end-to-end solution capable of extracting, delivering, and prioritizing positive studies within our thoracic radiology clinical workflow. We also detail several sample cases from our AI algorithm and associated PACS workflow in action to highlight key insights from our experience. We hope this report can help inform other radiology enterprises seeking to evaluate and implement AI-related workflow solutions into daily clinical practice.", "The classic prostate cancer (PCa) diagnostic pathway that is based on prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels and the findings of digital rectal examination followed by systematic biopsy has shown multiple limitations. The use of multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) is now widely accepted in men with clinical suspicion for PCa. In addition, clinical information, PSA density, risk calculators, and genomic and other \"omics\" biomarkers are being used to improve risk stratification. On the basis of mpMRI and MRI-targeted biopsies (MRI-TBx), new diagnostic pathways have been established, aiming to improve the limitations of the classic diagnostic approach. However, these pathways still show limitations associated with mpMRI and MRI-TBx. Definitive PCa diagnosis is made on the basis of histopathologic Gleason grading, which has demonstrated an excellent correlation with clinical outcomes. However, Gleason grading is done subjectively by pathologists and involves poor reproducibility, and PCa may have a heterogeneous distribution of histologic patterns. Thus, important discrepancies persist between biopsy tumor grading and final whole-organ pathologic assessment after radical prostatectomy. PCa offers a unique opportunity to establish a real radiologic-pathologic correlation, as whole-mount radical prostatectomy specimens permit a complete spatial relationship with mpMRI. Artificial intelligence is increasingly being applied to radiologic and pathologic images to improve clinical accuracy and efficiency in PCa diagnosis. This review delineates current PCa diagnostic pathways, with a focus on the role of mpMRI, MRI-TBx, and pathologic analysis. An overview of the expected improvements in PCa diagnosis derived from the use of artificial intelligence, integrated radiologic-pathologic systems, and decision support tools for multidisciplinary teams is provided. An invited commentary by Purysko is available online. Online supplemental material is available for this article. \u00a9RSNA, 2021.", "Owing to the market competitiveness and urgent societal need, an optimum speed of drug discovery is an important criterion for successful implementation. Despite the rapid ascent of artificial intelligence and computational and bioanalytical techniques to accelerate drug discovery in big pharma, organic synthesis of privileged scaffolds predicted in silico for in vitro and in vivo studies is still considered as the rate-limiting step. C-H activation is the latest technology added into an organic chemist's toolbox for the rapid construction and late-stage modification of functional molecules to achieve the desired chemical and physical properties. Particularly, elimination of prefunctionalization steps, exceptional functional group tolerance, complexity-to-diversity oriented synthesis, and late-stage functionalization of privileged medicinal scaffolds expand the chemical space. It has immense potential for the rapid synthesis of a library of molecules, structural modification to achieve the required pharmacological properties such as absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, toxicology (ADMET) and attachment of chemical reporters for proteome profiling, metabolite synthesis, etc. for preclinical studies. Although heterocycle synthesis, late-stage drug modification, 18F labelling, methylation, etc. via C-H functionalization have been reviewed from the synthetic standpoint, a general overview of these protocols from medicinal and drug discovery aspects has not been reviewed. In this feature article, we will discuss the recent trends of C-H activation methodologies such as synthesis of medicinal scaffolds through C-H activation/annulation cascade; C-H arylation for sp2-sp2 and sp2-sp3 cross-coupling; C-H borylation/silylation to introduce a functional linchpin for further manipulation; C-H amination for N-heterocycles and hydrogen bond acceptors; C-H fluorination/fluoroalkylation to tune polarity and lipophilicity; C-H methylation: methyl magic in drug discovery; peptide modification and macrocyclization for therapeutics and biologics; fluorescent labelling and radiolabelling for bioimaging; bioconjugation for chemical biology studies; drug-metabolite synthesis for biodistribution and excretion studies; late-stage diversification of drug-molecules to increase efficacy and safety; cutting-edge DNA encoded library synthesis and improved synthesis of drug molecules via C-H activation in medicinal chemistry and drug discovery.", "Visual information displays are typically composed of multiple visualizations that are used to facilitate an understanding of the underlying data. A common example are dashboards, which are frequently used in domains such as finance, process monitoring and business intelligence. However, users may not be aware of existing guidelines and lack expert design knowledge when composing such multi-view visualizations. In this paper, we present semantic snapping, an approach to help non-expert users design effective multi-view visualizations from sets of pre-existing views. When a particular view is placed on a canvas, it is \"aligned\" with the remaining views-not with respect to its geometric layout, but based on aspects of the visual encoding itself, such as how data dimensions are mapped to channels. Our method uses an on-the-fly procedure to detect and suggest resolutions for conflicting, misleading, or ambiguous designs, as well as to provide suggestions for alternative presentations. With this approach, users can be guided to avoid common pitfalls encountered when composing visualizations. Our provided examples and case studies demonstrate the usefulness and validity of our approach.", "Intraoperative hypotension has an adverse impact on postoperative outcomes. However, it is difficult to predict and treat intraoperative hypotension in advance according to individual clinical parameters.\nThe aim of this study was to develop a prediction model to forecast 5-minute intraoperative hypotension based on the weighted average ensemble of individual neural networks, utilizing the biosignals recorded during noncardiac surgery.\nIn this retrospective observational study, arterial waveforms were recorded during noncardiac operations performed between August 2016 and December 2019, at Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, South Korea. We analyzed the arterial waveforms from the big data in the VitalDB repository of electronic health records. We defined 2s hypotension as the moving average of arterial pressure under 65 mmHg for 2 seconds, and intraoperative hypotensive events were defined when the 2s hypotension lasted for at least 60 seconds. We developed an artificial intelligence-enabled process, named short-term event prediction in the operating room (STEP-OP), for predicting short-term intraoperative hypotension.\nThe study was performed on 18,813 subjects undergoing noncardiac surgeries. Deep-learning algorithms (convolutional neural network [CNN] and recurrent neural network [RNN]) using raw waveforms as input showed greater area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) scores (0.698, 95% CI 0.690-0.705 and 0.706, 95% CI 0.698-0.715, respectively) than that of the logistic regression algorithm (0.673, 95% CI 0.665-0.682). STEP-OP performed better and had greater AUPRC values than those of the RNN and CNN algorithms (0.716, 95% CI 0.708-0.723).\nWe developed STEP-OP as a weighted average of deep-learning models. STEP-OP predicts intraoperative hypotension more accurately than the CNN, RNN, and logistic regression models.\nClinicalTrials.gov NCT02914444; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02914444.", "With the exception of a recently published study and the analyses provided in the test manual, structural validity is mostly uninvestigated for the German version of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children - Fifth Edition (WISC-V). Therefore, the main aim of the present study was to examine the latent structure of the 10 WISC-V primary subtests on a bifurcated extended population-representative German standardization sample (N=1,646) by conducting both exploratory (EFA; n=823) and confirmatory (CFA; n=823) factor analyses on the original data. Since no more than one salient subtest loading could be found on the Fluid Reasoning (FR) factor in EFA, results indicated a four-factor rather than a five-factor model solution when the extraction of more than two suggested factors was forced. Likewise, a bifactor model with four group factors was found to be slightly superior in CFA. Variance estimation from both EFA and CFA revealed that the general factor dominantly accounted for most of the subtest variance and construct reliability estimates further supported interpretability of the Full Scale Intelligence Quotient (FSIQ). In both EFA and CFA, most group factors explained rather small proportions of common subtest variance and produced low construct replicability estimates, suggesting that the WISC-V primary indexes were of lower interpretive value and should be evaluated with caution. Clinical interpretation should thus be primarily based on the FSIQ and include a comprehensive analysis of the cognitive profile derived from the WISC-V primary indexes rather than analyses of each single primary index.", "The expansion of the neocortex represents a characteristic event over the course of mammalian evolution. Gyrencephalic mammals that have the larger brains with many folds (gyri and sulci) seem to have acquired higher intelligence, reflective of the enlargement of the neocortical surface area. In this process, germinal layers containing neural stem cells (NSCs) and neural progenitors expanded in number, leading to an increase in the total number of cortical neurons. In this study, we sought to expand neural stem/progenitor cells and enlarge the neocortical surface area by the dual activation of Shh and Notch signaling in transgenic (Tg) mice, promoting the proliferation of neural stem/progenitor cells by the Shh signaling effector while maintaining the undifferentiated state of NSCs by the Notch signaling effector. In the neocortical region of the Tg embryos, NSCs increased in number, and the ventricles, ventricular zone, and neocortical surface area were dramatically expanded. Furthermore, we observed that folds/wrinkles on the neocortical surface were progressively formed, accompanied by the vascular formation. These findings suggest that Shh and Notch signaling may be key regulators of mammalian brain evolution.", "Artificial intelligence, with its increasing data volume, developing technologies, more information processing power and new algorithms, has a wide usage area in all sectors. In the field of health, these technologies is gaining an increasing place every day. Artificial intelligence methods can act as a simulation of the human mind and intelligence, resulting in the analysis and classification of complex data in a short time. Thus, by separating the small differences in the images examined, it can help diagnosis, detect preliminary signs of the disease and predict how the disease will develop. Computer based programs; diagnostic algorithms, surgical support and robotic systems developed on the basis of patient data are increasingly used in the drug development industry. In this study, artificial intelligence applications in the field of health and its use in pulmonology, the place of wearable technologies in our department and the advantages they provide us during the pandemic period were discussed in the light of the literature.", "3M syndrome is characterized by severe pre- and post-natal growth restriction, typical face, slender tubular bones, tall vertebral bodies, prominent heels and normal intelligence. It is caused by biallelic variants of CUL7, OBSL1 and, more rarely, CCDC8. The aim of this study is to evaluate facial and skeletal findings in 3M patients from neonatal period to adulthood. A total of 19 patients with a median age of diagnosis of 9.2 months were included in this study and were followed for two to 20 years. CUL7 and OBSL1 variants were found in 57.9% and 42.1% of patients, respectively, five of which are novel. Most of patients had triangular face, frontal bossing, short fleshy nose, full fleshy lower lip, transverse groove of rib cage, hyperlordosis and prominent heels. Three new early-diagnostic signs were observed in infants; two were infraorbital swelling of the lower lid and facial infantile hemangioma, both of which became less pronounced with aging. The third was the central tubercle of the upper lip that became more prominent with in time. While slender long bones did not change with aging, the tall vertebral bodies became more prominent radiologically. The mean birth length in patients was -4.3 SDS. Eight patients reached a mean final height of -4.9 SDS. Despite described growth hormone (GH) insensitivity in 3M syndrome, 12 patients either with GH deficiency or with normal GH levels were treated with GH; seven patients responded with an increase in height SDS. This study not only provided early diagnostic signs of the syndrome, but also presented important follow-up findings.", "Studies from high-income countries report associations of preeclampsia (PE) with reduced cognitive function and adverse behavioural outcomes in children. We examined these associations in Indian children aged 5-7 years. Children of mothers with PE (n=74) and without PE (non-PE; n=234) were recruited at delivery at Bharati Hospital, Pune, India. The cognitive performance was assessed using 3 core tests from the Kaufman Assessment Battery and additional tests including Verbal fluency, Kohs block design, and Coding A (from Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children). The parent-reported Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) was used to assess children's behavioral characteristics. Scores were compared between children from PE and non-PE groups, and associations analyzed further using regression models, adjusted for potential confounders. After adjusting for age, sex, socio-economic status and maternal education, children of PE mothers had lower Kohs block design scores (adjusted odds ratio per score category 0.57, [95% CI 0.34-0.96] p=0.034; 0.62 [95%CI (0.36, 1.07), p=0.09 on further adjustment for birth weight and gestation) compared to children of mothers without PE. In the SDQ, there was a lower prevalence of abnormal 'conduct problem' scores in PE group than non-PE group (OR=0.33, 95% CI 0.13-0.83, p=0.018, in the fully adjusted model); there were no differences for other behavioral domains. This preliminary study in Indian children suggests that fetal exposure to maternal PE may have an adverse impact on visuo-spatial performance but does not adversely affect behavior. Further studies with larger sample sizes are essential to understand effects of maternal PE on cognitive/behavioral outcomes in children.", "The first cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\u201119) were reported in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Five months later, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced a pandemic. The symptoms are nonspecific, and include breathing difficulties, cough, fever, and the loss of smell and taste. The diagnosis is confirmed by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing. Medical imaging has been mainly used to estimate the range of disease or potential complications.The aim of this study was to present the radiographic features of COVID\u201119 reported in published papers. This investigation includes the scientific work concerning chest radiography (chest X-ray - CXR) and computed tomography (CT) in COVID\u201119 patients. The most common pathologies are described, and the classification of COVID\u201119 appearance in CT and other radiology reports is summarized. The usage of lung ultrasound (LUS) was taken into consideration. This study emphasizes the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in the COVID\u201119 pandemic. The algorithms developed to detect the disease are discussed. The role of medical imaging is not limited to the respiratory system; it can also be used in searching for and monitoring complications (cardiac, vascular or brain damage). Due to the significant role of radiology in the current pandemic, a review of the latest medical literature was performed to help clarify the upcoming data.", "This scoping review aims to provide a broad overview of the applications of artificial intelligence (AI) to office laryngoscopy to identify gaps in knowledge and guide future research.\nScoping Review.\nSearches for studies on AI and office laryngoscopy were conducted in five databases. Title and abstract and then full-text screening were performed. Primary research studies published in English of any date were included. Studies were summarized by: AI applications, targeted conditions, imaging modalities, author affiliations, and dataset characteristics.\nStudies focused on vocal fold vibration analysis (43%), lesion recognition (24%), and vocal fold movement determination (19%). The most frequently automated tasks were recognition of vocal fold nodules (19%), polyp (14%), paralysis (11%), paresis (8%), and cyst (7%). Imaging modalities included high-speed laryngeal videos (45%), stroboscopy (29%), and narrow band imaging endoscopy (7%). The body of literature was primarily authored by science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) specialists (76%) with only 30 studies (31%) involving co-authorship by STEM specialists and otolaryngologists. Datasets were mostly from single institution (84%) and most commonly originated from Germany (23%), USA (16%), Spain (9%), Italy (8%), and China (8%). Demographic information was only reported in 39 studies (40%), with age and sex being the most commonly reported, whereas race/ethnicity and gender were not reported in any studies.\nMore interdisciplinary collaboration between STEM and otolaryngology research teams improved demographic reporting especially of race and ethnicity to ensure broad representation, and larger and more geographically diverse datasets will be crucial to future research on AI in office laryngoscopy.\nNA Laryngoscope, 132:1993-2016, 2022.", "The analog methods used in the clinical assessment of the patient's chronological age are subjective and characterized by low accuracy. When using those methods, there is a noticeable discrepancy between the chronological age and the age estimated based on relevant scientific studies. Innovations in the field of information technology are increasingly used in medicine, with particular emphasis on artificial intelligence methods. The paper presents research aimed at developing a new, effective methodology for the assessment of the chronological age using modern IT methods. In this paper, a study was conducted to determine the features of pantomographic images that support the determination of metric age, and neural models were produced to support the process of identifying the age of children and adolescents. The whole conducted work was a new methodology of metric age assessment. The result of the conducted study is a set of 21 original indicators necessary for the assessment of the chronological age with the use of computer image analysis and neural modelling, as well as three non-linear models of radial basis function networks (RBF), whose accuracy ranges from 96 to 99%. The result of the research are three neural models that determine the chronological age.", "Radiomics and genomics represent two of the most promising fields of cancer research, designed to improve the risk stratification and disease management of patients with prostate cancer (PCa). Radiomics involves a conversion of imaging derivate quantitative features using manual or automated algorithms, enhancing existing data through mathematical analysis. This could increase the clinical value in PCa management. To extract features from imaging methods such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the empiric nature of the analysis using machine learning and artificial intelligence could help make the best clinical decisions. Genomics information can be explained or decoded by radiomics. The development of methodologies can create more-efficient predictive models and can better characterize the molecular features of PCa. Additionally, the identification of new imaging biomarkers can overcome the known heterogeneity of PCa, by non-invasive radiological assessment of the whole specific organ. In the future, the validation of recent findings, in large, randomized cohorts of PCa patients, can establish the role of radiogenomics. Briefly, we aimed to review the current literature of highly quantitative and qualitative results from well-designed studies for the diagnoses, treatment, and follow-up of prostate cancer, based on radiomics, genomics and radiogenomics research.", "Illicit drug profiling bears a long history. Developments in the field from mid-90s have led to several international profiling programs. Several countries have put their efforts to develop and implement the routine use of illicit drug profiling in the investigation and prosecution of illicit drug-related crimes. For more than 20\u2009years, the School of Criminal Sciences (ESC) at the University of Lausanne has, through its illicit drug expertise laboratory, played a main role in promoting the use of illicit drug profiling. In Switzerland, there is no national illicit drug profiling practice and the ESC laboratory is the only one offering such service. However, only a limited number of Swiss jurisdictions send regularly all or part of their seized specimens for analysis to the ESC laboratory. Profiling results are furnished to investigators and prosecutors regardless if they have been requested or not and are stored in a database with limited contextual information with no further data treatment. In 2020, the interruption of a project intended to develop and implement an intercantonal database gathering traditional police data, forensic data (e.g., DNA, fingerprints, etc.), and physical and chemical links, to produce intelligence and support investigation, led to the fundamental question: Is illicit drug profiling in Switzerland condemned to disappear or is it a forgotten treasure, a neglected approach that deserves to be revalued? This paper reports the Swiss situation regarding illicit drug profiling practices and discusses some factors that are thought to impact its use in day-to-day work.", "Upon the eruption of COVID-19, frontline health-care workers confronted substantial workload and stress along with braving additional difficulties when performing at work. The main aim of this research was to assess the mediating role of work engagement in the direct impact of emotional intelligence on health-care professionals' work performance. A cross-sectional study was conducted in several Spanish hospitals during the second half of 2020. A total of 1549 health-care workers (62.1% women; mean age 36.51 years) filled the Wong and Law Emotional Intelligence Scale, the Utrecht Work Engagement Scale and the Individual Work Performance Questionnaire. Our findings demonstrated that work engagement plays a mediating effect between emotional intelligence and work performance, even when accounting for sociodemographic variables. Indeed, among the three constructs of engagement, vigor dimension (a1b1 = 0.09; CI: 0.06; 0.12; p < 0.01) emerges over dedication (a2b2 = 0.083; CI = 0.05, 0.1; p < 0.01) and absorption (a3b3 = 0.047; CI = 0.02, 0.07; p < 0.01) as the most decisive one. Herewith, it is apparent that professionals with a higher self-perception of emotional intelligence report stronger levels of engagement, thereby leading to greater performance overall. The present work evinces the necessity for proactively developing the emotional competencies of the health-care workforce, especially in high-emotional demand contexts.", "The purpose of this study is to develop and validate the intelligent diagnosis of severe DR with lesion recognition based on color fundus photography.\nThe Kaggle public dataset for DR grading is used in the project, including 53,576 fundus photos in the test set, 28,101 in the training set, and 7,025 in the validation set. We randomly select 4,192 images for lesion annotation. Inception V3 structure is adopted as the classification algorithm. Both 299\u2009\u00d7\u2009299 pixel images and 896\u2009\u00d7\u2009896 pixel images are used as the input size. ROC curve, AUC, sensitivity, specificity, and their harmonic mean are used to evaluate the performance of the models.\nThe harmonic mean and AUC of the model of 896\u2009\u00d7\u2009896 input are higher than those of the 299\u2009\u00d7\u2009299 input model. The sensitivity, specificity, harmonic mean, and AUC of the method with 896\u2009\u00d7\u2009896 resolution images as input for severe DR are 0.925, 0.907, 0.916, and 0.968, respectively. The prediction error mainly occurs in moderate NPDR, and cases with more hard exudates and cotton wool spots are easily predicted as severe cases. Cases with preretinal hemorrhage and vitreous hemorrhage are easily identified as severe cases, and IRMA is the most difficult lesion to recognize.\nWe have studied the intelligent diagnosis of severe DR based on color fundus photography. This artificial intelligence-based technology offers a possibility to increase the accessibility and efficiency of severe DR screening.", "The selection of nanofillers and compatibilizing agents, and their size and concentration, are always considered to be crucial in the design of durable nanobiocomposites with maximized mechanical properties (i.e., fracture strength (FS), yield strength (YS), Young's modulus (YM), etc). Therefore, the statistical optimization of the key design factors has become extremely important to minimize the experimental runs and the cost involved. In this study, both statistical (i.e., analysis of variance (ANOVA) and response surface methodology (RSM)) and machine learning techniques (i.e., artificial intelligence-based techniques (i.e., artificial neural network (ANN) and genetic algorithm (GA)) were used to optimize the concentrations of nanofillers and compatibilizing agents of the injection-molded HDPE nanocomposites. Initially, through ANOVA, the concentrations of TiO2 and cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) and their combinations were found to be the major factors in improving the durability of the HDPE nanocomposites. Further, the data were modeled and predicted using RSM, ANN, and their combination with a genetic algorithm (i.e., RSM-GA and ANN-GA). Later, to minimize the risk of local optimization, an ANN-GA hybrid technique was implemented in this study to optimize multiple responses, to develop the nonlinear relationship between the factors (i.e., the concentration of TiO2 and CNCs) and responses (i.e., FS, YS, and YM), with minimum error and with regression values above 95%.", "This article details ways that machine learning and artificial intelligence technologies are being integrated in modern hearing aids to improve speech understanding in background noise and provide a gateway to overall health and wellness. Discussion focuses on how Starkey incorporates automatic and user-driven optimization of speech intelligibility with onboard hearing aid signal processing and machine learning algorithms, smartphone-based deep neural network processing, and wireless hearing aid accessories. The article will conclude with a review of health and wellness tracking capabilities that are enabled by embedded sensors and artificial intelligence.", "The COVID-19 global pandemic caused by the widespread transmission of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has become one of modern history's most challenging issues from a healthcare perspective. At its dawn, still without a vaccine, contagion containment strategies remained most effective in preventing the disease's spread. Patient isolation has been primarily driven by the results of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing, but its initial reach was challenged by low availability and high cost, especially in developing countries. As a means of taking advantage of a preexisting infrastructure for respiratory disease diagnosis, researchers have proposed COVID-19 patient screening based on the results of Chest Computerized Tomography (CT) and Chest Radiographs (X-ray). When paired with artificial-intelligence- and deep-learning-based approaches for analysis, early studies have achieved a comparatively high accuracy in diagnosing the disease. Considering the opportunity to further explore these methods, we implement six different Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (Deep CNN) models-VGG16, MobileNetV2, InceptionResNetV2, ResNet50, ResNet101, and VGG19-and use a mixed dataset of CT and X-ray images to classify COVID-19 patients. Preliminary results showed that a modified MobileNetV2 model performs best with an accuracy of 95 \u00b1 1.12% (AUC = 0.816). Notably, a high performance was also observed for the VGG16 model, outperforming several previously proposed models with an accuracy of 98.5 \u00b1 1.19% on the X-ray dataset. Our findings are supported by recent works in the academic literature, which also uphold the higher performance of MobileNetV2 when X-ray, CT, and their mixed datasets are considered. Lastly, we further explain the process of feature extraction using Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME), which contributes to a better understanding of what features in CT/X-ray images characterize the onset of COVID-19.", "The development of convolutional neural networks has achieved impressive advances of machine learning in recent years, leading to an increasing use of artificial intelligence (AI) in the field of gastrointestinal (GI) diseases. AI networks have been trained to differentiate benign from malignant lesions, analyze endoscopic and radiological GI images, and assess histological diagnoses, obtaining excellent results and high overall diagnostic accuracy. Nevertheless, there data are lacking on side effects of AI in the gastroenterology field, and high-quality studies comparing the performance of AI networks to health care professionals are still limited. Thus, large, controlled trials in real-time clinical settings are warranted to assess the role of AI in daily clinical practice. This narrative review gives an overview of some of the most relevant potential applications of AI for gastrointestinal diseases, highlighting advantages and main limitations and providing considerations for future development.", "Protein amino acid sequences can be used to determine the functions of the protein. However, determining the function of a single protein requires many resources and a tremendous amount of time. Computational Intelligence methods such as Deep learning have been shown to predict the proteins' functions. This paper proposes a hybrid deep neural network model to predict an unknown protein's functions from sequences. The proposed model is named Deep_CNN_LSTM_GO. Deep_CNN_LSTM_GO is an Integration between Convolutional Neural network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Neural Network to learn features from amino acid sequences and outputs the three different Gene Ontology (GO). The gene ontology represents the protein functions in the three sub-ontologies: Molecular Functions (MF), Biological Process (BP), and Cellular Component (CC). The proposed model has been trained and tested using UniProt-SwissProt's dataset. Another test has been done using Computational Assessment of Function Annotation (CAFA) on the three sub-ontologies. The proposed model outperforms different methods proposed in the field with better performance using three different evaluation metrics (Fmax, Smin, and AUPR) in the three sub-ontologies (MF, BP, CC).", "The Protecting Access to Medicare Act mandates clinical decision support (CDS) at imaging order entry, necessitating the use of structured indications to map CDS scores. We evaluated the performance of a commercially available artificial intelligence (AI) tool leveraging free-text order entry to facilitate provider selection of the necessary structured indications.\nOur institution implemented an AI tool offering predicted structured indications based upon the ordering provider's entry of a free-text reason for examination. Providers remained able to order via the traditional direct search for structured indications. Alternatively, they could take the new free-text-AI approach allowing them to select from AI-predicted indications, perform additional direct searches, indicate no matching indication, or exit CDS workflow. We hypothesized the free-text-AI approach would be elected more often and the AI tool would be successful in facilitating selection of structured indications. We reviewed advanced imaging orders (n\u00a0= 40,053) for the first 3 months (February to May 2020) since implementation.\nProviders were more likely (P < .001) to choose the free-text-AI approach (23,580; 58.9%) to order entry over direct search for structured indications (16,473; 41.1%). The AI tool yielded alerts with predicted indications in 91.7% (n\u00a0= 21,631) of orders with free text. Ultimately, providers chose AI-predicted indications in 57.7% (n\u00a0= 12,490) of cases in which they were offered by the tool.\nProviders significantly more often elected the new free-text-AI approach to order entry for CDS, suggesting provider preference over the traditional approach. The AI tool commonly predicted indications acceptable to ordering providers.", "Artificial intelligence can help physicians improve the accuracy of breast cancer diagnosis. However, the effectiveness of AI applications is limited by doctors' adoption of the results recommended by the personalized medical decision support system. Our primary purpose is to study the impact of external case characteristics (ECC) on the effectiveness of the personalized medical decision support system for breast cancer assisted diagnosis (PMDSS-BCAD) in making accurate recommendations. Therefore, we designed a novel comprehensive framework for case-based reasoning (CBR) that takes the impact of external features of cases into account, made use of the naive Bayes and k-nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithms (CBR-ECC), and developed a PMDSS-BCAD system by using the CBR-ECC model and external features as system components. Under the new case-based reasoning framework, the accuracy of the combined model of naive Bayes and KNN with an optimal K value of 2 is 99.40%. Moreover, in a real hospital scenario, users rated the PMDSS-BCAD system, which takes into account the external characteristics of the case, better than the original personalized system. These results suggest that PMDSS-BCD can not only provide doctors with more personalized and accurate results for auxiliary diagnosis, but also improve doctors' trust in the results, so as to encourage doctors to adopt the results recommended by the personalized system.", "As Artificial Intelligence (AI) continues to expand its reach, the demand for human control and the development of AI systems that adhere to our legal, ethical, and social values also grows. Many (international and national) institutions have taken steps in this direction and published guidelines for the development and deployment of responsible AI systems. These guidelines, however, rely heavily on high-level statements that provide no clear criteria for system assessment, making the effective control over systems a challenge. \"Human oversight\" is one of the requirements being put forward as a means to support human autonomy and agency. In this paper, we argue that human presence alone does not meet this requirement and that such a misconception may limit the use of automation where it can otherwise provide so much benefit across industries. We therefore propose the development of systems with variable autonomy-dynamically adjustable levels of autonomy-as a means of ensuring meaningful human control over an artefact by satisfying all three core values commonly advocated in ethical guidelines: accountability, responsibility, and transparency.", "It is important to use outcome measures for novel interventions in Alzheimer's disease (AD) that capture the research participants' views of effectiveness. The electronic Person-Specific Outcome Measure (ePSOM) development programme is underpinned by the need to identify and detect change in early disease manifestations and the possibilities of incorporating artificial intelligence in outcome measures.\nThe aim of the ePSOM programme is to better understand what outcomes matter to patients in the AD population with a focus on those at the pre-dementia stages of disease. Ultimately, we aim to develop an app with robust psychometric properties to be used as a patient reported outcome measure in AD clinical trials.\nWe designed and ran a nationwide study (Aug 2019 - Nov 2019, UK), collecting primarily free text responses in five pre-defined domains. We collected self-reported clinical details and sociodemographic data to analyse responses by key variables whilst keeping the survey short (around 15 minutes). We used clustering and Natural Language Processing techniques to identify themes which matter most to individuals when developing new treatments for AD.\nThe study was completed by 5,808 respondents, yielding over 80,000 free text answers. The analysis resulted in 184 themes of importance. An analysis focusing on key demographics to explore how priorities differed by age, gender and education revealed that there are significant differences in what groups consider important about their brain health.\nThe ePSOM data has generated evidence on what matters to people when developing new treatments for AD that target secondary prevention and therein maintenance of brain health. These results will form the basis for an electronic outcome measure to be used in AD clinical research and clinical practice.", "Assessment in the Education system plays a significant role in judging student performance. The present evaluation system is through human assessment. As the number of teachers' student ratio is gradually increasing, the manual evaluation process becomes complicated. The drawback of manual evaluation is that it is time-consuming, lacks reliability, and many more. This connection online examination system evolved as an alternative tool for pen and paper-based methods. Present Computer-based evaluation system works only for multiple-choice questions, but there is no proper evaluation system for grading essays and short answers. Many researchers are working on automated essay grading and short answer scoring for the last few decades, but assessing an essay by considering all parameters like the relevance of the content to the prompt, development of ideas, Cohesion, and Coherence is a big challenge till now. Few researchers focused on Content-based evaluation, while many of them addressed style-based assessment. This paper provides a systematic literature review on automated essay scoring systems. We studied the Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning techniques used to evaluate automatic essay scoring and analyzed the limitations of the current studies and research trends. We observed that the essay evaluation is not done based on the relevance of the content and coherence.\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s10462-021-10068-2.", "Hearing aids continue to acquire increasingly sophisticated sound-processing features beyond basic amplification. On the one hand, these have the potential to add user benefit and allow for personalization. On the other hand, if such features are to benefit according to their potential, they require clinicians to be acquainted with both the underlying technologies and the specific fitting handles made available by the individual hearing aid manufacturers. Ensuring benefit from hearing aids in typical daily listening environments requires that the hearing aids handle sounds that interfere with communication, generically referred to as \"noise.\" With this aim, considerable efforts from both academia and industry have led to increasingly advanced algorithms that handle noise, typically using the principles of directional processing and postfiltering. This article provides an overview of the techniques used for noise reduction in modern hearing aids. First, classical techniques are covered as they are used in modern hearing aids. The discussion then shifts to how deep learning, a subfield of artificial intelligence, provides a radically different way of solving the noise problem. Finally, the results of several experiments are used to showcase the benefits of recent algorithmic advances in terms of signal-to-noise ratio, speech intelligibility, selective attention, and listening effort.", "Continuous and emerging advances in Information and Communication Technology (ICT) have enabled Internet-of-Things (IoT)-to-Cloud applications to be induced by data pipelines and Edge Intelligence-based architectures. Advanced vehicular networks greatly benefit from these architectures due to the implicit functionalities that are focused on realizing the Internet of Vehicle (IoV) vision. However, IoV is susceptible to attacks, where adversaries can easily exploit existing vulnerabilities. Several attacks may succeed due to inadequate or ineffective authentication techniques. Hence, there is a timely need for hardening the authentication process through cutting-edge access control mechanisms. This paper proposes a Blockchain-based Multi-Factor authentication model that uses an embedded Digital Signature (MFBC_eDS) for vehicular clouds and Cloud-enabled IoV. Our proposed MFBC_eDS model consists of a scheme that integrates the Security Assertion Mark-up Language (SAML) to the Single Sign-On (SSO) capabilities for a connected edge to cloud ecosystem. MFBC_eDS draws an essential comparison with the baseline authentication scheme suggested by Karla and Sood. Based on the foundations of Karla and Sood's scheme, an embedded Probabilistic Polynomial-Time Algorithm (ePPTA) and an additional Hash function for the Pi generated during Karla and Sood's authentication were proposed and discussed. The preliminary analysis of the proposition shows that the approach is more suitable to counter major adversarial attacks in an IoV-centered environment based on the Dolev-Yao adversarial model while satisfying aspects of the Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA) triad.", "An artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted contouring system benefits radiation oncologists by saving time and improving treatment accuracy. Yet, there is much hope and fear surrounding such technologies, and this fear can manifest as resistance from health care professionals, which can lead to the failure of AI projects.\nThe objective of this study was to develop and test a model for investigating the factors that drive radiation oncologists' acceptance of AI contouring technology in a Chinese context.\nA model of AI-assisted contouring technology acceptance was developed based on the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model by adding the variables of perceived risk and resistance that were proposed in this study. The model included 8 constructs with 29 questionnaire items. A total of 307 respondents completed the questionnaires. Structural equation modeling was conducted to evaluate the model's path effects, significance, and fitness.\nThe overall fitness indices for the model were evaluated and showed that the model was a good fit to the data. Behavioral intention was significantly affected by performance expectancy (\u03b2=.155; P=.01), social influence (\u03b2=.365; P<.001), and facilitating conditions (\u03b2=.459; P<.001). Effort expectancy (\u03b2=.055; P=.45), perceived risk (\u03b2=-.048; P=.35), and resistance bias (\u03b2=-.020; P=.63) did not significantly affect behavioral intention.\nThe physicians' overall perceptions of an AI-assisted technology for radiation contouring were high. Technology resistance among Chinese radiation oncologists was low and not related to behavioral intention. Not all of the factors in the Venkatesh UTAUT model applied to AI technology adoption among physicians in a Chinese context.", "Physician review websites have significant influence on a patient's selection of a provider, but written reviews are subjective. Sentiment analysis of writing through artificial intelligence can quantify surgeon reviews to provide actionable feedback. The objective of this study is to quantitatively analyze the written reviews of members of the Scoliosis Research Society (SRS) through sentiment analysis.\nOnline written reviews and star-rating reviews of SRS surgeons were obtained from healthgrades.com, and a sentiment analysis package was used to obtain compound scores of each physician's reviews. A t test and ANOVA was performed to determine the relationship between demographic variables and average sentiment score of written reviews. Positive and negative word and word-pair frequency analysis was performed to provide context to words used to describe surgeons.\nSeven hundred and twenty-one SRS surgeon's reviews were analyzed. Analysis showed a positive correlation between the sentiment scores and overall average star-rated reviews (r2\u2009=\u20090.5, p\u2009<\u20090.01). There was no difference in review sentiment by provider gender. However, the age of surgeons showed a significant difference as younger surgeons, on average, had more positive reviews (p\u2009<\u20090.01).\nThe most frequently used word pairs used to describe top-rated surgeons describe compassionate providers and efficiency in pain management. Conversely, those with the worst reviews are characterized as unable to relieve pain. Through quantitative analysis of physician reviews, pain is a clear factor contributing to both positive and negative reviews of surgeons, reinforcing the need to properly manage pain expectations.\nIV.", "Knowing metastasis is the primary cause of cancer-related deaths, incentivized research directed towards unraveling the complex cellular processes that drive the metastasis. Advancement in technology and specifically the advent of high-throughput sequencing provides knowledge of such processes. This knowledge led to the development of therapeutic and clinical applications, and is now being used to predict the onset of metastasis to improve diagnostics and disease therapies. In this regard, predicting metastasis onset has also been explored using artificial intelligence approaches that are machine learning, and more recently, deep learning-based. This review summarizes the different machine learning and deep learning-based metastasis prediction methods developed to date. We also detail the different types of molecular data used to build the models and the critical signatures derived from the different methods. We further highlight the challenges associated with using machine learning and deep learning methods, and provide suggestions to improve the predictive performance of such methods.", "Background Previous studies suggest that use of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms as diagnostic aids may improve the quality of skeletal age assessment, though these studies lack evidence from clinical practice. Purpose To compare the accuracy and interpretation time of skeletal age assessment on hand radiograph examinations with and without the use of an AI algorithm as a diagnostic aid. Materials and Methods In this prospective randomized controlled trial, the accuracy of skeletal age assessment on hand radiograph examinations was performed with (n = 792) and without (n = 739) the AI algorithm as a diagnostic aid. For examinations with the AI algorithm, the radiologist was shown the AI interpretation as part of their routine clinical work and was permitted to accept or modify it. Hand radiographs were interpreted by 93 radiologists from six centers. The primary efficacy outcome was the mean absolute difference between the skeletal age dictated into the radiologists' signed report and the average interpretation of a panel of four radiologists not using a diagnostic aid. The secondary outcome was the interpretation time. A linear mixed-effects regression model with random center- and radiologist-level effects was used to compare the two experimental groups. Results Overall mean absolute difference was lower when radiologists used the AI algorithm compared with when they did not (5.36 months vs 5.95 months; P = .04). The proportions at which the absolute difference exceeded 12 months (9.3% vs 13.0%, P = .02) and 24 months (0.5% vs 1.8%, P = .02) were lower with the AI algorithm than without it. Median radiologist interpretation time was lower with the AI algorithm than without it (102 seconds vs 142 seconds, P = .001). Conclusion Use of an artificial intelligence algorithm improved skeletal age assessment accuracy and reduced interpretation times for radiologists, although differences were observed between centers.

Its symptoms include metamorphopsia, blurred vision, and decreased visual acuity. Early diagnosis and timely treatment of ERM is crucial to preventing vision loss. Although optical coherence tomography (OCT) is regarded as a de facto standard for ERM diagnosis due to its intuitiveness and high sensitivity, ophthalmoscopic examination or fundus photographs still have the advantages of price and accessibility. Artificial intelligence (AI) has been widely applied in the health care industry for its robust and significant performance in detecting various diseases. In this study, we validated the use of a previously trained deep neural network based-AI model in ERM detection based on color fundus photographs. An independent test set of fundus photographs was labeled by a group of ophthalmologists according to their corresponding OCT images as the gold standard. Then the test set was interpreted by other ophthalmologists and AI model without knowing their OCT results. Compared with manual diagnosis based on fundus photographs alone, the AI model had comparable accuracy (AI model 77.08% vs. integrated manual diagnosis 75.69%, \u03c72\u2009=\u20090.038, P\u2009=\u20090.845, McNemar's test), higher sensitivity (75.90% vs. 63.86%, \u03c72\u2009=\u20094.500, P\u2009=\u20090.034, McNemar's test), under the cost of lower but reasonable specificity (78.69% vs. 91.80%, \u03c72\u2009=\u20096.125, P\u2009=\u20090.013, McNemar's test). Thus our AI model can serve as a possible alternative for manual diagnosis in ERM screening.", "This study investigated the relationships of four executive functioning skills (including verbal working memory, spatial working memory, inhibitory control, and cognitive flexibility) with young children's mental computation and applied mathematical problem-solving. Two hundred and twenty-five Chinese kindergarteners were tested with a battery of general cognitive, executive functioning and mathematics skills. Results showed that when children's age, gender, non-verbal intelligence, and listening comprehension skills were controlled, verbal working memory and cognitive flexibility were significant correlates of mental computation, whereas verbal working memory, spatial working memory, and cognitive flexibility were significant correlates of applied mathematical problem-solving. Inhibitory control was not significantly associated with the two domains of mathematics under investigation. The findings highlight the differential roles of different executive functioning skills in early mathematical skills and offer practical implication for helping young children in learning complex mathematical skills.", "There is recent evidence for a domain-general object recognition ability, called O, which is distinct from general intelligence and other cognitive and personality constructs. We extend the study of O by characterizing how it generalizes to the ability to recognize familiar objects and to the ability to make judgments of the average identity of ensembles of objects. We applied latent variable modeling to data collected from a sample of adults (N = 284) in three different tasks and for six different object domains (three novel and three familiar). The results replicated prior work in finding that on average 88% of the variance of lower-order factors could be accounted by O for novel objects. The latent constructs recruited by the higher-order factor for novel objects and for familiar objects were almost perfectly correlated and therefore functionally identical. A latent factor for ensemble perception shared about 42% of the variance with O, suggesting at least strong overlap between abilities supporting judgments about individual objects and ensemble of objects. This work extends the theoretical reach of O by showing generalization across two dimensions (familiar vs. novel objects; individual vs. ensemble object perception). With respect to the structure of individual differences in high-level vision, researchers would benefit from accounting for the contribution of O when seeking to understand various domain-specific abilities.

Patients were divided into mild (n = 12), moderate (n = 31), and severe (n = 8) groups based on clinical severity. An AI-based quantitative CT analysis, including lung volume, opacity score, opacity volume, percentage of opacity, and mean lung density, was performed in initial and follow-up CTs obtained at different time points. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was performed to find the diagnostic ability of quantitative CT parameters for discriminating severe from nonsevere pneumonia.\nIn baseline assessment, the severe group had significantly higher opacity score, opacity volume, higher percentage of opacity, and higher mean lung density than the moderate group (all P \u2264 0.001). Through consecutive time points, the severe group had a significant decrease in lung volume (P = 0.006), a significant increase in total opacity score (P = 0.003), and percentage of opacity (P = 0.007). A significant increase in total opacity score was also observed for the mild group (P = 0.011). Residual opacities were observed in all groups. The involvement of more than 4 lobes (sensitivity, 100%; specificity, 65.26%), total opacity score greater than 4 (sensitivity, 100%; specificity, 64.21), total opacity volume greater than 337.4 mL (sensitivity, 80.95%; specificity, 84.21%), percentage of opacity greater than 11% (sensitivity, 80.95%; specificity, 88.42%), total high opacity volume greater than 10.5 mL (sensitivity, 95.24%; specificity, 66.32%), percentage of high opacity greater than 0.8% (sensitivity, 85.71%; specificity, 80.00%) and mean lung density HU greater than -705 HU (sensitivity, 57.14%; specificity, 90.53%) were related to severe pneumonia.\nAn AI-based quantitative CT analysis is an objective tool in demonstrating disease severity and can also assist the clinician in follow-up by providing information about the disease course and prognosis according to different clinical severity groups.", "Multiple-view visualization (MV) has been heavily used in visual analysis tools for sensemaking of data in various domains (e.g., bioinformatics, cybersecurity and text analytics). One common task of visual analysis with multiple views is to relate data across different views. For example, to identify threats, an intelligence analyst needs to link people from a social network graph with locations on a crime-map, and then search for and read relevant documents. Currently, exploring cross-view data relationships heavily relies on view-coordination techniques (e.g., brushing and linking), which may require significant user effort on many trial-and-error attempts, such as repetitiously selecting elements in one view, and then observing and following elements highlighted in other views. To address this, we present SightBi, a visual analytics approach for supporting cross-view data relationship explorations. We discuss the design rationale of SightBi in detail, with identified user tasks regarding the use of cross-view data relationships. SightBi formalizes cross-view data relationships as biclusters, computes them from a dataset, and uses a bi-context design that highlights creating stand-alone relationship-views. This helps preserve existing views and offers an overview of cross-view data relationships to guide user exploration. Moreover, SightBi allows users to interactively manage the layout of multiple views by using newly created relationship-views. With a usage scenario, we demonstrate the usefulness of SightBi for sensemaking of cross-view data relationships.", "Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is a common syndrome in elderly people. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, in particular machine-learning algorithms, have been increasingly used in disease diagnosis.\nIn this study, we designed an effective diagnostic model of PAD in the elderly\u00a0patients using artificial intelligence.\nThe study was performed with 539 participants, all over 80\u00a0years in age, who underwent the measurements of Doppler ultrasonography and ankle-brachial pressure index (ABI). Blood samples were collected. ABI and two machine-learning algorithms (MLAs)-logistic regression and a random forest (RF) model-were established to diagnose PAD. The sensitivity and specificity of the models were analyzed. An additional RF model was designed based on the most significant features of the original RF model and a prospective study was conducted to demonstrate its external validity.\nThirteen of the 28 features introduced to the MLAs differed significantly between PAD and non-PAD participants. The respective sensitivities and specificities of logistic regression, RF, and ABI were as follows: logistic regression (81.5%, 83.8%), RF (89.3%, 91.6%) and ABI (85.1%, 84.5%). In the prospective study, the newly designed RF model based on the most significant seven features exhibited an acceptable performance rate for the diagnosis of PAD with 100.0% sensitivity and 90.3% specificity.\nAn RF model was a more effective method than the logistic regression and ABI for the diagnosis of PAD in an elderly cohort.", "The primary purpose of this study was to compare the working memory performance of monolingual English-speaking second- grade children with dyslexia (N\u00a0=\u00a082) to second-grade children with typical development (N\u00a0=\u00a0167). Prior to making group comparisons, it is important to demonstrate invariance between working memory models in both groups or between-group comparisons would not be valid. Thus, we completed invariance testing using a model of working memory that had been validated for children with typical development (Gray et al., 2017) to see if it was valid for children with dyslexia. We tested three types of invariance: configural (does the model test the same constructs?), metric (are the factor loadings equivalent?), and scalar (are the item intercepts the same?). Group comparisons favoured the children with typical development across all three working memory factors. However, differences in the Focus-of-Attention/Visuospatial factor could be explained by group differences in non-verbal intelligence and language skills. In contrast, differences in the Phonological and Central Executive working memory factors remained, even after accounting for non-verbal intelligence and language. Results highlight the need for researchers and educators to attend not only to the phonological aspects of working memory in children with dyslexia, but also to central executive function.", "Psychological research shows that as the main component of enterprise decision-making, CEOs are not completely rational, cognitive and psychological biases often influence their decision-making process. CEO narcissism has gradually attracted academic attention. Based on upper echelon theory and subconscious theory, this paper uses advanced artificial intelligence technology to quantify CEO narcissism as a kind of emotional intelligence. Taking A-share listed companies in China from 2010 to 2019 as research objects, this paper empirically tests the impact of CEO narcissism on debt financing and innovation performance. The results show that CEO narcissism has a significant positive impact on firm innovation performance. Debt financing plays a mediating role in the relationship between CEO narcissism and firm innovation performance. CEO narcissism can have a positive impact on firm innovation performance through debt financing. Compared with non-SOEs, SOEs' CEO narcissism has a more significant positive effect on debt financing and enterprise innovation performance. The research in this paper enriches psychology and organizational management and provides a reference for an enterprise's management decisions and for investors' investment decisions.", "Capsule endoscopy (CE) is pivotal for evaluation of small bowel disease. Obscure gastrointestinal bleeding most often originates from the small bowel. CE frequently identifies a wide range of lesions with different bleeding potentials in these patients. However, reading CE examinations is a time-consuming task. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are highly efficient artificial intelligence tools for image analysis. This study aims to develop a CNN-based model for identification and differentiation of multiple small bowel lesions with distinct haemorrhagic potential using CE images.\nWe developed, trained, and validated a denary CNN based on CE images. Each frame was labelled according to the type of lesion (lymphangiectasia, xanthomas, ulcers, erosions, vascular lesions, protruding lesions, and blood). The haemorrhagic potential was assessed by Saurin's classification. The entire dataset was divided into training and validation sets. The performance of the CNN was measured by the area under the receiving operating characteristic curve, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV).\nA total of 53 555 CE images were included. The model had an overall accuracy of 99%, a sensitivity of 88%, a specificity of 99%, a PPV of 87%, and an NPV of 99% for detection of multiple small bowel abnormalities and respective classification of bleeding potential.\nWe developed and tested a CNN-based model for automatic detection of multiple types of small bowel lesions and classification of the respective bleeding potential. This system may improve the diagnostic yield of CE for these lesions and overall CE efficiency.", "Approximately one-third of spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage patients did not know the onset time and were excluded from studies about time-dependent treatments for hyperacute spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage.\nTo help clinicians explore the benefit of time-dependent treatments for unclear-onset patients, we presented artificial intelligence models to identify onset time using non-contrast computed tomography (NCCT) based on weakly supervised multitask learning (WS-MTL) structure.\nThe patients with reliable symptom onset time (strong label) or repeat CT (weak label) were included and split into training set and test set (internal and external). The WS-MTL structure utilized strong and weak labels simultaneously to improve performance. The models included three binary classification models for classifying whether NCCT acquired within 6, 8 or 12\u2009h for different treatments measured by area under curve, and a regression model for determining the exact onset time measured by mean absolute error. The generalizability of models was also explored in comprehensive analysis.\nA total of 4004 patients with 10,780 NCCT scans were included. The performance of WS-MTL classification model showed high accuracy, and that of regression model was satisfactory in \u22646\u2009h subgroup. In comprehensive analysis, the WS-MTL showed better performance for larger hematomas and thinner scans. And the performance improved effectively as training amounts increasing and could be improved steadily through retraining.\nThe WS-MTL models showed good performance and generalizability. Considering the large number of unclear-onset spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage patients, it may be worth to integrate the WS-MTL model into clinical practice to identify the onset time.", "Intra-cortical myelin is a myelinated part of the cerebral cortex that is responsible for the spread and synchronization of neuronal activity in the cortex. Recent animal studies have established a link between obesity and impaired oligodendrocyte maturation vis-\u00e0-vis cells that produce and maintain myelin; however, the association between obesity and intra-cortical myelination remains to be established. To investigate the effects of obesity on intra-cortical myelin in living humans, we employed a large, demographically well-characterized sample of healthy young adults drawn from the Human Connectome Project (n = 1066). Intra-cortical myelin was assessed using a novel T1-w/T2-w ratio method. Linear regression analysis was used to investigate the association between body mass index (BMI), an indicator of obesity, and intra-cortical myelination, adjusting for covariates of no interest. We observed BMI was related to lower intra-cortical myelination in regions previously identified to be involved in reward processing (i.e., medial orbitofrontal cortex, rostral anterior cingulate cortex), attention (i.e., visual cortex, inferior/middle temporal gyrus), and salience detection (i.e., insula, supramarginal gyrus) in response to viewing food cues (corrected p < 0.05). In addition, higher BMIs were associated with more intra-cortical myelination in regions associated with somatosensory processing (i.e., the somatosensory network) and inhibitory control (i.e., lateral inferior frontal gyrus, frontal pole). These findings were also replicated after controlling for key potential confounding factors including total intracranial volume, substance use, and fluid intelligence. Findings suggested that altered intra-cortical myelination may represent a novel microstructure-level substrate underlying prior abnormal obesity-related brain neural activity, and lays a foundation for future investigations designed to evaluate how living habits, such as dietary habit and physical activity, affect intra-cortical myelination.", "Background and Objectives: Autonomic nervous system (ANS) dysfunction is present in early stages of alcohol abuse and increases the likelihood of cardiovascular events. Given the nonlinear pattern of dynamic interaction between sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and para sympathetic nervous system (PNS) and the complex relationship with lifestyle factors, machine learning (ML) algorithms are best suited for analyzing alcohol impact over heart rate variability (HRV), because they allow the analysis of complex interactions between multiple variables. This study aimed to characterize autonomic nervous system dysfunction by analysis of HRV correlated with cardiovascular risk factors in young individuals by using machine learning. Materials and Methods: Total of 142 young adults (28.4 \u00b1 4.34 years) agreed to participate in the study. Alcohol intake and drinking patterns were assessed by the AUDIT (Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test) questionnaire and the YAI (Yearly Alcohol Intake) index. A short 5-min HRV evaluation was performed. Post-hoc analysis and machine learning algorithms were used to assess the impact of alcohol intake on HRV. Results: Binge drinkers presented slight modification in the frequency domain. Heavy drinkers had significantly lower time-domain values: standard deviation of RR intervals (SDNN) and root mean square of the successive differences (RMSSD), compared to casual and binge drinkers. High frequency (HF) values were significantly lower in heavy drinkers (p = 0.002). The higher low-to-high frequency ratio (LF/HF) that we found in heavy drinkers was interpreted as parasympathetic inhibition. Gradient boosting machine learner regression showed that age and alcohol consumption had the biggest scaled impact on the analyzed HRV parameters, followed by smoking, anxiety, depression, and body mass index. Gender and physical activity had the lowest impact on HRV. Conclusions: In healthy young adults, high alcohol intake has a negative impact on HRV in both time and frequency-domains. In parameters like HRV, where a multitude of risk factors can influence measurements, artificial intelligence algorithms seem to be a viable alternative for correct assessment.", "Lithium is an effective treatment for bipolar disorder, also during pregnancy to prevent the recurrence of episodes in the perinatal period. Little is known about the neuropsychological development of lithium-exposed offspring. The current study was designed to investigate neuropsychological functioning in lithium-exposed children with the aim to provide further knowledge on the long-term effects of lithium use during pregnancy.\nParticipants were offspring of women with a diagnosis of bipolar spectrum disorder, aged 6-14\u00a0years. In total, 99 children participated in the study, 56 were exposed to lithium in utero and 43 were not exposed to lithium. Neuropsychological tests were administered, including the Snijders-Oomen Nonverbal Intelligence Test and the NEPSY-II-NL assessment. Linear and negative binomial regression models were used to investigate the association between prenatal lithium exposure and neuropsychological functioning. In secondary analyses, the association between lithium blood level during pregnancy and neuropsychological functioning was assessed. Additionally, norm scores and percentiles for task outcomes were calculated.\nLithium use during pregnancy was associated with the total number of mistakes made on the Auditory Attention task, but not statistically significant after full adjustment for potential confounding factors. No association between prenatal lithium exposure and IQ was found. Also, no relationship between lithium blood level during pregnancy and neuropsychological functioning was found after adjustment for potential confounders. Task outcomes in both groups were comparable to the general population.\nIn this study, we found no evidence for significantly altered neuropsychological functioning of lithium-exposed children at the age of 6-14\u00a0years, when compared to non-lithium-exposed controls.", "Our current work contributes to the literature of meat consumption reduction. Capitalizing on the inherent humanizing characteristic of anthropomorphism coupled with leveraging negativity bias, we created a novel approach to reduce meat-eating intention. Using on-pack product stickers, we compare an anthropomorphic message stressing the capacity to experience pain with two other anthropomorphic messages that have been used before in the literature (intelligence and pro-social behavior of animals). We find that an on-pack pain anthropomorphic sticker reduces purchase intentions of the meat product and intention to consume meat in general and is more effective than stickers displaying pro-social or intelligence messages. We also show that the pain message's negative impact on purchase intention is serially mediated by anticipatory guilt and attitude towards meat. In addition, we show that the differential effectiveness of the anthropomorphic messages can be explained by the negativity bias. That is, when the pro-social and intelligence messages were formulated in a negative way (as is pain), all three messages were equally effective at reducing intention to purchase meat and increase intention to reduce meat consumption.", "Epigenetic research holds great promise to advance our understanding of biomarkers and regulatory processes in health and disease. An increasing number of new approaches, ranging from molecular to biophysical analyses, enable identifying epigenetic changes on the level of a single gene or the whole epigenome. The aim of this review is to highlight how the field is shifting from completely molecular-biology-driven solutions to multidisciplinary strategies including more reliance on biophysical analysis tools. Biophysics not only offers technical advancements in imaging or structure analysis but also helps to explore regulatory interactions. New computational methods are also being developed to meet the demand of growing data volumes and their processing. Therefore, it is important to capture these new directions in epigenetics from a biophysical perspective and discuss current challenges as well as multiple applications of biophysical methods and tools. Specifically, we gradually introduce different biophysical research methods by first considering the DNA-level information and eventually higher-order chromatin structures. Moreover, we aim to highlight that the incorporation of bioinformatics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence into biophysical analysis allows gaining new insights into complex epigenetic processes. The gained understanding has already proven useful in translational and clinical research providing better patient stratification options or\u00a0new therapeutic insights. Together, this offers a better readiness to transform bench-top experiments into industrial high-throughput applications with a possibility to employ developed methods in clinical practice and diagnostics.", "The COVID-pandemic has shown significant impact on cancer care from early detection, management plan to clinical outcomes of cancer patients. The Asian National Cancer Centres Alliance (ANCCA) has put together the 9 \"Ps\" as guidelines for cancer programs to better prepare for the next pandemic. The 9 \"Ps\" are Priority, Protocols and Processes, Patients, People, Personal Protective Equipments (PPEs), Pharmaceuticals, Places, Preparedness, and Politics.

Politics: to ensure leadership which bring trust, cohesion and solidarity for successful response to pandemic and mitigate negative impact on the healthcare system.", "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is one of the hottest topics in our society, especially when it comes to solving data-analysis problems. Industry are conducting their digital shifts, and AI is becoming a cornerstone technology for making decisions out of the huge amount of (sensors-based) data available in the production floor. However, such technology may be disappointing when deployed in real conditions. Despite good theoretical performances and high accuracy when trained and tested in isolation, a Machine-Learning (M-L) model may provide degraded performances in real conditions. One reason may be fragility in treating properly unexpected or perturbed data. The objective of the paper is therefore to study the robustness of seven M-L and Deep-Learning (D-L) algorithms, when classifying univariate time-series under perturbations. A systematic approach is proposed for artificially injecting perturbations in the data and for evaluating the robustness of the models. This approach focuses on two perturbations that are likely to happen during data collection. Our experimental study, conducted on twenty sensors' datasets from the public University of California Riverside (UCR) repository, shows a great disparity of the models' robustness under data quality degradation. Those results are used to analyse whether the impact of such robustness can be predictable-thanks to decision trees-which would prevent us from testing all perturbations scenarios. Our study shows that building such a predictor is not straightforward and suggests that such a systematic approach needs to be used for evaluating AI models' robustness.", "The novel of coronavirus (COVID-19) has suddenly and abruptly changed the world as we knew at the start of the 3rd decade of the 21st century. Particularly, COVID-19 pandemic has negatively affected financial econometrics and stock markets across the globe. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML)-based prediction models, especially Deep Neural Network (DNN) architectures, have the potential to act as a key enabling factor to reduce the adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and future possible ones on financial markets. In this regard, first, a unique COVID-19 related PRIce MOvement prediction ( COVID19\u00a0PRIMO ) dataset is introduced in this paper, which incorporates effects of social media trends related to COVID-19 on stock market price movements. Afterwards, a novel hybrid and parallel DNN-based framework is proposed that integrates different and diversified learning architectures. Referred to as the COVID-19 adopted Hybrid and Parallel deep fusion framework for Stock price Movement Prediction ( COVID19-HPSMP ), innovative fusion strategies are used to combine scattered social media news related to COVID-19 with historical mark data. The proposed COVID19-HPSMP consists of two parallel paths (hence hybrid), one based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with Local/Global Attention modules, and one integrated CNN and Bi-directional Long Short term Memory (BLSTM) path. The two parallel paths are followed by a multilayer fusion layer acting as a fusion center that combines localized features. Performance evaluations are performed based on the introduced COVID19\u00a0PRIMO dataset illustrating superior performance of the proposed framework.", "Radiomics is the conversion of medical images into quantitative high-dimensional data. Laryngeal cancer, one of the most common head and neck cancers, has risen globally by 58.7%. CT, MRI and PET are acquired during the diagnostic process providing potential data for radiomic analysis and correlation with outcomes.This review aims to examine the applications of this technique to laryngeal cancer and the future considerations for translation into clinical practice.\nA comprehensive systematic review-informed search of the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases was undertaken. Keywords \"laryngeal cancer\" OR \"larynx\" OR \"larynx cancer\" OR \"head and neck cancer\" were combined with \"radiomic\" OR \"signature\" OR \"machine learning\" OR \"artificial intelligence\". Additional articles were obtained from bibliographies using the \"snowball method\".\nThe included studies (n = 15) demonstrated that radiomic features are significantly associated with various clinical outcomes (including stage, overall survival, treatment response, progression-free survival) and that predictive models incorporating radiomic features are superior to those that do not. Two studies demonstrated radiomics could improve laryngeal cancer staging whilst 12 studies affirmed its predictive capability for clinical outcomes.\nRadiomics has potential for improving multiple aspects of laryngeal cancer care; however, the heterogeneous cohorts and lack of data on laryngeal cancer exclusively inhibits firm conclusions. Large prospective well-designed studies in laryngeal cancer are required to progress this field. Furthermore, to implement radiomics into clinical practice, a unified research effort is required to standardise radiomics practice.\nThis review has highlighted the value of radiomics in enhancing laryngeal cancer care (including staging, prognosis and predicting treatment response).", "Photodocumentation during endoscopy procedures is one of the indicators for endoscopy performance quality; however, this indicator is difficult to measure and audit in the endoscopy unit. Emerging artificial intelligence technology may solve this problem, which requires a large amount of material for model development. We developed a deep learning-based endoscopic anatomy classification system through convolutional neural networks with an accelerated data preparation approach.\nWe retrospectively collected 8,041 images from esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) procedures and labeled them using two experts for nine anatomical locations of the upper gastrointestinal tract. A base model for EGD image multiclass classification was first developed, and an additional 6,091 images were enrolled and classified by the base model. A total of 5,963 images were manually confirmed and added to develop the subsequent enhanced model. Additional internal and external endoscopy image datasets were used to test the model performance.\nThe base model achieved total accuracy of 96.29%. For the enhanced model, the total accuracy was 96.64%. The overall accuracy improved with the enhanced model compared with the base model for the internal test dataset without narrowband images (93.05% vs. 91.25%, p\u2009<\u20090.01) or with narrowband images (92.74% vs. 90.46%, p\u2009<\u20090.01). The total accuracy was 92.56% of the enhanced model on the external test dataset.\nWe constructed a deep learning-based model with an accelerated approach that can be used for quality control in endoscopy units. The model was also validated with both internal and external datasets with high accuracy.", "Combined ultrasound and photoacoustic (USPA) imaging has attracted several pre-clinical and clinical applications due to its ability to simultaneously display structural, functional, and molecular information of deep biological tissue in real time. However, the depth and wavelength dependent optical attenuation and the unknown optical and acoustic heterogeneities limit the USPA imaging performance in deep tissue regions. Novel instrumentation, image reconstruction, and artificial intelligence (AI) methods are currently being investigated to overcome these limitations and improve the USPA image quality. Effective implementation of these approaches requires a reliable USPA simulation tool capable of generating US based anatomical and PA based molecular contrasts of deep biological tissue. Here, we developed a hybrid USPA simulation platform by integrating finite element models of light (NIRFast) and ultrasound (k-Wave) propagations for co-simulation of B-mode US and PA images. The platform allows optimization of different design parameters for USPA devices, such as the aperture size and frequency of both light and ultrasound detector arrays. For designing tissue-realistic digital phantoms, a dictionary-based function has been added to k-Wave to generate various levels of ultrasound speckle contrast. The feasibility of modeling US imaging combined with optical fluence dependent multispectral PA imaging is demonstrated using homogeneous as well as heterogeneous tissue phantoms mimicking human organs (e.g., prostate and finger). In addition, we also demonstrate the potential of the simulation platform to generate large scale application-specific training and test datasets for AI enhanced USPA imaging. The complete USPA simulation codes together with the supplementary user guides have been posted to an open-source repository (https://github.com/KothapalliLabPSU/US-PA_simulation_codes).", "In this study, we chose 17 worldwide sheep populations of eight breeds, which were intensively selected for different purposes (meat, milk, or wool), or locally-adapted breeds, in order to identify and characterize factors impacting the detection of runs of homozygosity (ROH) and heterozygosity-rich regions (HRRs) in sheep. We also applied a business intelligence (BI) tool to integrate and visualize outputs from complementary analyses. We observed a prevalence of short ROH, and a clear distinction between the ROH profiles across populations. The visualizations showed a fragmentation of medium and long ROH segments. Furthermore, we tested different scenarios for the detection of HRR and evaluated the impact of the detection parameters used. Our findings suggest that HRRs are small and frequent in the sheep genome; however, further studies with higher density SNP chips and different detection methods are suggested for future research. We also defined ROH and HRR islands and identified common regions across the populations, where genes related to a variety of traits were reported, such as body size, muscle development, and brain functions. These results indicate that such regions are associated with many traits, and thus were under selective pressure in sheep breeds raised for different purposes. Interestingly, many candidate genes detected within the HRR islands were associated with brain integrity. We also observed a strong association of high linkage disequilibrium pattern with ROH compared with HRR, despite the fact that many regions in linkage disequilibrium were not located in ROH regions.", "(1) Background: University transition is a critical step in career construction due to the uncertainty and unpredictability of socioeconomic conditions; these conditions compel people to manage a greater quantity of perceived risks associated with their career projects than in the past, and to face unexpected situations that could compromise their quality of life in educational and work contexts. After all, experiencing well-being during the university path can undoubtedly affect the visions of one's future work, especially when a transition period is nearby. The present study aimed to explore the role of subjective risk intelligence in expectations about future work, analyzing the potential mediational role of academic satisfaction in this relationship. (2) Methods: A longitudinal study was carried out on 352 Italian university students at the end of the degree course. We used the following measures: in T1, Subjective risk intelligence scale, College Satisfaction scale; in T2, three items assessing the expectations about future work. (3) Results: The main findings showed that subjective risk intelligence has both direct and indirect effects (through the mediation of college satisfaction) on the expectations about future work. (4) Conclusions: The ability to manage risks, also through the contribution of domain-specific satisfaction, can lead to positive expectations toward one's future work. This could increase the likelihood to perform career-related behaviors in a more proactive way if people have high risk management skills and high levels of academic satisfaction with their university path during transition.", "Interest in artificial intelligence-driven analysis of medical images has seen a steep increase in recent years. Thus, our paper aims to promote and facilitate the use of this state-of-the-art technology to fellow researchers and clinicians.\nWe present custom deep learning models generated in DeePathology\u2122 STUDIO without the need for background knowledge in deep learning and computer science underlined by practical suggestions.\nWe describe the general workflow in this commercially available software and present three real-world examples how to detect microglia on IBA1-stained mouse brain sections including their differences, validation results and analysis of a sample slide.\nDeep-learning assisted analysis of histological images is faster than classical analysis methods, and offers a wide variety of detection possibilities that are not available using methods based on staining intensity.\nReduced researcher bias, increased speed and extended possibilities make deep-learning assisted analysis of histological images superior to traditional analysis methods for histological images.", "Problematic smartphone use (PSU) is a public health issue that is currently rising among adolescents. The Compensatory Internet Use Theory (CIUT) poses that difficulties in handling negative life circumstances could result in PSU. Furthermore, the Interaction of Person-Affect-Cognition-Execution (I-PACE) model suggests that the interaction between core characteristics and affective and cognitive responses could lead to PSU. The present study aimed to clarify the links between psychological distress and PSU by exploring rumination as a mediator and emotional intelligence (EI) as a moderator.\nA sample of 1882 adolescents (54% female, 46% male) completed measures of psychological distress, rumination, EI and PSU. The PROCESS macro was used to conduct a moderated mediation analysis.\nThe mediation results showed a significant indirect effect from psychological distress to PSU through rumination. Furthermore, EI was a significant moderator of this effect. Thus, in adolescents with higher EI, the effect of psychological distress on PSU through rumination was not significant.\nCross-sectional data do not imply causality and further studies should use longitudinal designs. Self-report questionnaires may be susceptible to social desirability bias and future studies including other sources of information may help to minimize such bias.\nThis study contributes to the field of problematic digital technology usage, showing that the link between psychological distress and PSU depends on the EI levels, which might influence PSU indirectly through rumination. Furthermore, empirical evidence for the CIUT and I-PACE models was provided. Lastly, interventions aiming at training EI may aid in the prevention of PSU.", "Smartphone overdependence (SO) in mothers of preschoolers (MPs) reduces the parenting capacity of MPs. The current study aimed to identify associated factors of SO in MPs through a systematic review and meta-analysis conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines using 10 electronic databases. A total of 18 studies met the inclusion criteria. It was confirmed that SO in MPs is a coping strategy used to manage stress during childrearing. Parenting stress, depression, unemployment, and low household income were identified as risk factors that increased SO in MPs. Protective factors that reduced SO in MPs included resilience and parental intelligence. Findings emphasize the need to assess risk factors to prevent SO in MPs. It is suggested that programs to prevent SO in MPs be developed based on results of this study.

To assess long-term outcomes at an early school age in children who had experienced perinatal hypoxia or asphyxia, where therapeutic hypothermia was not applied. Materials and Methods: The case group children were 8-9-year-old children (n = 32) who were born at full term and experienced hypoxia or asphyxia at birth, where therapeutic hypothermia (TH) was not applied. The control group consisted of 8-9-year-old children (n = 16) born without hypoxia. A structured neurological examination was performed at an early school age. The neuromotor function was assessed using the Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS). Health-related quality-of-life was assessed using the Health Utilities Index (HUI) questionnaire. Intellectual abilities were assessed using the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC). Results: The case group, compared with controls, had significantly (p = 0.002) lower mean [SD] full-scale IQ (87(16.86) vs. 107(12.15)), verbal-scale IQ (89(17.45) vs. 105(11.55)), verbal comprehension index (89(17.36) vs. 105(10.74)), working memory index (89(15.68) vs. 104(11.84)), performance IQ (87(16.51) vs. 108(15.48)) and perceptual organization index (85(15.71) vs. 105(15.93)). We did not find any significant differences in the incidence of disorders of neurological examination, movement abilities and health-related quality of life at an early school age between the case and the control group children. Conclusion: In children who experienced perinatal asphyxia but did not have cerebral paralysis (CP), where therapeutic hypothermia was not applied, cognitive assessment scores at an early school age were significantly lower compared to those in the group of healthy children, and were at a low average level.", "Teletesting has the potential to reduce numerous barriers to patient care which have only become exacerbated during the COVID-19 pandemic. Although telehealth is commonly utilized throughout medicine and mental health practices, teletesting has remained limited within cognitive and academic evaluations. This may be largely due to concern for the validity of test administration via remote assessment. This cross-sectional study examined the equivalency of cognitive [Wechsler Intelligence Scales for Children - Fifth Edition (WISC-V)] and academic [Kaufman Test of Educational Achievement - Third Edition (KTEA-3)] subtests administered via either teletesting or traditional in-person testing within clinically referred youth.\nChart review using a retrospective, cross-sectional design included a total of 893 children and adolescents, ranging from 4 to 17 years (Mean age = 10.2 years, SD = 2.9 years) who were administered at least one subtest from the aforementioned cognitive or academic assessments. Of these, 285 received teletesting, with the remaining (n = 608) receiving in-person assessment. A total of seven subtests (five from the WISC-V and two from the KTEA-3) were examined. A series of inverse probability of exposure weighted (IPEW) linear regression models examined differences between groups for each of the seven subtests after adjustment for numerous demographic, diagnostic, and parent-reported symptom variables.\nOnly two significant differences were found, such that WISC-V Visual Puzzles (p < .01) and KTEA-3 Math Concepts (p = .03) scores were slightly higher in the teletesting versus in-person groups. However, these differences were quite small in magnitude (WISC-V Visual Puzzles, d = .33, KTEA-3 Math Concepts, d = .18).\nFindings indicate equivalency across methods of service delivery without clinically meaningful differences in scores among referred pediatric patients.", "Edge intelligence (EI) has received a lot of interest because it can reduce latency, increase efficiency, and preserve privacy. More significantly, as the Internet of Things (IoT) has proliferated, billions of portable and embedded devices have been interconnected, producing zillions of gigabytes on edge networks. Thus, there is an immediate need to push AI (artificial intelligence) breakthroughs within edge networks to achieve the full promise of edge data analytics. EI solutions have supported digital technology workloads and applications from the infrastructure level to edge networks; however, there are still many challenges with the heterogeneity of computational capabilities and the spread of information sources. We propose a novel event-driven deep-learning framework, called EDL-EI (event-driven deep learning for edge intelligence), via the design of a novel event model by defining events using correlation analysis with multiple sensors in real-world settings and incorporating multi-sensor fusion techniques, a transformation method for sensor streams into images, and lightweight 2-dimensional convolutional neural network (CNN) models. To demonstrate the feasibility of the EDL-EI framework, we presented an IoT-based prototype system that we developed with multiple sensors and edge devices. To verify the proposed framework, we have a case study of air-quality scenarios based on the benchmark data provided by the USA Environmental Protection Agency for the most polluted cities in South Korea and China. We have obtained outstanding predictive accuracy (97.65% and 97.19%) from two deep-learning models on the cities' air-quality patterns. Furthermore, the air-quality changes from 2019 to 2020 have been analyzed to check the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown.", "The concern in the scientific community for the study of people with dementia and their families is comprehensible, especially the importance of knowing the effects that caring for the patient has on their family dynamic, paying special attention to the main caregiver. The objective of this study was to analyze the relationship of resilience and emotional intelligence with functional performance in the main caregivers of people with dementia in Spain according to the phase of the disease.\nA cross-sectional, descriptive, and analytical study was carried out. A total of 144 primary family caregivers of patients with dementia in Spain were included in the study. The following variables were measured: sociodemographic, psychosocial, and occupational, as well as resilience and emotional intelligence.\nThe caregivers obtained a low moderate resilience (mean = 64.01 \u00b1 14.5), an emotional intelligence bordering between moderate and high (mean = 78.48 \u00b1 14.82), and a 61.8% self-care categorized as somewhat and quite a bit. The presence of higher levels of resilience in family caregivers of people with dementia were positively related to the time spent on self-care (r = 0.227; p = 0.033) and leisure (r = 0.262; p = 0.014), especially in the moderate phase of the disease, while in the severe phase, this relationship appeared with productivity (r = 0.355; p = 0.034). The higher levels of emotional intelligence were positively related to a greater time dedicated to self-care (r = 0.233, p = 0.005), as well as the data observed in the moderate and severe phase (r = 0.214; p = 0.046 and r = 0.398; p = 0.016 respectively).\nThe primary caregivers of relatives with dementia who have higher levels of resilience and emotional intelligence spend more time on self-care and leisure activities, especially in the moderate phase of the disease.", "Liquid biopsy is the process of sampling and analyzing body fluids, which enables non-invasive monitoring of complex biological systems in vivo. Liquid biopsy has myriad applications in health and disease as a wide variety of components, ranging from circulating cells to cell-free nucleic acid molecules, can be analyzed. Here, we review different components of liquid biopsy, survey state-of-the-art, non-invasive methods for detecting those components, demonstrate their clinical applications and discuss ethical considerations. Furthermore, we emphasize the importance of artificial intelligence in analyzing liquid biopsy data with the aim of developing ethically-responsible non-invasive technologies that can enhance individualized healthcare. While previous reviews have mainly focused on cancer, this review primarily highlights applications of liquid biopsy in reproductive medicine.", "The present study assessed the developmental dynamics of trait emotional intelligence (TEI) and its subdomains during English as a foreign language (EFL) learning in a longitudinal study. A sample of 309 EFL learners (217 females, 92 males) was used to assess the trajectories of the global factor of TEI and the parallel development of the TEI subdomains over 1 year in the context of the EFL classroom using parallel process modeling (PPM) and factor of curve modeling (FCM). Additionally, emotion perception (EP) was used as a distal outcome to investigate how growth parameters, including intercept and slope factors in a TEI-FCM, influence the distal outcome of EP. The results revealed that there was sufficient inter-individual variation and intra-individual trends within each subdomain and a significant increase over time across the four subdomains. Additionally, concerning the covariances within and among the subdomains of TEI, the PPM results revealed moderate to high associations between the intercept and slope growth factors within and between these subdomains. Finally, regarding the direct association of the global growth factors (intercept and slope) of TEI on EP, the results indicated that the intercept and slope of global TEI were associated with EP (\u03b30 = 1.127, p < 0.001; \u03b31 = 0.321, p < 0.001). Specifically, the intercepts and slopes of emotionality and sociability turned out to be significantly linked to EP (\u03b303 = 1.311, p < 0.001; \u03b313 = 0.684, p < 0.001; \u03b304 = 0.497, p < 0.001; \u03b314 = 0.127, p < 0.001). These results suggest the dynamicity of TEI during learning a foreign language are discussed in this study in light of the potential variables associated with TEI and its related literature.", "A self-powered system based on energy harvesting technology can be a potential candidate for solving the problem of supplying power to electronic devices. In this review, we focus on portable and wearable self-powered systems, starting with typical energy harvesting technology, and introduce portable and wearable self-powered systems with sensing functions. In addition, we demonstrate the potential of self-powered systems in actuation functions and the development of self-powered systems toward intelligent functions under the support of information processing and artificial intelligence technologies.", "Deep learning is a subdiscipline of artificial intelligence that uses a machine learning technique called artificial neural networks to extract patterns and make predictions from large data sets. The increasing adoption of deep learning across healthcare domains together with the availability of highly characterised cancer datasets has accelerated research into the utility of deep learning in the analysis of the complex biology of cancer. While early results are promising, this is a rapidly evolving field with new knowledge emerging in both cancer biology and deep learning. In this review, we provide an overview of emerging deep learning techniques and how they are being applied to oncology. We focus on the deep learning applications for omics data types, including genomic, methylation and transcriptomic data, as well as histopathology-based genomic inference, and provide perspectives on how the different data types can be integrated to develop decision support tools. We provide specific examples of how deep learning may be applied in cancer diagnosis, prognosis and treatment management. We also assess the current limitations and challenges for the application of deep learning in precision oncology, including the lack of phenotypically rich data and the need for more explainable deep learning models. Finally, we conclude with a discussion of how current obstacles can be overcome to enable future clinical utilisation of deep learning.", "Accurate predictions of COVID-19 epidemic dynamics may enable timely organizational interventions in high-risk regions. We exploited the interconnection of the Fresenius Medical Care (FMC) European dialysis clinic network to develop a sentinel surveillance system for outbreak prediction. We developed an artificial intelligence-based model considering the information related to all clinics belonging to the European Nephrocare Network. The prediction tool provides risk scores of the occurrence of a COVID-19 outbreak in each dialysis center within a 2-week forecasting horizon. The model input variables include information related to the epidemic status and trends in clinical practice patterns of the target clinic, regional epidemic metrics, and the distance-weighted risk estimates of adjacent dialysis units. On the validation dates, there were 30 (5.09%), 39 (6.52%), and 218 (36.03%) clinics with two or more patients with COVID-19 infection during the 2-week prediction window. The performance of the model was suitable in all testing windows: AUC = 0.77, 0.80, and 0.81, respectively. The occurrence of new cases in a clinic propagates distance-weighted risk estimates to proximal dialysis units. Our machine learning sentinel surveillance system may allow for a prompt risk assessment and timely response to COVID-19 surges throughout networked European clinics.", "Human intelligence is usually measured by well-established psychometric tests through a series of problem solving. The recorded cognitive scores are continuous but usually heavy-tailed with potential outliers and violating the normality assumption. Meanwhile, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides an unparalleled opportunity to study brain structures and cognitive ability. Motivated by association studies between MRI images and human intelligence, we propose a tensor quantile regression model, which is a general and robust alternative to the commonly used scalar-on-image linear regression. Moreover, we take into account rich spatial information of brain structures, incorporating low-rankness and piece-wise smoothness of imaging coefficients into a regularized regression framework. We formulate the optimization problem as a sequence of penalized quantile regressions with a generalized Lasso penalty based on tensor decomposition, and develop a computationally efficient alternating direction method of multipliers algorithm (ADMM) to estimate the model components. Extensive numerical studies are conducted to examine the empirical performance of the proposed method and its competitors. Finally, we apply the proposed method to a large-scale important dataset: the Human Connectome Project. We find that the tensor quantile regression can serve as a prognostic tool to assess future risk of cognitive impairment progression. More importantly, with the proposed method, we are able to identify the most activated brain subregions associated with quantiles of human intelligence. The prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortex are found to be mostly associated with lower and upper quantile of fluid intelligence. The insular cortex associated with median of fluid intelligence is a rarely reported region.", "Incidence rate of mental illness is increasing year by year with the development of city. The amount of modern medical data is huge and complex. In many cases, it is difficult to realize the rational allocation of resources, which puts forward an urgent demand for the artificial intelligence of modern medicine and brings great pressure to the development of the medical industry. The purpose of this study is to develop and construct a grey correlation analysis and related drug evaluation system of mental diseases based on deep convolution neural network. The establishment of the system can effectively improve the automation and intelligence of modern psychiatric treatment process. In this article, the grey correlation analysis of patient data is carried out, and then, the optimized deep convolution neural network is constructed. Combined with the medical knowledge base, the analysis of disease results is realized, and on this basis, the efficacy of related drugs in the treatment of mental diseases is evaluated. The results show that the advantage of the deep convolution neural network system is to effectively improve the induction rate. What's more, compared with other algorithms, this algorithm has higher accuracy and efficiency. It improves the comprehensiveness and informatization of disease screening methods, improves the accuracy of screening, reduces the consumption of doctors' human resources, and provides a theoretical basis for the digitization of the medical industry in the future.", "Machine learning (ML) is a collection of algorithms allowing computers to learn directly from data without predetermined equations. It is used widely to analyze \"big data\". In gastrointestinal surgery, surgeons deal with various data such as clinical parameters, surgical videos, and pathological images, to stratify surgical risk, perform safe surgery and predict patient prognosis. In the current \"big data\" era, the accelerating accumulation of a large amount of data drives studies using ML algorithms. Three subfields of ML are supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. In this review, we summarize applications of ML to surgical practice in the preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative phases of care. Prediction and stratification using ML is promising; however, the current overarching concern is the availability of ML models. Information systems that can manage \"big data\" and integrate ML models into electronic health records are essential to incorporate ML into daily practice. ML is fundamental technology to meaningfully process data that exceeds the capacity of the human mind to comprehend. The accelerating accumulation of a large amount of data is changing the nature of surgical practice fundamentally. Artificial intelligence (AI), represented by ML, is being incorporated into daily surgical practice.", "Ab initio Quantum-Mechanical methods are well-established tools for material characterization and discovery in many technological areas. Recently, state-of-the-art approaches based on density-functional theory and many-body perturbation theory were successfully applied to semiconducting alkali antimonides and tellurides, which are currently employed as photocathodes in particle accelerator facilities. The results of these studies have unveiled the potential of ab initio methods to complement experimental and technical efforts for the development of new, more efficient materials for vacuum electron sources. Concomitantly, these findings have revealed the need for theory to go beyond the status quo in order to face the challenges of modeling such complex systems and their properties in operando conditions. In this review, we summarize recent progress in the application of ab initio many-body methods to investigate photocathode materials, analyzing the merits and the limitations of the standard approaches with respect to the confronted scientific questions. In particular, we emphasize the necessary trade-off between computational accuracy and feasibility that is intrinsic to these studies, and propose possible routes to optimize it. We finally discuss novel schemes for computationally-aided material discovery that are suitable for the development of ultra-bright electron sources toward the incoming era of artificial intelligence.", "Taiwan was successful in containing the spread of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) in 2020. One major factor in this success was the compilation and provision of comprehensive information about the pandemic. The present study proposes a pandemic intelligence system that provides data on the number of epidemic prevention professionals in each county and city, as well as daily confirmed cases, the demographics of the confirmed cases, and available resources (negative-pressure room beds and artificial ventilation apparatuses) in hospitals. Furthermore, the system provides the location of pharmacies selling masks and their current inventories, as well as the distribution of crowds at popular tourist destinations and social-distance monitoring. The most frequently used map layer in the thematic map of the pandemic is that of crowd distribution during the study period from March 2020 until the end of the same year. The case study used in this investigation for applying the system is represented by the 4-day weekend for Tomb-Sweeping Day of 2020. Through the real-time analysis of dynamic data and the integration of intelligence, the system offers a clear insight into changes in relevant information and, thus, enables the preemptive deployment of control measures by the county/city governments regarding pandemic management.", "The aim of the present study was to investigate the diagnostic performance of a trained convolutional neural network (CNN) for detecting and categorizing fissure sealants from intraoral photographs using the expert standard as reference. An image set consisting of 2352 digital photographs from permanent posterior teeth (461 unsealed tooth surfaces/1891 sealed surfaces) was divided into a training set (n = 1881/364/1517) and a test set (n = 471/97/374). All the images were scored according to the following categories: unsealed molar, intact, sufficient and insufficient sealant. Expert diagnoses served as the reference standard for cyclic training and repeated evaluation of the CNN (ResNeXt-101-32x8d), which was trained by using image augmentation and transfer learning. A statistical analysis was performed, including the calculation of contingency tables and areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The results showed that the CNN accurately detected sealants in 98.7% of all the test images, corresponding to an AUC of 0.996. The diagnostic accuracy and AUC were 89.6% and 0.951, respectively, for intact sealant; 83.2% and 0.888, respectively, for sufficient sealant; 92.4 and 0.942, respectively, for insufficient sealant. On the basis of the documented results, it was concluded that good agreement with the reference standard could be achieved for automatized sealant detection by using artificial intelligence methods. Nevertheless, further research is necessary to improve the model performance.", "The Wasserstein distance, especially among symmetric positive-definite matrices, has broad and deep influences on the development of artificial intelligence (AI) and other branches of computer science. In this paper, by involving the Wasserstein metric on SPD(n), we obtain computationally feasible expressions for some geometric quantities, including geodesics, exponential maps, the Riemannian connection, Jacobi fields and curvatures, particularly the scalar curvature. Furthermore, we discuss the behavior of geodesics and prove that the manifold is globally geodesic convex. Finally, we design algorithms for point cloud denoising and edge detecting of a polluted image based on the Wasserstein curvature on SPD(n). The experimental results show the efficiency and robustness of our curvature-based methods.", "Supervised machine learning models in artificial intelligence (AI) have been increasingly used to predict different types of events. However, their use in orthopaedic surgery has been limited.\nIt was hypothesized that supervised learning techniques could be used to build a mathematical model to predict primary anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries using a set of morphological features of the knee.\nCross-sectional study; Level of evidence, 3.\nIncluded were 50 adults who had undergone primary ACL reconstruction between 2008 and 2015. All patients were between 18 and 40 years of age at the time of surgery. Patients with a previous ACL injury, multiligament knee injury, previous ACL reconstruction, history of ACL revision surgery, complete meniscectomy, infection, missing data, and associated fracture were excluded. We also identified 50 sex-matched controls who had not sustained an ACL injury. For all participants, we used the preoperative magnetic resonance images to measure the anteroposterior lengths of the medial and lateral tibial plateaus as well as the lateral and medial bone slope (LBS and MBS), lateral and medial meniscal height (LMH and MMH), and lateral and medial meniscal slope (LMS and MMS). The AI predictor was created using Matlab R2019b. A Gaussian na\u00efve Bayes model was selected to create the predictor.\nPatients in the ACL injury group had a significantly increased posterior LBS (7.0\u00b0 \u00b1 4.7\u00b0 vs 3.9\u00b0 \u00b1 5.4\u00b0; P = .008) and LMS (-1.7\u00b0 \u00b1 4.8\u00b0 vs\u00a0-4.0\u00b0 \u00b1 4.2\u00b0; P = .002) and a lower MMH (5.5 \u00b1 0.1 vs 6.1 \u00b1 0.1 mm; P = .006) and LMH (6.9 \u00b1 0.1 vs 7.6 \u00b1 0.1 mm; P = .001). The AI model selected LBS and MBS as the best possible predictive combination, achieving 70% validation accuracy and 92% testing accuracy.\nA prediction model for primary ACL injury, created using machine learning techniques, achieved a >90% testing accuracy. Compared with patients who did not sustain an ACL injury, patients with torn ACLs had an increased posterior LBS and LMS and a lower MMH and LMH.", "In previous studies, a below-average, average, or above-average intelligence quotient (IQ) in children with SMA was detected but, aside from a severe physical disability, the cognitive performance of adult SMA patients has not yet been evaluated. The intelligence test used in this study, the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, fourth edition (WAIS-IV), was used to measure major intelligence components of adult SMA patients. The WAIS-IV determines four index scores representing verbal comprehension, perceptual reasoning, working memory, and processing speed. Due to time-dependent demands on motor function, the processing speed index score was excluded. IQ index scores of 33 adult SMA patients did not differ from IQ index scores of the normal population. In SMA type-3 patients, the index scores for verbal comprehension, perceptual reasoning, and working memory did not differ from the normal population but showed a trend of IQ scores towards lower points. Patients with SMA type 2 had lower IQ index scores for working memory (90.33 \u00b1 12.95; p = 0.012) and perceptual reasoning (90.73 \u00b1 12.58; p = 0.013) than the normal population. This study provided further evidence that SMA is a multi-systemic disease and may refute the widespread hypothesis that SMA patients might improve their cognitive skills to compensate for their physical impairment.", "Research of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has identified numerous molecular players involved in the disease development. Even so, the understanding of IBD is incomplete, while disease treatment is still far from the precision medicine. Reliable diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers in IBD are limited which may reduce efficient therapeutic outcomes. High-throughput technologies and artificial intelligence emerged as powerful tools in search of unrevealed molecular patterns that could give important insights into IBD pathogenesis and help to address unmet clinical needs. Machine learning, a subtype of artificial intelligence, uses complex mathematical algorithms to learn from existing data in order to predict future outcomes. The scientific community has been increasingly employing machine learning for the prediction of IBD outcomes from comprehensive patient data-clinical records, genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, metagenomic, and other IBD relevant omics data. This review aims to present fundamental principles behind machine learning modeling and its current application in IBD research with the focus on studies that explored genomic and transcriptomic data. We described different strategies used for dealing with omics data and outlined the best-performing methods. Before being translated into clinical settings, the developed machine learning models should be tested in independent prospective studies as well as randomized controlled trials.", "This study aimed to develop a novel detection model for automatically assessing the real contact relationship between mandibular third molars (MM3s) and the inferior alveolar nerve (IAN) based on panoramic radiographs processed with deep learning networks, minimizing pseudo-contact interference and reducing the frequency of cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) use. A deep-learning network approach based on YOLOv4, named as MM3-IANnet, was applied to oral panoramic radiographs for the first time. The relationship between MM3s and the IAN in CBCT was considered the real contact relationship. Accuracy metrics were calculated to evaluate and compare the performance of the MM3-IANnet, dentists and a cooperative approach with dentists and the MM3-IANnet. Our results showed that in comparison with detection by dentists (AP = 76.45%) or the MM3-IANnet (AP = 83.02%), the cooperative dentist-MM3-IANnet approach yielded the highest average precision (AP = 88.06%). In conclusion, the MM3-IANnet detection model is an encouraging artificial intelligence approach that might assist dentists in detecting the real contact relationship between MM3s and IANs based on panoramic radiographs.", "The adenoma detection rate is the constant subject of research and the main marker of quality in bowel cancer screening. However, by improving the quality of endoscopy via artificial intelligence methods, all polyps, including those with the potential for malignancy, can be removed, thereby reducing interval colorectal cancer rates. As such, the removal of all polyps may become the best marker of endoscopy quality. Thus, we present a viewpoint on integrating the computer-aided detection (CADe) of polyps with high-accuracy, real-time colonoscopy to challenge quality improvements in the performance of colonoscopy. Colonoscopy for bowel cancer screening involving the integration of a deep learning methodology (ie, integrating artificial intelligence with CADe systems) has been assessed in an effort to increase the adenoma detection rate. In this viewpoint, a few studies are described, and their results show that CADe systems are able to increase screening sensitivity. The detection of adenomatous polyps, which are associated with a potential risk of progression to colorectal cancer, and their removal are expected to reduce cancer incidence and mortality rates. However, so far, artificial intelligence methods do not increase the detection of cancer or large adenomatous polyps but contribute to the detection of small precancerous polyps.", "Conventional methods such as microscopy have been used to diagnose parasitic diseases and medical conditions related to arthropods for many years. Some techniques are considered gold standard methods. However, their limited sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy, and the need for costly reagents and high-skilled technicians are critical problems. New tools are therefore continually being developed to reduce pitfalls. Recently, three state-of-the-art techniques have emerged: DNA barcoding, geometric morphometrics, and artificial intelligence. Here, data related to the three approaches are reviewed. DNA barcoding involves an analysis of a barcode sequence. It was used to diagnose medical parasites and arthropods with 95.0% accuracy. However, this technique still requires costly reagents and equipment. Geometric morphometric analysis is the statistical analysis of the patterns of shape change of an anatomical structure. Its accuracy is approximately 94.0-100.0%, and unlike DNA barcoding, costly reagents and equipment are not required. Artificial intelligence technology involves the analysis of pictures using well-trained algorithms. It showed 98.8-99.0% precision. All three approaches use computer programs instead of human interpretation. They also have the potential to be high-throughput technologies since many samples can be analyzed at once. However, the limitation of using these techniques in real settings is species coverage.", "The COVID-19 pandemic is raging. It revealed the importance of rapid scientific advancement towards understanding and treating new diseases. To address this challenge, we adapt an explainable artificial intelligence algorithm for data fusion and utilize it on new omics data on viral-host interactions, human protein interactions, and drugs to better understand SARS-CoV-2 infection mechanisms and predict new drug-target interactions for COVID-19. We discover that in the human interactome, the human proteins targeted by SARS-CoV-2 proteins and the genes that are differentially expressed after the infection have common neighbors central in the interactome that may be key to the disease mechanisms. We uncover 185 new drug-target interactions targeting 49 of these key genes and suggest re-purposing of 149 FDA-approved drugs, including drugs targeting VEGF and nitric oxide signaling, whose pathways coincide with the observed COVID-19 symptoms. Our integrative methodology is universal and can enable insight into this and other serious diseases.", "This study aimed to develop a camera-based system using artificial intelligence for automated detection of pecking injuries in turkeys. Videos were recorded and split into individual images for further processing. Using specifically developed software, the injuries visible on these images were marked by humans, and a neural network was trained with these annotations. Due to unacceptable agreement between the annotations of humans and the network, several work steps were initiated to improve the training data. First, a costly work step was used to create high-quality annotations (HQA) for which multiple observers evaluated already annotated injuries. Therefore, each labeled detection had to be validated by three observers before it was saved as \"finished\", and for each image, all detections had to be verified three times. Then, a network was trained with these HQA to assist observers in annotating more data. Finally, the benefit of the work step generating HQA was tested, and it was shown that the value of the agreement between the annotations of humans and the network could be doubled. Although the system is not yet capable of ensuring adequate detection of pecking injuries, the study demonstrated the importance of such validation steps in order to obtain good training data.", "The Lower (YBT-LQ) and Upper (YBT-UQ) Quarter Y Balance Test are well established assessment tools for the examination of dynamic balance and shoulder mobility/stability, respectively. However, investigations on YBT-LQ/UQ performance in students with borderline intellectual functioning (BIF) (i.e., intelligence quotient of 70-84 etc.) are lacking. Thus, the aim of the study was to compare YBT-LQ/UQ performance in students with and without BIF. Thirty students with BIF (age: 13.7 \u00b1 1.2 years) and 30 age-/sex-matched students without BIF (age: 13.7 \u00b1 1.3 years) performed the YBT-LQ and/or YBT-UQ. Normalized maximal reach distances (% leg/arm length) per reach direction and the composite score were used as outcome measures. A univariate analysis of variance was conducted to test for significant group differences. Irrespective of limb and reach direction, students with BIF compared to those without BIF showed significantly worse YBT-LQ (p \u2264 0.001-0.031; Cohen's d = 0.57-1.26) and YBT-UQ (p \u2264 0.001-0.015; Cohen's d = 0.68-1.52) performance with moderate to large effect sizes. Due to the poorer performance levels of students with BIF, specifically tailored interventions should be developed that have the potential to improve their dynamic balance and shoulder mobility/stability.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) is often presented as a new Industrial Revolution. Many domains use AI, including molecular simulation for drug discovery. In this review, we provide an overview of ligand-protein molecular docking and how machine learning (ML), especially deep learning (DL), a subset of ML, is transforming the field by tackling the associated challenges.", "The early diagnosis of cancer can facilitate subsequent clinical patient management. Artificial intelligence (AI) has been found to be promising for improving the diagnostic process. The aim of the present study is to increase the evidence on the application of AI to the early diagnosis of oral cancer through a scoping review. A search was performed in the PubMed, Web of Science, Embase and Google Scholar databases during the period from January 2000 to December 2020, referring to the early non-invasive diagnosis of oral cancer based on AI applied to screening. Only accessible full-text articles were considered. Thirty-six studies were included on the early detection of oral cancer based on images (photographs (optical imaging and enhancement technology) and cytology) with the application of AI models. These studies were characterized by their heterogeneous nature. Each publication involved a different algorithm with potential training data bias and few comparative data for AI interpretation. Artificial intelligence may play an important role in precisely predicting the development of oral cancer, though several methodological issues need to be addressed in parallel to the advances in AI techniques, in order to allow large-scale transfer of the latter to population-based detection protocols.", "Several design parameters affect the reliability of wafer-level type advanced packaging, such as upper and lower pad sizes, solder volume, buffer layer thickness, and chip thickness, etc. Conventionally, the accelerated thermal cycling test (ATCT) is used to evaluate the reliability life of electronic packaging; however, optimizing the design parameters through ATCT is time-consuming and expensive, reducing the number of experiments becomes a critical issue. In recent years, many researchers have adopted the finite-element-based design-on-simulation (DoS) technology for the reliability assessment of electronic packaging. DoS technology can effectively shorten the design cycle, reduce costs, and effectively optimize the packaging structure. However, the simulation analysis results are highly dependent on the individual researcher and are usually inconsistent between them. Artificial intelligence (AI) can help researchers avoid the shortcomings of the human factor. This study demonstrates AI-assisted DoS technology by combining artificial intelligence and simulation technologies to predict wafer level package (WLP) reliability. In order to ensure reliability prediction accuracy, the simulation procedure was validated by several experiments prior to creating a large AI training database. This research studies several machine learning models, including artificial neural network (ANN), recurrent neural network (RNN), support vector regression (SVR), kernel ridge regression (KRR), K-nearest neighbor (KNN), and random forest (RF). These models are evaluated in this study based on prediction accuracy and CPU time consumption.", "The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic began at the end of December 2019, giving rise to a high rate of infections and causing COVID-19-associated deaths worldwide. It was first reported in Wuhan, China, and since then, not only global leaders, organizations, and pharmaceutical/biotech companies, but also researchers, have directed their efforts toward overcoming this threat. The use of artificial intelligence (AI) has recently surged internationally and has been applied to diverse aspects of many problems. The benefits of using AI are now widely accepted, and many studies have shown great success in medical research on tasks, such as the classification, detection, and prediction of disease, or even patient outcome. In fact, AI technology has been actively employed in various ways in COVID-19 research, and several clinical applications of AI-equipped medical devices for the diagnosis of COVID-19 have already been reported. Hence, in this review, we summarize the latest studies that focus on medical imaging analysis, drug discovery, and therapeutics such as vaccine development and public health decision-making using AI. This survey clarifies the advantages of using AI in the fight against COVID-19 and provides future directions for tackling the COVID-19 pandemic using AI techniques.", "More and more teams are collaborating virtually across the globe, and the COVID-19 pandemic has further encouraged the dissemination of virtual teamwork. However, there are challenges for virtual teams - such as reduced informal communication - with implications for team effectiveness. Team flow is a concept with high potential for promoting team effectiveness, however its measurement and promotion are challenging. Traditional team flow measurements rely on self-report questionnaires that require interrupting the team process. Approaches in artificial intelligence, i.e., machine learning, offer methods to identify an algorithm based on behavioral and sensor data that is able to identify team flow and its dynamics over time without interrupting the process. Thus, in this article we present an approach to identify team flow in virtual teams, using machine learning methods. First of all, based on a literature review, we provide a model of team flow characteristics, composed of characteristics that are shared with individual flow and characteristics that are unique for team flow. It is argued that those characteristics that are unique for team flow are represented by the concept of collective communication. Based on that, we present physiological and behavioral correlates of team flow which are suitable - but not limited to - being assessed in virtual teams and which can be used as input data for a machine learning system to assess team flow in real time. Finally, we suggest interventions to support team flow that can be implemented in real time, in virtual environments and controlled by artificial intelligence. This article thus contributes to finding indicators and dynamics of team flow in virtual teams, to stimulate future research and to promote team effectiveness.", "There have been significant advancements in male infertility microsurgery over time, and there continues to be significant promise for new and emerging techniques, technologies, and methodologies. In this review, we discuss the history of male infertility and the evolution of microsurgery, the essential role of education and training in male infertility microsurgery, and new technologies in this space. We also review the potentially important role of artificial intelligence (AI) in male infertility and microsurgery.", "Adolescents' perception of their own emotional abilities has been related to psychological adjustment and well-being. However, there are still few studies focusing on specific emotional dimensions in relation to bullying and well-being in adolescence. This study analysed the relationship between emotional intelligence (EI) facets, satisfaction with life, bullying and cyberbullying in adolescents. The sample consisted of 3520 high school students (51.5% females) aged between 12 and 18 years (M = 14.37; SD = 1.67). The correlation analyses showed that the majority of EI facets were positively related to satisfaction with life and negatively with both types of violence. As was expected, bullying and cyberbullying victims and bully-victims scored lower in satisfaction with life and the majority of EI facets. Controlling for sex, age, and grade, self-emotion appraisal, use of emotions and regulation of emotion were the best predictors of life satisfaction in bully-victims of bullying and cyberbullying. Finally, we discuss the relevance of these findings for clinical and educational practice on EI seeking to promote subjective well-being among adolescents involved in bullying and cyberbullying.", "Children with Cerebral Palsy (CP) often perform poorly in mathematics. It is not yet clear to what extent mathematics difficulties in this clinical condition are similar to those observed in developmental dyscalculia. To better elucidate this issue, we conducted an exploratory cross-sectional study with a sample of children and adolescents with congenital brain injuries and educational history of problems in Mathematics. Fifty students aged 7-15 years, of both genders (28 males) participated in the study, 31 with typical development (TD) and 19 of whom diagnosed with spastic CP. Nine had hemiplegia and ten diplegia. Assessment procedures included a neuropsychological battery covering numerical cognition (ZAREKI-R) and working memory (AWMA) skills, and a computerized task for comparing non-symbolic magnitudes as a measure of number sense. Despite average intelligence coefficient, participants with CP underperformed the TD in five of the 12 ZAREKI-R subtests, as well as in the number sense and working memory tasks. scores were lower among hemiplegic children compared to diplegic, numerical cognition was impaired in all CP group, unveiling a dyscalculia secondary to neurodevelopmental impairments. Therefore, we can consider that mathematical learning difficulties in CP as being heterogeneous and associated with the immaturity of neuropsychological functions, with consequences for the development of numerical cognition.", "Body composition measures derived from already available electronic medical records (computed tomography [CT] scans) can have significant value, but automation of measurements is needed for clinical implementation. We sought to use artificial intelligence to develop an automated method to measure body composition and test the algorithm on a clinical cohort to predict mortality. We constructed a deep learning algorithm using Google's DeepLabv3+ on a cohort of de-identified CT scans (n\u00a0=\u00a012,067). To test for the accuracy and clinical usefulness of the algorithm, we used a unique cohort of prospectively followed patients with cirrhosis (n\u00a0=\u00a0238) who had CT scans performed. To assess model performance, we used the confusion matrix and calculated the mean accuracy of 0.977\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.02 (0.975\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.018 for the training and test sets, respectively). To assess for spatial overlap, we measured the mean intersection over union and mean boundary contour scores and found excellent overlap between the manual and automated methods with mean scores of 0.954\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.030, 0.987\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.009, and 0.948\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.039 (0.983\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.013 for the training and test set, respectively). Using these automated measurements, we found that body composition features were predictive of mortality in patients with cirrhosis. On multivariate analysis, the addition of body composition measures significantly improved prediction of mortality for patients with cirrhosis over Model for End-Stage Liver Disease alone (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Conclusion: The measurement of body composition can be automated using artificial intelligence and add significant value for incidental CTs performed for other clinical indications. This is proof of concept that this methodology could allow for wider implementation into the clinical arena.", "Ion channels are linked to important cellular processes. For more than half a century, we have been learning various structural and functional aspects of ion channels using biological, physiological, biochemical, and biophysical principles and techniques. In recent days, bioinformaticians and biophysicists having the necessary expertise and interests in computer science techniques including versatile algorithms have started covering a multitude of physiological aspects including especially evolution, mutations, and genomics of functional channels and channel subunits. In these focused research areas, the use of artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) algorithms and associated models have been found very popular. With the help of available articles and information, this review provide an introduction to this novel research trend. Ion channel understanding is usually made considering the structural and functional perspectives, gating mechanisms, transport properties, channel protein mutations, etc. Focused research on ion channels and related findings over many decades accumulated huge data which may be utilized in a specialized scientific manner to fast conclude pinpointed aspects of channels. AI, ML, and DL techniques and models may appear as helping tools. This review aims at explaining the ways we may use the bioinformatics techniques and thus draw a few lines across the avenue to let the ion channel features appear clearer.", "The digital health revolution is transforming the landscape of medicine through innovations in sensor data, software, and wireless communication tools. As one of the most prevalent chronic diseases in the United States, diabetes is particularly impactful as a model disease for which to apply innovation. As with any other newly developed technologies, there are three key questions to consider: 1) How can the technology benefit people with diabetes?, 2) What barriers must be overcome to further advance the technology?, and 3) How will the technology be applied in the future?. In this article, we highlight six areas of innovation that have the potential to reduce the burden of diabetes for individuals living with the condition and their families as well as provide measurable benefits for all stakeholders involved in diabetes care. The six technologies which have the potential to transform diabetes care are (i) telehealth, (ii) incorporation of diabetes digital data into the electronic health record, (iii) qualitative hypoglycemia alarms, (iv) artificial intelligence, (v) cybersecurity of diabetes devices, and (vi) diabetes registries. To be successful, a new digital health technology must be accessible and affordable. Furthermore, the people and communities that would most likely benefit from the technology must be willing to use the innovation in their management of diabetes.", "Digital technologies such as chatbots can be used in the field of mental health. In particular, chatbots can be used to support citizens living in sparsely populated areas who face problems such as poor access to mental health services, lack of 24/7 support, barriers to engagement, lack of age appropriate support and reductions in health budgets. The aim of this study was to establish if user groups can design content for a chatbot to support the mental wellbeing of individuals in rural areas. University students and staff, mental health professionals and mental health service users (N\u2009=\u200978 total) were recruited to workshops across Northern Ireland, Ireland, Scotland, Finland and Sweden. The findings revealed that participants wanted a positive chatbot that was able to listen, support, inform and build a rapport with users. Gamification could be used within the chatbot to increase user engagement and retention. Content within the chatbot could include validated mental health scales and appropriate response triggers, such as signposting to external resources should the user disclose potentially harmful information or suicidal intent. Overall, the workshop participants identified user needs which can be transformed into chatbot requirements. Responsible design of mental healthcare chatbots should consider what users want or need, but also what chatbot features artificial intelligence can competently facilitate and which features mental health professionals would endorse.", "Technologies such as machine learning and artificial intelligence have brought about a tremendous change to biomedical computing and intelligence health care. As a principal component of the intelligence healthcare system, the hospital information system (HIS) has provided great convenience to hospitals and patients, but incidents of leaking private information of patients through HIS occasionally occur at times. Therefore, it is necessary to properly control excessive access behavior. To reduce the risk of patient privacy leakage when medical data are accessed, this article proposes a dynamic permission intelligent access control model that introduces credit line calculation. According to the target given by the doctor in HIS and the actual access record, the International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10 code is used to describe the degree of correlation, and the rationality of the access is formally described by a mathematical formula. The concept of intelligence healthcare credit lines is redefined with relevance and time Windows. The access control policy matches the corresponding credit limit and credit interval according to the authorization rules to achieve the purpose of intelligent control. Finally, with the actual data provided by a Grade-III Level-A hospital in Kunming, the program code is written through machine learning and biomedical computing-related technologies to complete the experimental test. The experiment proves that the intelligent access control model based on credit computing proposed in this study can play a role in protecting the privacy of patients to a certain extent.", "Crustacean farming is a fast-growing sector and has contributed to improving incomes. Many studies have focused on how to improve crustacean production. Information about crustacean behavior is important in this respect. Manual methods of detecting crustacean behavior are usually infectible, time-consuming, and imprecise. Therefore, automatic growth situation monitoring according to changes in behavior has gained more attention, including acoustic technology, machine vision, and sensors. This article reviews the development of these automatic behavior monitoring methods over the past three decades and summarizes their domains of application, as well as their advantages and disadvantages. Furthermore, the challenges of individual sensitivity and aquaculture environment for future research on the behavior of crustaceans are also highlighted. Studies show that feeding behavior, movement rhythms, and reproduction behavior are the three most important behaviors of crustaceans, and the applications of information technology such as advanced machine vision technology have great significance to accelerate the development of new means and techniques for more effective automatic monitoring. However, the accuracy and intelligence still need to be improved to meet intensive aquaculture requirements. Our purpose is to provide researchers and practitioners with a better understanding of the state of the art of automatic monitoring of crustacean behaviors, pursuant of supporting the implementation of smart crustacean farming applications.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) has revolutionized the medical diagnostic process of various diseases. Since the manual reading of capsule endoscopy videos is a time-intensive, error-prone process, computerized algorithms have been introduced to automate this process. Over the past decade, the evolution of convolutional neural network (CNN) enabled AI to detect multiple lesions simultaneously with increasing accuracy and sensitivity. Difficulty in validating CNN performance and unique characteristics of capsule endoscopy images make computer-aided reading systems in capsule endoscopy still on a preclinical level. Although AI technology can be used as an auxiliary second observer in capsule endoscopy, it is expected that in the near future, it will effectively reduce the reading time and ultimately become an independent, integrated reading system.", "In recent years, intelligent medical communication technology has developed rapidly, and the advancement of hardware technology has accelerated the development of software technology. Physical exercise breaks the limits of all aspects of the human body and requires scientific and reliable information. Industrial cameras realize collection and high-resolution image processing functions and use artificial intelligence to create conditions for collecting scientific data. With the powerful driving force of artificial intelligence, it is believed that physical education will develop to a new height. The intellectualization of physical education makes people expect that it will also bring some inevitable problems, but as long as we continue to overcome and improve, we believe that artificial intelligence will better serve physical education and benefit mankind. Artificial intelligence is the current trend of social development. This paper takes physical education as a breakthrough point to discuss the application of artificial intelligence in physical education. This paper uses the grey GM prediction model and questionnaire survey method to build an online education platform and develop an effective education model, which can integrate the country's best educational resources and reduce time and space constraints. Providing a relaxing learning environment for education, one can learn anytime, anywhere. In a typical physical education system, the average self-efficacy score is converted from 20.48 points to 68.37 points, and the average self-score of physical education in the integrated artificial intelligence environment is converted from 30.25 points to 75.54 points. The data show that the quality of education has greatly improved.", "Preventing respiratory failure is crucial in a large proportion of COVID-19 patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus pneumonia termed as Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia (NCP). Rapid diagnosis and detection of high-risk patients for effective interventions have been shown to be troublesome. Using a large, computed tomography (CT) database, we developed an artificial intelligence (AI) parameter to diagnose NCP and distinguish it from other kinds of pneumonia and traditional controls. The literature was studied and analyzed from diverse assets which include Scopus, Nature medicine, IEEE, Google scholar, Wiley Library, and PubMed. The search terms used were 'COVID-19', 'AI', 'diagnosis', and 'prognosis'. To strengthen the overall performance of AI in COVID-19 diagnosis and prognosis, we segregated several components to perceive threats and opportunities, as well as their inter-dependencies that affect the healthcare sector. This paper seeks to pick out the crucial fulfillment of factors for AI with inside the healthcare sector in the Indian context. Using critical literature review and experts' opinion, a total of 11 factors affecting COVID-19 diagnosis and prognosis were detected, and we eventually used an interpretive structural model (ISM) to build a framework of interrelationships among the identified factors. Finally, the matrice d'impacts crois\u00e9s multiplication appliqu\u00e9e \u00e1 un classment (MICMAC) analysis resulted the driving and dependence powers of these identified factors. Our analysis will help healthcare stakeholders to realize the requirements for successful implementation of AI.", "The concentration of soluble salts in surface water and rivers such as sodium, sulfate, chloride, magnesium ions, etc., plays an important role in the water salinity. Therefore, accurate determination of the distribution pattern of these ions can improve better management of drinking water resources and human health. The main goal of this research is to establish two novel wavelet-complementary intelligence paradigms so-called wavelet least square support vector machine coupled with improved simulated annealing (W-LSSVM-ISA) and the wavelet extended Kalman filter integrated with artificial neural network (W-EKF- ANN) for accurate forecasting of the monthly), magnesium (Mg+2), and sulfate (SO4-2) indices at Maroon River, in Southwest of Iran. The monthly River flow (Q), electrical conductivity (EC), Mg+2, and SO4-2 data recorded at Tange-Takab station for the period 1980-2016. Some preprocessing procedures consisting of specifying the number of lag times and decomposition of the existing original signals into multi-resolution sub-series using three mother wavelets were performed to develop predictive models. In addition, the best subset regression analysis was designed to separately assess the best selective combinations for Mg+2 and SO4-2. The statistical metrics and authoritative validation approaches showed that both complementary paradigms yielded promising accuracy compared with standalone artificial intelligence (AI) models. Furthermore, the results demonstrated that W-LSSVM-ISA-C1 (correlation coefficient (R)\u00a0=\u00a00.9521, root mean square error (RMSE)\u00a0=\u00a00.2637\u00a0mg/l, and Kling-Gupta efficiency (KGE)\u00a0=\u00a00.9361) and W-LSSVM-ISA-C4 (R\u00a0=\u00a00.9673, RMSE\u00a0=\u00a00.5534\u00a0mg/l and KGE\u00a0=\u00a00.9437), using Dmey mother that outperformed the W-EKF-ANN for predicting Mg+2 and SO4-2, respectively.", "In recent years, the evolution of artificial intelligence, especially deep learning, has been remarkable, and its application to various fields has been growing rapidly. In this paper, I report the results of the application of generative adversarial networks (GANs), specifically video-to-video translation networks, to computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. The purpose of this research is to reduce the computational cost of CFD simulations with GANs. The architecture of GANs in this research is a combination of the image-to-image translation networks (the so-called \"pix2pix\") and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). It is shown that the results of high-cost and high-accuracy simulations (with high-resolution computational grids) can be estimated from those of low-cost and low-accuracy simulations (with low-resolution grids). In particular, the time evolution of density distributions in the cases of a high-resolution grid is reproduced from that in the cases of a low-resolution grid through GANs, and the density inhomogeneity estimated from the image generated by GANs recovers the ground truth with good accuracy. Qualitative and quantitative comparisons of the results of the proposed method with those of several super-resolution algorithms are also presented.", "Patient similarity search is a fundamental and important task in artificial intelligence-assisted medicine service, which is beneficial to medical diagnosis, such as making accurate predictions for similar diseases and recommending personalized treatment plans. Existing patient similarity search methods retrieve medical events associated with patients from Electronic Health Record (EHR) data and map them to vectors. The similarity between patients is expressed by calculating the similarity or dissimilarity between the corresponding vectors of medical events, thereby completing the patient similarity measurement. However, the obtained vectors tend to be high dimensional and sparse, which makes it hard to calculate patient similarity accurately. In addition, most of existing methods cannot capture the time information in the EHR, which is not conducive to analyzing the influence of time factors on patient similarity search. To solve these problems, we propose a patient similarity search method based on a heterogeneous information network. On the one hand, the proposed method uses a heterogeneous information network to connect patients, diseases, and drugs, which solves the problem of vector representation of mixed information related to patients, diseases, and drugs. Meanwhile, our method measures the similarity between patients by calculating the similarity between nodes in the heterogeneous information network. In this way, the challenges caused by high-dimensional and sparse vectors can be addressed. On the other hand, the proposed method solves the problem of inaccurate patient similarity search caused by the lack of use of time information in the patient similarity measurement process by encoding time information into an annotated heterogeneous information network. Experiments show that our method is better than the compared baseline methods.", "This study aimed to examine the impact of implementing an innovative Social-Emotional Skills Training Program in physical education classes at youth schools. This study used two surveys: the Schutte Self-Report Inventory (otherwise known as the Emotional Intelligence Scale) and the Social Skills Rating System (student form). The analysis included 104 youth school students (Mage = 16.91; SD = 1.12), who were randomly selected from two youth schools in the Kaunas region. Four classes were randomly assigned into an experimental (n = 49) and a control (n = 55) group. The experimental group participated in the Social-Emotional Skills Training Program. The intervention was targeted at the following social-emotional skills: empathy, cooperation, assertion, self-control, optimism, ability to understand and analyze emotions, appraisal, and utilization of emotions. The modified physical education classes were conducted by the physical education teacher, who was instructed by the researcher. Repeated measures multivariate ANOVA was used to analyze the effects of the Social-Emotional Skills Training Program. During the experiment, the applied training procedures had a statistically significant effect on the social-emotional skills of the experimental group of youth school students. Thus, the findings demonstrate that this program (for enhancing social-emotional skills of youth school students) positively impacted the social-emotional skills of the students. These results highlight the need to consider social-emotional skills training factors when interpreting the level of social-emotional skills among youth school students.", "The world is still under the threat of different strains of the coronavirus and the pandemic situation is far from over. The method, that is widely used for the detection of COVID-19 is Reverse Transcription Polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), which is a time-consuming method and is prone to manual errors, and has poor precision. Although many nations across the globe have begun the mass immunization procedure, the COVID-19 vaccine will take a long time to reach everyone. The application of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) has been used in the domain of medical imaging for a long period. It is quite evident that the use of CAD in the detection of COVID-19 is inevitable. The main objective of this paper is to use convolutional neural network (CNN) and a novel feature selection technique to analyze Chest X-Ray (CXR) images for the detection of COVID-19. We propose a novel two-tier feature selection method, which increases the accuracy of the overall classification model used for screening COVID-19 CXRs. Filter feature selection models are often more effective than wrapper methods as wrapper methods tend to be computationally more expensive and are not useful for large datasets dealing with a large number of features. However, most filter methods do not take into consideration how a group of features would work together, rather they just look at the features individually and decide on a score. We have used approximate Shapley value, a concept of Coalition game theory, to deal with this problem. Further, in the case of a large dataset, it is important to work with shorter embeddings of the features. We have used CUR decomposition and Nystrom sampling to further reduce the feature space. To check the efficacy of this two-tier feature selection method, we have applied it to the features extracted by three standard deep learning models, namely VGG16, Xception and InceptionV3, where the features have been extracted from the CXR images of COVID-19 datasets and we have found that the selection procedure works quite well for the features extracted by Xception and InceptionV3. The source code of this work is available at https://github.com/subhankar01/covidfs-aihc.", "In genetics and related fields, huge amounts of data, such as genome sequences, are accumulating, and the use of artificial intelligence (AI) suitable for big data analysis has become increasingly important. Unsupervised AI that can reveal novel knowledge from big data without prior knowledge or particular models is highly desirable for analyses of genome sequences, particularly for obtaining unexpected insights. We have developed a batch-learning self-organizing map (BLSOM) for oligonucleotide compositions that can reveal various novel genome characteristics. Here, we explain the data mining by the BLSOM: an unsupervised AI. As a specific target, we first selected SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) because a large number of viral genome sequences have been accumulated via worldwide efforts. We analyzed more than 0.6 million sequences collected primarily in the first year of the pandemic. BLSOMs for short oligonucleotides (e.g., 4-6-mers) allowed separation into known clades, but longer oligonucleotides further increased the separation ability and revealed subgrouping within known clades. In the case of 15-mers, there is mostly one copy in the genome; thus, 15-mers that appeared after the epidemic started could be connected to mutations, and the BLSOM for 15-mers revealed the mutations that contributed to separation into known clades and their subgroups. After introducing the detailed methodological strategies, we explain BLSOMs for various topics, such as the tetranucleotide BLSOM for over 5 million 5-kb fragment sequences derived from almost all microorganisms currently available and its use in metagenome studies. We also explain BLSOMs for various eukaryotes, including fishes, frogs and Drosophila species, and found a high separation ability among closely related species. When analyzing the human genome, we found enrichments in transcription factor-binding sequences in centromeric and pericentromeric heterochromatin regions. The tDNAs (tRNA genes) could be separated according to their corresponding amino acid.", "There is an ever-growing mismatch between the proliferation of data-intensive, power-hungry deep learning solutions in the machine learning (ML) community and the need for agile, portable solutions in resource-constrained devices, particularly for intelligence at the edge. In this paper, we present a fundamentally novel approach that leverages data-driven intelligence with biologically-inspired efficiency. The proposed Sparse Embodiment Neural-Statistical Architecture (SENSA) decomposes the learning task into two distinct phases: a training phase and a hardware embedment phase where prototypes are extracted from the trained network and used to construct fast, sparse embodiment for hardware deployment at the edge. Specifically, we propose the Sparse Pulse Automata via Reproducing Kernel (SPARK) method, which first constructs a learning machine in the form of a dynamical system using energy-efficient spike or pulse trains, commonly used in neuroscience and neuromorphic engineering, then extracts a rule-based solution in the form of automata or lookup tables for rapid deployment in edge computing platforms. We propose to use the theoretically-grounded unifying framework of the Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) to provide interpretable, nonlinear, and nonparametric solutions, compared to the typical neural network approach. In kernel methods, the explicit representation of the data is of secondary nature, allowing the same algorithm to be used for different data types without altering the learning rules. To showcase SPARK's capabilities, we carried out the first proof-of-concept demonstration on the task of isolated-word automatic speech recognition (ASR) or keyword spotting, benchmarked on the TI-46 digit corpus. Together, these energy-efficient and resource-conscious techniques will bring advanced machine learning solutions closer to the edge.", "Maternal intake of several nutrients during pregnancy is linked to offspring cognition. The relation between maternal dietary patterns and offspring cognition is less established.\nWe aimed to examine associations of maternal diet quality during pregnancy with child cognition and behavior.\nAmong 1580 mother-child pairs in Project Viva, a prospective prebirth cohort, we assessed maternal diet during pregnancy using FFQs and evaluated diet quality using versions modified for pregnancy of the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS-P) and Alternate Healthy Eating Index (AHEI-P). Child cognitive and behavioral outcomes were assessed using standardized tests and questionnaires at infancy and in early and mid-childhood. We conducted multivariable linear regression analyses.\nMothers were predominantly white, college-educated, and nonsmokers. After adjustment for child age and sex and maternal sociodemographic and lifestyle characteristics, maternal high (6-9) compared with low (0-3) MDS-P during pregnancy was associated with higher child Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test (KBIT-II) nonverbal (mean difference for first trimester: 4.54; 95% CI: 1.53, 7.56) and verbal scores (3.78; 95% CI: 1.37, 6.19) and lower Behavioral Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF) Metacognition Index (-1.76; 95% CI: -3.25, -0.27), indicating better intelligence and fewer metacognition problems in mid-childhood. Maternal Q4 compared with Q1 AHEI-P during pregnancy was associated with higher Wide Range Assessment of Visual Motor Abilities matching scores in early childhood (mean difference for first trimester: 2.79; 95% CI: 0.55, 5.04) and higher KBIT-II verbal scores (2.59; 95% CI: 0.13, 5.04) and lower BRIEF Global Executive Composite scores in mid-childhood (-1.61; 95% CI: -3.20, -0.01), indicating better visual spatial skills, verbal intelligence, and executive function.\nMaternal intake of a better-quality diet during pregnancy was associated with better visual spatial skills in the offspring at early childhood and with better intelligence and executive function in the offspring at mid-childhood.", "Artificial Intelligence (AI) relies upon a convergence of technologies with further synergies with life science technologies to capture the value of massive multi-modal data in the form of predictive models supporting decision-making. AI and machine learning (ML) enhance drug design and development by improving our understanding of disease heterogeneity, identifying dysregulated molecular pathways and therapeutic targets, designing and optimizing drug candidates, as well as evaluating in silico clinical efficacy. By providing an unprecedented level of knowledge on both patient specificities and drug candidate properties, AI is fostering the emergence of a computational precision medicine allowing the design of therapies or preventive measures tailored to the singularities of individual patients in terms of their physiology, disease features, and exposure to environmental risks.", "The Radiology Research Alliance (RRA) of the Association of University Radiologists (AUR) convenes Task Forces to address current topics in radiology. In this article, the AUR-RRA Task Force on Academic-Industry Partnerships for Artificial Intelligence, considered issues of importance to academic radiology departments contemplating industry partnerships in artificial intelligence (AI) development, testing and evaluation. Our goal was to create a framework encompassing the domains of clinical, technical, regulatory, legal and financial considerations that impact the arrangement and success of such partnerships.", "X-ray screening is an important tool in tuberculosis (TB) prevention and care, but access has historically been restricted by its immobile nature. As recent advancements have improved the portability of modern X-ray systems, this study represents an early evaluation of the safety, image quality and yield of using an ultra-portable X-ray system for active case finding (ACF). We reported operational and radiological performance characteristics and compared image quality between the ultra-portable and two reference systems. Image quality was rated by three human readers and by an artificial intelligence (AI) software. We deployed the ultra-portable X-ray alongside the reference system for community-based ACF and described TB care cascades for each system. The ultra-portable system operated within advertised specifications and radiologic tolerances, except on X-ray capture capacity, which was 58% lower than the reported maximum of 100 exposures per charge. The mean image quality rating from radiologists for the ultra-portable system was significantly lower than the reference (3.71 vs. 3.99, p < 0.001). However, we detected no significant differences in TB abnormality scores using the AI software (p = 0.571), nor in any of the steps along the TB care cascade during our ACF campaign. Despite some shortcomings, ultra-portable X-ray systems have significant potential to improve case detection and equitable access to high-quality TB care.", "Artificial intelligence [AI] techniques are quickly spreading across medicine as an analytical method to tackle challenging clinical questions. What were previously thought of as highly complex data sources, such as images or free text, are now becoming manageable. Novel analytical methods merge the latest developments in information technology infrastructure with advances in computer science. Once primarily associated with Silicon Valley, AI techniques are now making their way into medicine, including in the field of inflammatory bowel diseases [IBD]. Understanding potential applications and limitations of these techniques can be difficult, in particular for busy clinicians. In this article, we explain the basic terminologies and provide a particular focus on the foundations behind state-of-the-art AI methodologies in both imaging and text. We explore the growing applications of AI in medicine, with a specific focus on IBD to inform the practising gastroenterologist and IBD specialist. Finally, we outline possible future uses of these technologies in daily clinical practice.", "Personal Activity Intelligence (PAI) is a new metric for physical activity tracking, and is associated with reduced risk of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. We prospectively investigated whether PAI is associated with lower body weight gain in a healthy population.\nWe included 85,243 participants (40,037 men and 45,206 women) who participated in at least one of three waves of the Tr\u00f8ndelag Health Study (HUNT1: 1984-86, HUNT2: 1995-97, and HUNT3: 2006-08). We used questionnaires to estimate PAI, and linear mixed models to examine body weight according to PAI levels at three study waves. We also conducted regression analyses to assess separate relationships between change in PAI and the combined changes in PAI and physical activity recommendations, according to body weight from HUNT1 to HUNT3.\nCompared with HUNT1, body weight was 8.6 and 6.7 kg higher at HUNT3 for men and women, respectively, but was lower among those with \u2265200 PAI at HUNT3. For both sexes, a change from inactive (0 PAI) at HUNT1 to \u2265100 weekly PAI-score at HUNT2 and HUNT3, and a \u2265100 PAI-score at all three occasions were associated with lower body weight gain, compared with the reference group (0 PAI at all three waves). Importantly, among both sexes, obtaining \u2265100 weekly PAI at HUNT1 and HUNT3 was associated with lower body weight gain regardless of adhering to physical activity guidelines.\nAdhering to a high PAI over time may be a useful tool to attenuate excessive body weight gain in a population free from cardiovascular disease.\nNorwegian Research Council and the Liaison Committee between the Central Norway Regional Health Authority and the Norwegian University of Science and technology.", "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the domain of computer science that focuses on the development of machines that operate like humans. In the field of AI, medical disease detection is an instantly growing domain of research. In the past years, numerous endeavours have been made for the improvements of medical disease detection, because the errors and problems in medical disease detection cause serious wrong medical treatment. Meta-heuristic techniques have been frequently utilized for the detection of medical diseases and promise better accuracy of perception and prediction of diseases in the domain of biomedical. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is a swarm-based intelligent stochastic search technique encouraged from the intrinsic manner of bee swarm during the searching of their food source. Consequently, for the versatility of numerical experimentation, PSO has been mostly applied to address the diverse kinds of optimization problems. However, the PSO techniques are frequently adopted for the detection of diseases but there is still a gap in the comparative survey. This paper presents an insight into the diagnosis of medical diseases in health care using various PSO approaches. This study presents to deliver a systematic literature review of current PSO approaches for knowledge discovery in the field of disease detection. The systematic analysis discloses the potential research areas of PSO strategies as well as the research gaps, although, the main goal is to provide the directions for future enhancement and development in this area. This paper gives a systematic survey of this conceptual model for the advanced research, which has been explored in the specified literature to date. This review comprehends the fundamental concepts, theoretical foundations, and conventional application fields. It is predicted that our study will be beneficial for the researchers to review the PSO algorithms in-depth for disease detection. Several challenges that can be undertaken to move the field forward are discussed according to the current state of the PSO strategies in health care.", "The development of reliable and robust diagnostic tests is one of the most efficient methods to limit the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, most laboratory diagnostics for COVID-19, such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), are expensive, time-consuming, and require highly trained professional operators. On the other hand, the lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) is a simpler, cheaper device that can be operated by unskilled personnel easily. Unfortunately, the current technique has some limitations, mainly inaccuracy in detection. This review article aims to highlight recent advances in novel lateral flow technologies for detecting SARS-CoV-2 as well as innovative approaches to achieve highly sensitive and specific point-of-care testing. Lastly, we discuss future perspectives on how smartphones and Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be integrated to revolutionize disease detection as well as disease control and surveillance.", "In recent years, synthesizing drugs powered by artificial intelligence has brought great convenience to society.

Deep learning has been an efficient artificial intelligence tool for food and agro-products. Hyperspectral imaging coupled with deep learning was applied to determine the maturity degree and soluble solids content (SSC) of strawberries with four maturity degrees. Hyperspectral image of each strawberry was obtained and preprocessed, and the spectra were extracted from the images. One-dimension residual neural network (1D ResNet) and three-dimension (3D) ResNet were built using 1D spectra and 3D hyperspectral image as inputs for maturity degree evaluation. Good performances were obtained for maturity identification, with the classification accuracy over 84% for both 1D ResNet and 3D ResNet. The corresponding saliency maps showed that the pigments related wavelengths and image regions contributed more to the maturity identification. For SSC determination, 1D ResNet model was also built, with the determination of coefficient (R 2) over 0.55 of the training, validation, and testing sets. The saliency maps of 1D ResNet for the SSC determination were also explored. The overall results showed that deep learning could be used to identify strawberry maturity degree and determine SSC. More efforts were needed to explore the use of 3D deep learning methods for the SSC determination. The close results of 1D ResNet and 3D ResNet for classification indicated that more samples might be used to improve the performances of 3D ResNet. The results in this study would help to develop 1D and 3D deep learning models for fruit quality inspection and other researches using hyperspectral imaging, providing efficient analysis approaches of fruit quality inspection using hyperspectral imaging.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) in drug discovery and development (DDD) has gained more traction in the past few years. Many scientific reviews have already been made available in this area. Thus, in this review, the authors have focused on the success stories of AI-driven drug candidates and the scientometric analysis of the literature in this field.\nThe authors explore the literature to compile the success stories of AI-driven drug candidates that are currently being assessed in clinical trials or have investigational new drug (IND) status. The authors also provide the reader with their expert perspectives for future developments and their opinions on the field.\nPartnerships between AI companies and the pharma industry are booming. The early signs of the impact of AI on DDD are encouraging, and the pharma industry is hoping for breakthroughs. AI can be a promising technology to unveil the greatest successes, but it has yet to be proven as AI is still at the embryonic stage.", "Clinical classification models are mostly pathology-dependent and, thus, are only able to detect pathologies they have been trained for. Research is needed regarding pathology-independent classifiers and their interpretation. Hence, our aim is to develop a pathology-independent classifier that provides prediction probabilities and explanations of the classification decisions. Spinal posture data of healthy subjects and various pathologies (back pain, spinal fusion, osteoarthritis), as well as synthetic data, were used for modeling. A one-class support vector machine was used as a pathology-independent classifier. The outputs were transformed into a probability distribution according to Platt's method. Interpretation was performed using the explainable artificial intelligence tool Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations. The results were compared with those obtained by commonly used binary classification approaches. The best classification results were obtained for subjects with a spinal fusion. Subjects with back pain were especially challenging to distinguish from the healthy reference group. The proposed method proved useful for the interpretation of the predictions. No clear inferiority of the proposed approach compared to commonly used binary classifiers was demonstrated. The application of dynamic spinal data seems important for future works. The proposed approach could be useful to provide an objective orientation and to individually adapt and monitor therapy measures pre- and post-operatively.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) offers new opportunities for objective quantitative measurements of imaging biomarkers from positron-emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT). Clinical image reporting relies predominantly on observer-dependent visual assessment and easily accessible measures like SUVmax, representing lesion uptake in a relatively small amount of tissue. Our hypothesis is that measurements of total volume and lesion uptake of the entire tumour would better reflect the disease`s activity with prognostic significance, compared with conventional measurements.\nAn AI-based algorithm was trained to automatically measure the prostate and its tumour content in PET/CT of 145 patients. The algorithm was then tested retrospectively on 285 high-risk patients, who were examined using 18F-choline PET/CT for primary staging between April 2008 and July 2015. Prostate tumour volume, tumour fraction of the prostate gland, lesion uptake of the entire tumour, and SUVmax were obtained automatically. Associations between these measurements, age, PSA, Gleason score and prostate cancer-specific survival were studied, using a Cox proportional-hazards regression model.\nTwenty-three patients died of prostate cancer during follow-up (median survival 3.8\u2009years). Total tumour volume of the prostate (p\u2009=\u20090.008), tumour fraction of the gland (p\u2009=\u20090.005), total lesion uptake of the prostate (p\u2009=\u20090.02), and age (p\u2009=\u20090.01) were significantly associated with disease-specific survival, whereas SUVmax (p\u2009=\u20090.2), PSA (p\u2009=\u20090.2), and Gleason score (p\u2009=\u20090.8) were not.\nAI-based assessments of total tumour volume and lesion uptake were significantly associated with disease-specific survival in this patient cohort, whereas SUVmax and Gleason scores were not. The AI-based approach appears well-suited for clinically relevant patient stratification and monitoring of individual therapy.", "Limited evidence is available on the clinical impact of artificial intelligence (AI) in radiology. Early health technology assessment (HTA) is a methodology to assess the potential value of an innovation at an early stage. We use early HTA to evaluate the potential value of AI software in radiology. As a use-case, we evaluate the cost-effectiveness of AI software aiding the detection of intracranial large vessel occlusions (LVO) in stroke in comparison to standard care. We used a Markov based model from a societal perspective of the United Kingdom predominantly using stroke registry data complemented with pooled outcome data from large, randomized trials. Different scenarios were explored by varying missed diagnoses of LVOs, AI costs and AI performance. Other input parameters were varied to demonstrate model robustness. Results were reported in expected incremental costs (IC) and effects (IE) expressed in quality adjusted life years (QALYs).\nApplying the base case assumptions (6% missed diagnoses of LVOs by clinicians, $40 per AI analysis, 50% reduction of missed LVOs by AI), resulted in cost-savings and incremental QALYs over the projected lifetime (IC: -\u2009$156, -\u20090.23%; IE: +\u20090.01 QALYs, +\u20090.07%) per suspected ischemic stroke patient. For each yearly cohort of patients in the UK this translates to a total cost saving of $11 million.\nAI tools for LVO detection in emergency care have the potential to improve healthcare outcomes and save costs. We demonstrate how early HTA may be applied for the evaluation of clinically applied AI software for radiology.", "The article is a scoping review of the literature on the use of decision support systems based on artificial neural networks in emergency surgery. The authors present modern literature data on the effectiveness of artificial neural networks for predicting, diagnosing and treating abdominal emergency conditions: acute appendicitis, acute pancreatitis, acute cholecystitis, perforated gastric or duodenal ulcer, acute intestinal obstruction, and strangulated hernia. The intelligent systems developed at present allow a surgeon in an emergency setting, not only to check his own diagnostic and prognostic assumptions, but also to use artificial intelligence in complex urgent clinical cases. The authors summarize the main limitations for the implementation of artificial neural networks in surgery and medicine in general. These limitations are the lack of transparency in the decision-making process; insufficient quality educational medical data; lack of qualified personnel; high cost of projects; and the complexity of secure storage of medical information data. The development and implementation of decision support systems based on artificial neural networks is a promising direction for improving the forecasting, diagnosis and treatment of emergency surgical diseases and their complications.", "Emotional intelligence training relieves stress and promotes resilience among nurses. Previous studies have not sufficiently explored the effect of emotional intelligence training among nurses on the experience of inpatients under their care.\nTo explore the effects of emotional intelligence training on emotional intelligence, resilience, and perceived stress among nurses and examine how training affects inpatient experience.\nRandomized controlled trial.\nA tertiary general hospital in Changsha, China.\nA total of 103 nurses were randomly selected from 20 wards.\nThe wards were randomized into two groups. The intervention group (n\u00a0=\u00a053 nurses) received emotional intelligence training in two phases: Phase I-system training phase, twice a week for one month; Phase II-a consolidated learning phase, once a week for 11\u00a0months. The control group (n\u00a0=\u00a050) received daily briefings in meetings between head nurses, which were held regularly to discuss specific problems. There was no emotional intelligence training conducted with the control group. Data were collected at baseline and after the intervention.\nEmotional intelligence training improved emotional intelligence, resilience, and stress in the intervention group. The control group scored lower on the Wong and Law's Emotional Intelligence Scale and all subscales, showed stability in the scores on the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale and its subscales, and very little change in stress scores. Repeated measures analysis of variance showed significantly greater beneficial changes in the intervention group on all but the optimism subscale. There were suggestive differences in the predicted direction between the emotional intelligence training wards and the control wards at post-test on the patient experience scale and the four subscales.\nOur study suggests that emotional intelligence training improves emotional intelligence, resilience, and stress among nurses and leads to improvements in inpatient experience. Emotional intelligence training should be part of nurse education to improve the quality of care nurses provide and their ability to work without increased stress.", "Cultural intelligence is one's ability to adapt when confronted with problems arising in interactions with people or artifacts of diverse cultures. In this study, we conduct an initial construct-validation and assessment of a maximum-performance test of cultural intelligence. We assess the psychometric properties of the test and also correlate the test with other measures with which it might be expected there would be some connection. We found that our test was internally consistent and correlated significantly with maximum-performance tests of abilities but generally less or not at all with typical-performance tests, including cultural intelligence and openness to experience. However, our test appears to be distinct in what it measures from the other tests of cognitive abilities. The results lead us to suggest that cultural intelligence may have both maximum-performance and typical-performance aspects.", "Getting to know Erwin Knecht is not so simple. This view was summarized in a comment from Dr. Marta Martinez Vicente, who obtained her PhD degree working in a lab that shared space with Erwin's group: \"Erwin Knecht is a complex character, who awakens contradictory feelings. To define him I would say that he is a mixture of intelligence and madness, he's witty, very funny but also grumpy and cranky, all mixed and all simultaneously. Without a doubt he is a person who will not leave anyone indifferent, his original personality marked all who crossed his path, doctoral students, collaborators, people who attended his talks, etc \u2026 I remember the weekly lab meetings with him; we, the students, had a lot of respect for him (not to mention fear), but his comments were always smart, helpful and constructive, he has always been prone to helping everyone. In the lab, he was extremely demanding, but got people under his supervision to do their best. And despite his usual moodiness, he managed to make everyone love him and have a special affection for him. Above all, I remember his screams throughout the laboratory that could be heard from all over the building, calling out to his laboratory technician: 'Asunci\u00f3n!' They were like an old couple, arguing all day but they couldn't be without each other, it was like watching a sitcom every day.\" If you are intrigued, please read on.", "The cognitive predictors of academic achievement are associated both with basic cognitive abilities such as the information processing speed, number sense and visuospatial working memory, as well as with general ability including nonverbal intelligence. However, the ratio between cognitive development and school achievement can depend on sociocultural conditions.\nThe results of a cross-cultural analysis of the relationship between cognitive development and academic achievement during primary education are presented. The analysis was conducted sampling schoolchildren from Russia and Kyrgyzstan, two countries that have a similar organization of the national education system but differ in the level of socioeconomic development.\nThe study involved 732 schoolchildren aged 7.7 to 11.8 years studying in Russia and Kyrgyzstan. Information processing speed, visuospatial working memory, and number sense were assessed using each of \"Choice Reaction Time,\" \"Corsi Block-Tapping Test,\" and \"Number Sense\" computerized tests.\nAccording to the results, empirical data in both samples show that a model where in information processing speed signifies basic cognitive ability is a key predictor of nonverbal intelligence, working memory, and number sense, and each of these may contribute to individual differences in academic achievement. Notwithstanding the universality of this model, cross-cultural differences were seen to engender a reduction of schoolchildren's academic achievements, given possible impacts of less favorable educational conditions.\nIn the relationship between cognitive abilities and academic success at the primary school education, there are both similarities and differences between schoolchildren studying in Russia and Kyrgyzstan.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) is used to learn the key voltammetric characteristics of the dissociative CE mechanism via training from multiple simulations using bespoke code. This allows first for the prediction of voltammograms without the need for further simulations, given knowledge of the relevant experimental parameters (rate and equilibrium constants, electrode geometry, and diffusion coefficients). Second, it is applied to analyze noisy experimental voltammetry to characterize the mechanistic type and to successfully extract the key kinetic and thermodynamic parameters.", "Accurate assessment of mitral regurgitation (MR) severity is critical in clinical diagnosis and treatment. No single echocardiographic method has been recommended for MR quantification thus far. We sought to define the feasibility and accuracy of the mask regions with a convolutional neural network (Mask R-CNN) algorithm in the automatic qualitative evaluation of MR using color Doppler echocardiography images. The authors collected 1132 cases of MR from hospital A and 295 cases of MR from hospital B and divided them into the following four types according to the 2017 American Society of Echocardiography (ASE) guidelines: grade I (mild), grade II (moderate), grade III (moderate), and grade IV (severe). Both grade II and grade III are moderate. After image marking with the LabelMe software, a method using the Mask R-CNN algorithm based on deep learning (DL) was used to evaluate MR severity. We used the data from hospital A to build the artificial intelligence (AI) model and conduct internal verification, and we used the data from hospital B for external verification. According to severity, the accuracy of classification was 0.90, 0.89, and 0.91 for mild, moderate, and severe MR, respectively. The Macro F1 and Micro F1 coefficients were 0.91 and 0.92, respectively. According to grading, the accuracy of classification was 0.90, 0.87, 0.81, and 0.91 for grade I, grade II, grade III, and grade IV, respectively. The Macro F1 and Micro F1 coefficients were 0.89 and 0.89, respectively. Automatic assessment of MR severity is feasible with the Mask R-CNN algorithm and color Doppler electrocardiography images collected in accordance with the 2017 ASE guidelines, and the model demonstrates reasonable performance and provides reliable qualitative results for MR severity.", "Accurate assessment of pain by health-care professionals is essential to ensure optimal management of pain. An under-researched area is whether personality characteristics affect perception of pain in others. The aims were (a) to determine whether individual differences are associated with participants' ability to assess pain, and (b) to determine facial cues used in the assessment of pain. One hundred and twenty-eight undergraduate students participated. They completed questionnaire assessments of empathy, pain catastrophizing, sensory sensitivity and emotional intelligence. They then viewed and rated four adult facial images (no, medium, and high pain-12 images total) using a 0-10 numerical rating scale, and noted the reasons for their ratings. (a) Empathy was the only characteristic associated with accuracy of pain assessment. (b) Descriptions of eyes and mouth, and eyes alone were most commonly associated with assessment accuracy. This was the case despite variations in the expression of pain in the four faces. Future studies could evaluate the effect on accuracy of pain assessment of (a) training empathic skills for pain assessment, and (b) emphasizing attention to the eyes, and eyes and mouth.", "This review focuses on reviewing the recent publications of swarm intelligence algorithms (particle swarm optimization (PSO), ant colony optimization (ACO), artificial bee colony (ABC), and the firefly algorithm (FA)) in scheduling and optimization problems. Swarm intelligence (SI) can be described as the intelligent behavior of natural living animals, fishes, and insects. In fact, it is based on agent groups or populations in which they have a reliable connection among them and with their environment. Inside such a group or population, each agent (member) performs according to certain rules that make it capable of maximizing the overall utility of that certain group or population. It can be described as a collective intelligence among self-organized members in certain group or population. In fact, biology inspired many researchers to mimic the behavior of certain natural swarms (birds, animals, or insects) to solve some computational problems effectively.\nSI techniques were utilized in cloud computing environment seeking optimum scheduling strategies. Hence, the most recent publications (2015-2021) that belongs to SI algorithms are reviewed and summarized.\nIt is clear that the number of algorithms for cloud computing optimization is increasing rapidly. The number of PSO, ACO, ABC, and FA related journal papers has been visibility increased. However, it is noticeably that many recently emerging algorithms were emerged based on the amendment on the original SI algorithms especially the PSO algorithm.\nThe major intention of this work is to motivate interested researchers to develop and innovate new SI-based solutions that can handle complex and multi-objective computational problems.", "To investigate the refractive outcomes of second-eye adjustment (SEA) methods in different intraocular lens (IOL) power calculation formulas for second eye following bilateral sequential cataract surgery.\nThis retrospective consecutive case-series study included 234 eyes from 234 patients who underwent bilateral sequential phacoemulsification and implantation of enVista MX60 in a hospital setting. Postoperative refraction outcomes calculated by standard formulas (SRK/T and Barrett Universal II, BUII) with SEA method were compared with those calculated by an artificial intelligence-based IOL power calculation formula (PEARL DGS) under second eye enhancement (SEE) method. The median absolute error (MedAE), mean absolute error (MAE) and percentage prediction errors (PE) of eyes within \u00b10.25 diopters (D), \u00b10.50 D, \u00b10.75 D and\u2009\u00b1\u20091.00 D were determined.\nOverall, the improvement in MedAE after SEA was significant for PEARL DGS (p\u2009<\u20090.01), SRK/T (p\u2009<\u20090.001) and BUII (p\u00a0=\u00a00.031), which increased from 74.36, 71.37, and 77.78% to 83.33, 80.34, and 79.49% of eyes within a PE of \u00b10.50 D, respectively. For first eyes with a medium axial length (22-26\u2009mm), PEARL DGS with SEE had the lowest MedAE (0.21 D). For a first-eye MAE over 0.50 D, SEA method led to significant improvement in the second eye (p\u2009<\u20090.01). Interocular axis length differences exceeding 0.3\u2009mm were associated with weaker effects using SEA in the studied formulas (p\u2009>\u20090.05).\nEither SEA method with SRK/T and BUII formulas or second-eye enhancement method based on the PEARL DGS formula can improve postoperative refractive outcomes in second eye.", "In the present study we sought to measure the relative statistical value of various multimodal CT protocols at identifying treatment responsiveness in patients being considered for thrombolysis. We used a prospectively collected cohort of acute ischemic stroke patients being assessed for IV-alteplase, who had CT-perfusion (CTP) and CT-angiography (CTA) before a treatment decision. Linear regression and receiver operator characteristic curve analysis were performed to measure the prognostic value of models incorporating each imaging modality. One thousand five hundred and sixty-two sub-4.5 h ischemic stroke patients were included in this study. A model including clinical variables, alteplase treatment, and NCCT ASPECTS was weak (R 2 0.067, P < 0.001, AUC 0.605) at predicting 90 day mRS. A second model, including dynamic CTA variables (collateral grade, occlusion severity) showed better predictive accuracy for patient outcome (R 2 0.381, P < 0.001, AUC 0.781). A third model incorporating CTP variables showed very high predictive accuracy (R 2 0.488, P < 0.001, AUC 0.899). Combining all three imaging modalities variables also showed good predictive accuracy for outcome but did not improve on the CTP model (R 2 0.439, P < 0.001, AUC 0.825). CT perfusion predicts patient outcomes from alteplase therapy more accurately than models incorporating NCCT and/or CT angiography. This data has implications for artificial intelligence or machine learning models.", "Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods have recently become critical for research in diabetes in the era of big-data science.\nIn this study, we used the data from the LOOK AHEAD and applied Random Forest to examine the factors determining SBP in persons with diabetes using the software R (version 4.0.3).\nOur analysis (that included 4723 participants) showed that maximal exercise capacity, age, albumin to creatinine ratio, and serum creatinine were the key variables that determined systolic blood pressure.\nMaximum exercise capacity is an important predictor of systolic blood pressure in patients with type 2 diabetes.", "This study was performed to analyze the accuracy of health-related information on Twitter during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Authors queried Twitter on three dates for information regarding COVID-19 and five terms (cure, emergency or emergency room, prevent or prevention, treat or treatments, vitamins or supplements) assessing the first 25 results with health-related information. Tweets were authoritative if written by governments, hospitals, or physicians. Two physicians assessed each tweet for accuracy. Metrics were compared between accurate and inaccurate tweets using \u03c7 2 analysis and Mann-Whitney U. A total of 25.4% of tweets were inaccurate. Accurate tweets were more likely written by Twitter authenticated authors (49.8% vs. 20.9%, 28.9% difference, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 17.7-38.2) with accurate tweet authors having more followers (19,491 vs. 7346; 3446 difference, 95% CI: 234-14,054) versus inaccurate tweet authors. Likes, retweets, tweet length, botometer scores, writing grade level, and rank order did not differ between accurate and inaccurate tweets. We found 1/4 of health-related COVID-19 tweets inaccurate indicating that the public should not rely on COVID-19 health information written on Twitter. Ideally, improved government regulatory authority, public/private industry oversight, independent fact-checking, and artificial intelligence algorithms are needed to ensure inaccurate information on Twitter is removed.", "The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted sporting activities across the world. However, practical training strategies for athletes to reduce the risk of infection during the pandemic have not been definitively studied. The purpose of this report was to provide an overview of the challenges we encountered during the reboot of high-performance sporting activities of the Japanese national handball team during the 3rd wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Tokyo, Japan. Twenty-nine Japanese national women's handball players and 24 staff participated in the study. To initiate the reboot of their first training camp after COVID-19 stay-home social policy, we conducted: web-based health-monitoring, SARS-CoV-2 screening with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests, real-time automated quantitative monitoring of social distancing on court using a moving image-based artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm, physical intensity evaluation with wearable heart rate (HR) and acceleration sensors, and a self-reported online questionnaire. The training camp was conducted successfully with no COVID-19 infections. The web-based health monitoring and the frequent PCR testing with short turnaround times contributed remarkably to early detection of athletes' health problems and to risk screening. During handball, AI-based on-court social-distance monitoring revealed key time-dependent spatial metrics to define player-to-player proximity. This information facilitated appropriate on- and off-game distancing behavior for teammates. Athletes regularly achieved around 80% of maximum HR during training, indicating anticipated improvements in achieving their physical intensities. Self-reported questionnaires related to the COVID management in the training camp revealed a sense of security among the athletes that allowed them to focus singularly on their training. The challenges discussed herein provided us considerable knowledge about creating and managing a safe environment for high-performing athletes in the COVID-19 pandemic via the Japan Sports-Cyber Physical System (JS-CPS) of the Sports Research Innovation Project (SRIP, Japan Sports Agency, Tokyo, Japan). This report is envisioned to provide informed decisions to coaches, trainers, policymakers from the sports federations in creating targeted, infection-free, sporting and training environments.", "At present times, COVID-19 has become a global illness and infected people has increased exponentially and it is difficult to control due to the non-availability of large quantity of testing kits. Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques including machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and computer vision (CV) approaches find useful for the recognition, analysis, and prediction of COVID-19. Several ML and DL techniques are trained to resolve the supervised learning issue. At the same time, the potential measure of the unsupervised learning technique is quite high. Therefore, unsupervised learning techniques can be designed in the existing DL models for proficient COVID-19 prediction. In this view, this paper introduces a novel unsupervised DL based variational autoencoder (UDL-VAE) model for COVID-19 detection and classification. The UDL-VAE model involved adaptive Wiener filtering (AWF) based preprocessing technique to enhance the image quality. Besides, Inception v4 with Adagrad technique is employed as a feature extractor and unsupervised VAE model is applied for the classification process. In order to verify the superior diagnostic performance of the UDL-VAE model, a set of experimentation was carried out to highlight the effective outcome of the UDL-VAE model. The obtained experimental values showcased the effectual results of the UDL-VAE model with the higher accuracy of 0.987 and 0.992 on the binary and multiple classes respectively.", "Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia worldwide, and longitudinal studies are crucial to find the factors affecting disease development. Here, we describe a novel initiative from southern Spain designed to contribute in the identification of the genetic component of the cognitive decline of Alzheimer's disease patients. The germline variant rs9320913 is a C>A substitution mapping within a gene desert. Although it has been previously associated to a higher educational achievement and increased fluid intelligence, its role on Alzheimer's disease risk and progression remains elusive. A total of 407 subjects were included in the study, comprising 153 Alzheimer disease patients and 254 healthy controls. We have explored the rs9320913 contribution to both Alzheimer disease risk and progression according to the Mini-Mental State Exams. We found that rs9320913 maps within a central nervous system lincRNA AL589740.1. eQTL results show that rs9320913 correlated with the brain-frontal cortex (beta = -0.15, p value = 0.057) and brain-spinal cord (beta of -0.23, p value = 0.037). We did not find rs9320913 to be associated to AD risk, although AA patients seemed to exhibit a less pronounced Mini-Mental State Exam score decline.", "The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of plaque-related factors on the diagnostic performance of an artificial intelligence coronary-assisted diagnosis system (AI-CADS).\nPatients who underwent coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) and invasive coronary angiography (ICA) were retrospectively included in this study. The degree of stenosis in each vessel was collected from CCTA and ICA, and the information on plaque-related factors (plaque length, plaque type, and coronary artery calcium score (CAC)) of the vessels with plaques was collected from CCTA.\nIn total, 1224 vessels in 306 patients (166 men; 65.7\u2009\u00b1\u200910.1\u00a0years) were analyzed. Of these, 391 vessels in 249 patients showed significant stenosis using ICA as the gold standard. Using per-vessel as the unit, the area under the curves of coronary stenosis\u2009\u2265\u200950% for AI-CADS, doctor, and AI-CADS\u2009+\u2009doctor was 0.764, 0.837, and 0.853, respectively. The accuracies in interpreting the degree of coronary stenosis were 56.0%, 68.1%, and 71.2%, respectively. Seven hundred fifty vessels showed plaques on CCTA; plaque type did not affect the interpretation results by AI-CADS (chi-square test: p\u2009=\u20090.0093; multiple logistic regression: p\u2009=\u20090.4937). However, the interpretation results for plaque length (chi-square test: p\u2009<\u20090.0001; multiple logistic regression: p\u2009=\u20090.0061) and CACs (chi-square test: p\u2009<\u20090.0001; multiple logistic regression: p\u2009=\u20090.0001) were significantly different.\nAI-CADS has an ability to distinguish\u2009\u2265\u200950% coronary stenosis, but additional manual interpretation based on AI-CADS is necessary. The plaque length and CACs will affect the diagnostic performance of AI-CADS.\n\u2022 AI-CADS can help radiologists quickly assess CCTA and improve diagnostic confidence. \u2022 Additional manual interpretation on the basis of AI-CADS is necessary. \u2022 The plaque length and CACs will affect the diagnostic performance of AI-CADS.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly becoming an essential tool in the medical field as well as in daily life. Recent developments in deep learning, a subfield of AI, have brought remarkable advances in image recognition, which facilitates improvement in the early detection of cancer by endoscopy, ultrasonography, and computed tomography.

Training, validation, and test datasets must be defined and set apart as priorities. External validation and testing datasets are preferable, when feasible. The specific type of learning process (supervised vs. unsupervised) and the machine learning model also require definition. Deep learning (DL) is an AI-based approach that is modelled on the structure of neurons of the brain; convolutional neural networks (CNN) are a commonly used example in neuroradiology.\nRadiomics is a frequently used approach in which a multitude of imaging features are extracted from a region of interest and subsequently reduced and selected to convey diagnostic or prognostic information. Deep radiomics uses CNNs to directly extract features and obviate the need for predefined features.\nCommon limitations and pitfalls in AI-based research in neuroradiology are limited sample sizes (\"small-n-large-p problem\"), selection bias, as well as overfitting and underfitting.", "Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is one of the most common malignant tumours of the head and neck, and improving the efficiency of its diagnosis and treatment strategies is an important goal. With the development of the combination of artificial intelligence (AI) technology and medical imaging in recent years, an increasing number of studies have been conducted on image analysis of NPC using AI tools, especially radiomics and artificial neural network methods. In this review, we present a comprehensive overview of NPC imaging research based on radiomics and deep learning. These studies depict a promising prospect for the diagnosis and treatment of NPC. The deficiencies of the current studies and the potential of radiomics and deep learning for NPC imaging are discussed. We conclude that future research should establish a large-scale labelled dataset of NPC images and that studies focused on screening for NPC using AI are necessary.", "Nursing students must learn about the core values of nursing care. Thus, education designed to improve their caring ability should be included in nursing curricula. Nursing students' caring ability is reportedly affected by emotional intelligence and resilience. However, no studies have explored whether these qualities have mediating effects on the relationship between nursing students' type D personality and their caring ability.\nTo examine the mediating effects of emotional intelligence and resilience on the relationship between type D personality and caring ability in nursing students.\nA cross-sectional, descriptive survey study.\nThe study was conducted in South Korea.\n278 nursing students.\nType D personality, emotional intelligence, resilience, and caring ability were measured using questionnaires.

We reviewed the literature to identify current AI platforms applied to neurosurgical perioperative and intraoperative settings and describe their role in multiple subspecialties.\nA systematic review of the literature was conducted following the PRISMA guidelines. PubMed, EMBASE, and Scopus databases were searched from inception to December 31st, 2020. Original articles were included if they: presented AI platforms implemented in perioperative, intraoperative settings and reported ML models' performance metrics. Due to the heterogeneity in neurosurgical applications, a qualitative synthesis was deemed appropriate. The risk of bias and applicability of predicted outcomes were assessed using the PROBAST tool.\nForty-one articles were included. All studies evaluated a supervised learning algorithm. A total of 10 ML models were described; the most frequent were neural networks (N.=15) and tree-based models (N.=13). Overall, the risk of bias was medium-high, but applicability was considered positive for all studies. Articles were grouped into four categories according to the subspecialty of interest: neuro-oncology, spine, functional and other. For each category, different prediction tasks were identified.\nIn this review, we summarize the state-of-art applications of AI for the intraoperative augmentation of neurosurgical workflows across multiple subspecialties. ML models may boost surgical team performances by reducing human errors and providing patient-tailored surgical plans, but further and higher-quality studies need to be conducted.", "From childhood to adulthood, an individual's ability to estimate and anticipate the timing of events changes continuously. This study investigated the ability of 287 children aged 5-14\u2009years to estimate the duration of prior events and anticipate the timing of future events for determination of the age at which children improve their timing skills. The Luria neuropsychological assessment battery and the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC-IV) were applied to find correlations between timing skills and the development of cognitive functions. The findings demonstrated that retrospective estimation of duration has a zone of proximal development in children between the ages of six to eight; in these children, the accuracy of time assessment significantly improved after receiving the prompt. However, improvement in time estimation was significantly lower in those children who achieved lower results in the attention and memory tests and demonstrated reduced spatial and verbal reasoning skills. The zone of proximal development for the ability to anticipate the timing of future events was demonstrated in children between the ages of nine to eleven years. The improvement of time anticipation was negatively correlated with the number of mistakes made during the dynamic praxis test.", "The advent of advances in machine learning (ML)-based techniques has popularized wide applications of artificial intelligence (AI) in various fields ranging from robotics to medicine. In recent years, there has been a surge in the application of AI to research in cardiovascular medicine, which is largely driven by the availability of large-scale clinical and multi-omics datasets. Such applications are providing a new perspective for a better understanding of cardiovascular disease (CVD), which could be used to develop novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. For example, studies have shown that ML has a substantial potential for early diagnosis of different types of CVD, prediction of adverse disease outcomes such as heart failure, and development of newer and personalized treatments. In this article, we provide an overview and discuss the current status of a wide range of AI applications, including machine learning, reinforcement learning, and deep learning, in cardiovascular medicine. \u00a9 2021 American Physiological Society. Compr Physiol 11:1-12, 2021.", "The body's innate and acquiredimmunesystems are critical in responses to a wide spectrum of assaults, including SARS-CoV-2 infection. We identify studies of autoimmunity to support our hypothesis that a high intelligence quotient (IQ) may put children at increased risk for severe COVID-19 sequelae; especially those whose viral load is high and/or who develop multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). MIS-C is associated with a higher risk of COVID-19 morbidity and death, even in otherwise healthy children. As information and evidence about SARS-CoV-2 infection continue to expand, our hypothesis suggests adding a potentially intriguing piece to the pandemic puzzle for further investigation. Drawing on a select review of published research and case reports, we discuss immune dysregulation in paediatric patients with a high IQ, including post-infection cytokine expression in the myocardium. Further, we provide a review of 27 paediatric (\u226419\u00a0years; median age 16) cases of severe COVID-19 outcomes, drawn from media sources published between March and September 2020, in which we identify possible evidence of a 'hyper brain, hyper body' response to infection. We aver these cases are noteworthy given that paediatric death with COVID-19 disease is remarkably rare, and the estimated prevalence of a high IQ (or giftedness) is only 2% in the general population. These observations warrant prospective and retrospective studies of autoinflammatory markers and mechanisms to elucidate any special psychoneuroimmunological vulnerability in children with a high IQ, as such studies may raise implications for how and when prophylactic medical care is provided to children.", "Media news during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic often entail complex numerical concepts such as exponential increase or reproduction number. This study investigated whether people have difficulties in understanding such information and whether these difficulties are related to numerical competence, reflective thinking, and risk proneness. One hundred sixty-three participants provided answers to a numeracy scale focusing on complex numerical concepts relevant to COVID-19 (COV Numeracy Scale). They also provided responses to well-established objective and subjective scales, questions about affective states, and questions about the COVID-19 pandemic. Higher scores on the COV Numeracy Scale correlated with higher scores on the Health Numeracy Scale, in the Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT), and in self-assessments of verbal comprehension, mathematical intelligence, and subjective numeracy. Interestingly, scores on the COV Numeracy Scale also positively correlated with the number of consulted information sources about COVID-19. Accuracy in the CRT emerged as a significant predictor, explaining ca. 14% of variance on the COV Numeracy Scale. The results suggest that people with lower reflective thinking skills and lower subjective and objective numerical competence can be more at disadvantage when confronted with COVID-related numerical information in everyday life. These findings advise caution in the communication of relevant public health information that entails complex numerical concepts.", "The complex physiological dynamics of neonatal seizures make their detection challenging. A timely diagnosis and treatment, especially in intensive care units, are essential for a better prognosis and the mitigation of possible adverse effects on the newborn's neurodevelopment. In the literature, several electroencephalographic (EEG) studies have been proposed for a parametric characterization of seizures or their detection by artificial intelligence techniques. At the same time, other sources than EEG, such as electrocardiography, have been investigated to evaluate the possible impact of neonatal seizures on the cardio-regulatory system. Heart rate variability (HRV) analysis is attracting great interest as a valuable tool in newborns applications, especially where EEG technologies are not easily available. This study investigated whether multiscale HRV entropy indexes could detect abnormal heart rate dynamics in newborns with seizures, especially during ictal events. Furthermore, entropy measures were analyzed to discriminate between newborns with seizures and seizure-free ones. A cohort of 52 patients (33 with seizures) from the Helsinki University Hospital public dataset has been evaluated. Multiscale sample and fuzzy entropy showed significant differences between the two groups (p-value < 0.05, Bonferroni multiple-comparison post hoc correction). Moreover, interictal activity showed significant differences between seizure and seizure-free patients (Mann-Whitney Test: p-value < 0.05). Therefore, our findings suggest that HRV multiscale entropy analysis could be a valuable pre-screening tool for the timely detection of seizure events in newborns.", "One of the most analyzed variables in educational research is prosocial behavior, given its relevance and its application in favor of a culture of peace, the construction of solid democratic societies and the development of social justice. For this reason, it is necessary to extend the knowledge of predictors of prosocial behavior so that they can be transferred to teaching practice. The research reported here was carried out using a quantitative methodology through a survey, based on data collection instruments, whose data were treated statistically by means of descriptive, correlational and predictive analyses. The results obtained suggest that emotional intelligence has a strong predictive capacity for prosocial behavior while executive functions show a mild-moderate predictive behavior. In the conclusions and discussion, we provide a series of arguments on some of the results obtained in contrast with previous literature, as well as incorporating limitations of the study and prospects for future research.", "Although the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence, Second Edition is commonly used by neuropsychologists in the assessment of intellectual functioning, there is a paucity of published literature examining its utility in detecting neurological disease/injury. This study constitutes an attempt to validate the four-subtest WASI-II (4-FSIQ) for use with patients with neurological disease/injury.\nParticipants were 59 patients referred for outpatient neuropsychological evaluation. Thirty-two individuals with diagnoses of dementia, stroke, traumatic brain injury, and other neurological disorders constituted the neurological group. A control group was comprised of 27 individuals with diagnoses of psychiatric disorders or age-related cognitive decline.\nThe WASI-II subtest and composite scores of the neurological group were all significantly (ps < .0001) lower than those of the control sample, but pattern differences between the groups were absent. When premorbid IQs and WASI-II IQs were compared, neurological patients with neurological disease/injury displayed evidence of intellectual deterioration; whereas, control participants did not.\nFindings suggest that the 4-WASI-II is sensitive to the biological condition of the brain and provide preliminary validation for its use in the neuropsychological assessment of a diagnostically heterogeneous sample of patients with neurological disorders.", "The implementation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) methodologies to drug discovery (DD) are on the rise. Several applications have been developed for structure-based DD, where AI methods provide an alternative framework for the identification of ligands for validated therapeutic targets, as well as the de novo design of ligands through generative models.\nHerein, the authors review the contributions between the 2019 to present period regarding the application of AI methods to structure-based virtual screening (SBVS) which encompasses mainly molecular docking applications - binding pose prediction and binary classification for ligand or hit identification-, as well as de novo drug design driven by machine learning (ML) generative models, and the validation of AI models in structure-based screening. Studies are reviewed in terms of their main objective, used databases, implemented methodology, input and output, and key results .\nMore profound analyses regarding the validity and applicability of AI methods in DD have begun to appear. In the near future, we expect to see more structure-based generative models- which are scarce in comparison to ligand-based generative models-, the implementation of standard guidelines for validating the generated structures, and more analyses regarding the validation of AI methods in structure-based DD.", "Objective.Deep learning-based neural decoders have emerged as the prominent approach to enable dexterous and intuitive control of neuroprosthetic hands. Yet few studies have materialized the use of deep learning in clinical settings due to its high computational requirements.Approach.Recent advancements of edge computing devices bring the potential to alleviate this problem. Here we present the implementation of a neuroprosthetic hand with embedded deep learning-based control. The neural decoder is designed based on the recurrent neural network architecture and deployed on the NVIDIA Jetson Nano-a compacted yet powerful edge computing platform for deep learning inference. This enables the implementation of the neuroprosthetic hand as a portable and self-contained unit with real-time control of individual finger movements.Main results.A pilot study with a transradial amputee is conducted to evaluate the proposed system using peripheral nerve signals acquired from implanted intrafascicular microelectrodes. The preliminary experiment results show the system's capabilities of providing robust, high-accuracy (95%-99%) and low-latency (50-120 ms) control of individual finger movements in various laboratory and real-world environments.Conclusion.This work is a technological demonstration of modern edge computing platforms to enable the effective use of deep learning-based neural decoders for neuroprosthesis control as an autonomous system.Significance.The proposed system helps pioneer the deployment of deep neural networks in clinical applications underlying a new class of wearable biomedical devices with embedded artificial intelligence.Clinical trial registration: DExterous Hand Control Through Fascicular Targeting (DEFT).

In May 2020, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has predicted nearly twice the normal number of tropical storms and hurricanes this season, while projections of COVID-19 models continue to rise in the United States as the Atlantic hurricane season progresses. Our research examines the critical intersection of hurricane response and public health in Harris County, Texas. We examine a hypothetical case of the 2017 Hurricane Harvey occurring amid the current pandemic. This research uses point of interest visitations as location intelligence data provided by SafeGraph together with Social Vulnerability Index and historical flood data to examine the critical intersection of natural hazard planning and response and the COVID-19 pandemic to assess the risks of a compound hazard situation. COVID-19 transmission hotspots and businesses in a community due to storm preparation activity were identified. The main drivers of transmission risk arise from overall pandemic exposure and increased interpersonal contact during hurricane preparation. Residents of health-risk areas will need to make logistical arrangements to visit alternative medical facilities for treatments related to either COVID-19 or physical impacts, such as injuries, due to the hurricane risks. Points of interest needed for disaster preparation are more likely to be situated in high-risk areas, therefore making cross-community spread more likely. Moreover, greater susceptibility could arise from social vulnerability (socioeconomic status and demographic factors) and disrupted access to healthcare facilities. Results from this study can be used to identify high-risk areas for COVID-19 transmission for prioritization in planning for temporary healthcare centers and other essential services in low-risk areas. Understanding the interplay between disaster preparation and the restrictive environment laid out by the pandemic is critical for community leaders and public health officials for ensuring the population has sufficient access to essential infrastructure services. The findings from this study can help guide the direction of disaster planning and pandemic response strategies and policies.", "Objectives: To explore the use of novel technologies in sperm retrieval in men with azoospermia due to a production defect. Methods: We performed a Preferred Reporting Items for Systemic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA)-compliant systemic literature review for manuscripts focussed on novel sperm-retrieval methods. We identified 30 studies suitable for qualitative analysis. Results and Conclusions: We identified multiple new promising technologies, each with its own distinct set of benefits and limitations, to enhance chances of sperm retrieval; these include the use of multiphoton microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and full-field optical coherence tomography during a microdissection-testicular sperm extraction procedure. ORBEYE and ultrasonography technologies can also serve to better visualise areas of sperm production. Finally, artificial intelligence technology can play a role in the identification of sperm and, perhaps, better-quality sperm for use with assisted reproduction.

We aimed to develop an artificial intelligence method to predict the onset of post-operative sepsis earlier. Methods: This pilot study aimed to identify \"physiomarkers\" in continuous minute-by-minute physiologic data streams, such as heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation (SpO2), and blood pressure, to predict the onset of sepsis. The model was derived from a cohort of 5,748 transplant and non-transplant patients across intensive care units (ICUs) over 36 months, with 92 post-liver transplant patients who developed sepsis. Results: Using an alert timestamp generated with the Third International Consensus Definition of Sepsis (Sepsis-3) definition as a reference point, we studied up to 24 h of continuous physiologic data prior to the event, totaling to 8.35 million data points. One hundred fifty-five features were generated using signal processing and statistical methods. Feature selection identified 52 highly ranked features, many of which included blood pressures. An eXtreme Gradient Boost (XGB) classifier was then trained on the ranked features by 5-fold cross validation on all patients (n = 5,748). We identified that the average sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and area under the receiver-operator curve (AUC) of the model after 100 iterations was 0.94 \u00b1 0.02, 0.9 \u00b1 0.02, 0.89 \u00b1 0.01, respectively, and 0.97 \u00b1 0.01 for predicting sepsis 12 h before meeting criteria. Conclusion: The data suggest that machine learning/deep learning can be applied to continuous streaming data in the transplant ICU to monitor patients and possibly predict sepsis.", "Machine learning (ML) is a branch of artificial intelligence that combines computer science, statistics, and decision theory to learn complex patterns from voluminous data. In the last decade, accumulating evidence has shown the utility of ML for prediction, diagnosis, and classification of hypertension and heart failure (HF). In addition, ML-enabled image analysis has potential value in assessing cardiac structure and function in an accurate, scalable, and efficient way. Considering the high burden of hypertension and HF in China and worldwide, ML may help address these challenges from different aspects. Indeed, prior studies have shown that ML can enhance each stage of patient care, from research and development, to daily clinical practice and population health. Through reviewing the published literature, the aims of the current systemic review are to summarize the utilities of ML for the care of those with hypertension and HF.", "Lung and colon cancers are deadly diseases that can develop simultaneously in organs and adversely affect human life in some special cases. Although the frequency of simultaneous occurrence of these two types of cancer is unlikely, there is a high probability of metastasis between the two organs if not diagnosed early. Traditionally, specialists have to go through a lengthy and complicated process to examine histopathological images and diagnose cancer cases; yet, it is now possible to achieve this process faster with the available technological possibilities. In this study, artificial intelligence-supported model and optimization methods were used to realize the classification of lung and colon cancers' histopathological images. The used dataset has five classes of histopathological images consisting of two colon cancer classes and three lung cancer classes. In the proposed approach, the image classes were trained from scratch with the DarkNet-19 model, which is one of the deep learning models. In the feature set extracted from the DarkNet-19 model, selection of the inefficient features was performed by using Equilibrium and Manta Ray Foraging optimization algorithms. Then, the set containing the inefficient features was distinguished from the rest of the set features, creating an efficient feature set (complementary rule insets). The efficient features obtained by the two used optimization algorithms were combined and classified with the Support Vector Machine (SVM) method. The overall accuracy rate obtained in the classification process was 99.69%. Based on the outcomes of this study, it has been observed that using the complementary method together with some optimization methods improved the classification performance of the dataset.", "The COVID-19 pandemic has increased the importance of the deployment of digital detection surveillance systems to support early warning and monitoring of infectious diseases. These opportunities create a \"double-edge sword,\" as the ethical governance of such approaches often lags behind technological achievements.\nThe aim was to investigate ethical issues identified from utilizing artificial intelligence-augmented surveillance or early warning systems to monitor and detect common or novel infectious disease outbreaks.\nIn a number of databases, we searched relevant articles that addressed ethical issues of using artificial intelligence, digital surveillance systems, early warning systems, and/or big data analytics technology for detecting, monitoring, or tracing infectious diseases according to PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines, and further identified and analyzed them with a theoretical framework.\nThis systematic review identified 29 articles presented in 6 major themes clustered under individual, organizational, and societal levels, including awareness of implementing digital surveillance, digital integrity, trust, privacy and confidentiality, civil rights, and governance. While these measures were understandable during a pandemic, the public had concerns about receiving inadequate information; unclear governance frameworks; and lack of privacy protection, data integrity, and autonomy when utilizing infectious disease digital surveillance. The barriers to engagement could widen existing health care disparities or digital divides by underrepresenting vulnerable and at-risk populations, and patients' highly sensitive data, such as their movements and contacts, could be exposed to outside sources, impinging significantly upon basic human and civil rights.\nOur findings inform ethical considerations for service delivery models for medical practitioners and policymakers involved in the use of digital surveillance for infectious disease spread, and provide a basis for a global governance structure.\nPROSPERO CRD42021259180; https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?RecordID=259180.", "National guidelines recommend sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) be offered to patients with > 10% likelihood of sentinel lymph node (SLN) positivity. On the other hand, guidelines do not recommend SLNB for patients with T1a tumors without high-risk features who have < 5% likelihood of a positive SLN. However, the decision to perform SLNB is less certain for patients with higher-risk T1 melanomas in which a positive node is expected 5%-10% of the time. We hypothesized that integrating clinicopathologic features with the 31-gene expression profile (31-GEP) score using advanced artificial intelligence techniques would provide more precise SLN risk prediction.\nAn integrated 31-GEP (i31-GEP) neural network algorithm incorporating clinicopathologic features with the continuous 31-GEP score was developed using a previously reported patient cohort (n = 1,398) and validated using an independent cohort (n = 1,674).\nCompared with other covariates in the i31-GEP, the continuous 31-GEP score had the largest likelihood ratio (G2 = 91.3, P < .001) for predicting SLN positivity. The i31-GEP demonstrated high concordance between predicted and observed SLN positivity rates (linear regression slope = 0.999). The i31-GEP increased the percentage of patients with T1-T4 tumors predicted to have < 5% SLN-positive likelihood from 8.5% to 27.7% with a negative predictive value of 98%. Importantly, for patients with T1 tumors originally classified with a likelihood of SLN positivity of 5%-10%, the i31-GEP reclassified 63% of cases as having < 5% or > 10% likelihood of positive SLN, for a more precise, personalized, and clinically actionable SLN-positive likelihood estimate.\nThese data suggest the i31-GEP could reduce the number of SLNBs performed by identifying patients with likelihood under the 5% threshold for performance of SLNB and improve the yield of positive SLNBs by identifying patients more likely to have a positive SLNB.", "The assessment of cell proliferation is a key morphological feature for diagnosing various pathological lesions and predicting their clinical behaviour. Visual assessment of mitotic figures in routine histological sections remains the gold-standard method to evaluate the proliferative activity and grading of cancer. Despite the apparent simplicity of such a well-established method, visual assessment of mitotic figures in breast cancer (BC) remains a challenging task with low concordance among pathologists which can lead to under or overestimation of tumour grade and hence affects management. Guideline recommendations for counting mitoses in BC have been published to standardise methodology and improve concordance; however, the results remain less satisfactory. Alternative approaches such as the use of the proliferation marker Ki67 have been recommended but these did not show better performance in terms of concordance or prognostic stratification. The advent of whole slide image technology has brought the issue of mitotic counting in BC into the light again with more challenges to develop objective criteria for identifying and scoring mitotic figures in digitalised images. Using reliable and reproducible morphological criteria can provide the highest degree of concordance among pathologists and could even benefit the further application of artificial intelligence (AI) in breast pathology, and this relies mainly on the explicit description of these figures. In this review, we highlight the morphology of mitotic figures and their mimickers, address the current caveats in counting mitoses in breast pathology and describe how to strictly apply the morphological criteria for accurate and reliable histological grade and AI models.", "To evaluate the accuracy of automatic deep learning-based method for fully automatic segmentation of the mandible from CBCTs.\nCBCT-derived mandible fully automatic segmentation.\nForty CBCT scans from healthy patients (20 females and 20 males, mean age 23.37\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.34) were collected, and a manual mandible segmentation was carried out by using Mimics software. Twenty CBCT scans were randomly selected and used for training the artificial intelligence model file. The remaining 20 CBCT segmentation masks were used to test the accuracy of the CNN automatic method by comparing the segmentation volumes of the 3D models obtained with automatic and manual segmentations. The accuracy of the CNN-based method was also assessed by using the DICE Score coefficient (DSC) and by the surface-to-surface matching technique. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and Dahlberg's formula were used respectively to test the intra-observer reliability and method error. Independent Student's t test was used for between-groups volumetric comparison.\nMeasurements were highly correlated with an ICC value of 0.937, while the method error was 0.24 mm3 . A difference of 0.71 (\u00b10.49) cm3 was found between the methodologies, but it was not statistically significant (P\u00a0>\u00a0.05). The matching percentage detected was 90.35% (\u00b11.88) (tolerance 0.5\u00a0mm) and 96.32%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.97% (tolerance 1.0\u00a0mm).

It can be read as a nascent field and as a subset of the wider field of digital ethics, which addresses concerns raised by the development and deployment of new digital technologies, such as AI, big data analytics, and blockchain technologies. The principle aim of this article is to provide a high-level conceptual discussion of the field by way of introducing basic concepts and sketching approaches and central themes in AI ethics. The first part introduces concepts by noting what is being referred to by \"AI\" and \"ethics\", etc.; the second part explores some predecessors to AI ethics, namely engineering ethics, philosophy of technology, and science and technology studies; the third part discusses three current approaches to AI ethics namely, principles, processes, and ethical consciousness; and finally, the fourth part discusses central themes in translating ethics in to engineering practice. We conclude by summarizing and noting the inherent interdisciplinary future directions and debates in AI ethics.", "In pandemic situations like COVID 19, real time monitoring of patient condition and continuous delivery of inspired oxygen can be made possible only through artificial intelligence-based system modeling. Even now manual control of mechanical ventilator parameters is continuing despite the ever-increasing number of patients in critical epidemic conditions. Here a suggestive multi-layer perceptron neural network model is developed to predict the level of inspired oxygen delivered by the mechanical ventilator along with mode and positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) changes for reducing the effort of health care professionals.\nThe artificial neural network model is developed by Python programming using real time data. Parameter identification for model inputs and outputs is done by in corporating consistent real time patient data including periodical arterial blood gas analysis, continuous pulse oximetry readings and mechanical ventilator settings using statistical pairwise analysis using R programming.\nMean square error values and R values of the model are calculated and found to be an average of 0.093 and 0.81 respectively for various data sets. Accuracy loss will be in good fit with validation loss for a comparable number of epochs.\nComparison of the model output is undertaken with physician's prediction using statistical analysis and shows an accuracy error of 4.11 percentages which is permissible for a good predictive system.", "This study examined the relationship between emotional intelligence (EI) and prosocial behavior (PSB) and constructed a model for their interaction by examining the mediating effect of social support (SS) and the moderating effect of self-esteem (SE) in this relationship. A total of 742 college students aged from 18 to 20 in Northeast China (M age =19.42 \u00b1 0.53 years) completed a survey measuring the Emotional Intelligence Scale, Prosocial Tendencies Measurement Scale-Chinese Version, Perceived Social Support Scale, and Self-Esteem Scale. The results showed that: (1) EI positively predicted PSB; (2) SS partially mediated the relationship between EI and PSB; and (3) SE moderated the direct effect of EI on PSB and the relationship between SS and PSB. That is, when the SE of college students was higher, the effect of SS in promoting PSB was enhanced. Therefore, our results suggested that under the influence of both internal and external factors, there is an indirect effect of EI on PSB. This finding may potentially provide a theoretical basis for designing college students' mental health courses and cultivating PSB in college.", "An analysis of secondary students' personality traits, along with a description of their emotional intelligence levels and their anger control, could be decisive when educating students to prevent anti-social behavior in academia. Very few studies on personality, emotional intelligence, and aggressive conduct exist in Spain. Some of the studies that do exist, however, only explore the relationship between emotional intelligence, personality, and prosocial behavior in secondary education students. Likewise, there are few studies focusing on personality and aggression control. In this study, using the Big Five personality models as predictors of aggressiveness in subjects and of emotional intelligence, we sought to contribute to the improvement of the education of students on aggressive behavior in education centers. To do this, we conducted a study using the Big Five Personality Questionnaire (BFQ) for Children and Adults (BFQ-NA), the Trait Meta-Mood Scale (TMMS-24) emotional intelligence test, and the State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory (STAXI) anger management test. Our main objective was to analyze the relationship of the BFQ with the variables of emotional intelligence and aggressiveness. This was achieved using a range of bivariate correlation and multiple regression tests. The results showed the correlation and predictive value of emotional intelligence and aggression in the Big Five model of personality. This study coincides with other research linking Big Five questionnaires with emotional intelligence and aggression.", "Organizations in various industries have widely developed the artificial intelligence (AI) maturity model as a systematic approach. This study aims to review state-of-the-art studies related to AI maturity models systematically. It allows a deeper understanding of the methodological issues relevant to maturity models, especially in terms of the objectives, methods employed to develop and validate the models, and the scope and characteristics of maturity model development. Our analysis reveals that most works concentrate on developing maturity models with or without their empirical validation. It shows that the most significant proportion of models were designed for specific domains and purposes. Maturity model development typically uses a bottom-up design approach, and most of the models have a descriptive characteristic. Besides that, maturity grid and continuous representation with five levels are currently trending in maturity model development. Six out of 13 studies (46%) on AI maturity pertain to assess the technology aspect, even in specific domains. It confirms that organizations still require an improvement in their AI capability and in strengthening AI maturity. This review provides an essential contribution to the evolution of organizations using AI to explain the concepts, approaches, and elements of maturity models.", "Machine learning (ML) has emerged as a branch of artificial intelligence dealing with the analysis of large amounts of data. The applications of ML algorithms have also expanded to health care, including dentistry. Recent advances in this field point to future improvements in diagnostic techniques and the prognosis of various diseases of the teeth and other maxillofacial structures.\nThe aim of this literature review is to describe the basis for ML being applied to different dental sub-fields in recent years, to identify typical algorithms used in the studies, and to summarize the scope and challenges of using these techniques in dental clinical practice.\nThe proficiency of emerging technologies that have begun to show encouraging results in the diagnosis and prognosis of oral diseases can improve the precision in the selection of treatment for patients.

Predictors of psychiatric outcomes following pediatric TBI at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months postinjury have previously been reported. In this study, repeat psychiatric assessments were completed at 24 years postinjury with the same cohort, now adults aged 29-39 years, with the outcome measure being presence of a psychiatric disorder not present before the TBI (\"novel psychiatric disorder\").\nFifty participants with pediatric TBI were initially enrolled, and the long-term outcome analyses focused on data from 45 individuals. Novel psychiatric disorder was present in 24 out of 45 (53%) participants. Presence of a current novel psychiatric disorder was independently predicted by the presence of a preinjury lifetime psychiatric disorder and by severity of TBI.\nLong-term psychiatric outcome (mean=23.92 years [SD=2.17]) in children and adolescents hospitalized for TBI can be predicted at the point of the initial hospitalization encounter by the presence of a preinjury psychiatric disorder and by greater injury severity.", "Electrical energy is a vital part of modern life, and expectations for grid resilience to allow a continuous and reliable energy supply has tremendously increased even during adverse events (e.g. Ukraine cyberattack, Hurricane Maria). The global pandemic COVID-19 has raised the electric energy reliability risk due to potential workforce disruptions, supply chain interruptions, and increased possible cybersecurity threats. Additionally, the pandemic introduces a significant degree of uncertainty to the grid operation in the presence of other challenges including aging power grids, high proliferation of distributed generation, market mechanism, and active distribution network. This situation increases the need for measures for the resiliency of power grids to mitigate the impact of the pandemic as well as simultaneous extreme events including cyberattacks and adverse weather events. Solutions to manage such an adverse scenario will be multi-fold: (a) emergency planning and organisational support, (b) following safety protocol, (c) utilising enhanced automation and sensing for situational awareness, and (d) integration of advanced technologies and data points for ML-driven enhanced decision support. Enhanced digitalisation and automation resulted in better network visibility at various levels, including generation, transmission, and distribution. These data or information can be employed to take advantage of advanced machine learning techniques for automation and increased power grid resilience. In this paper, the resilience of power grids in the face of pandemics is explored and various machine learning tools that can be helpful to augment human operators are discused by: (a) reviewing the impact of COVID-19 on power grid operations and actions taken by operators/organisations to minimise the impact of COVID-19, and (b) presenting recently developed tools and concepts of machine learning and artificial intelligence that can be applied to increase the resiliency of power systems in normal and extreme scenarios such as the COVID-19\u00a0pandemic.", "This paper provides a roadmap that explores the question of how to imbue learning agents with the ability to understand and generate contextually relevant natural language in service of achieving a goal. We hypothesize that two key components in creating such agents are interactivity and environment grounding, shown to be vital parts of language learning in humans, and posit that interactive narratives should be the environments of choice for such training these agents. These games are simulations in which an agent interacts with the world through natural language-perceiving, acting upon, and talking to the world using textual descriptions, commands, and dialogue-and, as such, exist at the intersection of natural language processing, storytelling, and sequential decision making. We discuss the unique challenges a text games' puzzle-like structure combined with natural language state-and-action spaces provides: knowledge representation, common-sense reasoning, and exploration. Beyond the challenges described so far, progress in the realm of interactive narratives can be applied in adjacent problem domains. These applications provide interesting challenges of their own as well as extensions to those discussed so far. We describe three of them in detail: (1) evaluating artificial intelligence (AI) systems' common-sense understanding by automatically creating interactive narratives; (2) adapting abstract text-based policies to include other modalities, such as vision; and (3) enabling multi-agent and human-AI collaboration in shared, situated worlds.", "Citrobacter rodentium, a natural mouse pathogen which colonises the colon of immuno-competent mice, provides a robust model for interrogating host-pathogen-microbiota interactions in vivo. This model has been key to providing new insights into local host responses to enteric infection, including changes in intestinal epithelial cell immunometabolism and mucosal immunity. C. rodentium injects 31 bacterial effectors into epithelial cells via a type III secretion system (T3SS). Recently, these effectors were shown to be able to form multiple intracellular subnetworks which can withstand significant contractions whilst maintaining virulence. Here we highlight recent advances in understanding gut mucosal responses to infection and effector biology, as well as potential uses for artificial intelligence (AI) in understanding infectious disease and speculate on the role of T3SS effector networks in host adaption.", "Skin cancer is currently the most common type of cancer among Caucasians. The increase in life expectancy, along with new diagnostic tools and treatments for skin cancer, has resulted in unprecedented changes in patient care and has generated a great burden on healthcare systems. Early detection of skin tumors is expected to reduce this burden. Artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms that support skin cancer diagnoses have been shown to perform at least as well as dermatologists' diagnoses. Recognizing the need for clinically and economically efficient means of diagnosing skin cancers at early stages in the primary care attention, we developed an efficient computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system to be used by primary care physicians (PCP). Additionally, we developed a smartphone application with a protocol for data acquisition (i.e., photographs, demographic data and short clinical histories) and AI algorithms for clinical and dermoscopic image classification. For each lesion analyzed, a report is generated, showing the image of the suspected lesion and its respective Heat Map; the predicted probability of the suspected lesion being melanoma or malignant; the probable diagnosis based on that probability; and a suggestion on how the lesion should be managed. The accuracy of the dermoscopy model for melanoma was 89.3%, and for the clinical model, 84.7% with 0.91 and 0.89 sensitivity and 0.89 and 0.83 specificity, respectively. Both models achieved an area under the curve (AUC) above 0.9. Our CAD system can screen skin cancers to guide lesion management by PCPs, especially in the contexts where the access to the dermatologist can be difficult or time consuming. Its use can enable risk stratification of lesions and/or patients and dramatically improve timely access to specialist care for those requiring urgent attention.", "Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic lung disease most commonly seen in preterm infants of low birthweight who required postnatal respiratory support. Although overall incidence rates have not changed, recent advancements in medical care have resulted in lower mortality rates, and those affected are beginning to live longer. As a result, the long-term repercussions of BPD are becoming more apparent. Whereas BPD has been thought of as a disease of just the lungs, resulting in abnormalities such as increased susceptibility to pulmonary infections, impaired exercise tolerance, and pulmonary hypertension, the enduring complications of BPD have been found to extend much further. This includes an increased risk for cerebral palsy and developmental delays, lower intelligence quotient (IQ) scores, impaired executive functioning, behavioral challenges, delays in expressive and receptive language development, and an increased risk of growth failure. In addition, the deficits of BPD have been found to influence much more than just physical health; BPD survivors have been noted to have higher rates of health care use, starting with the initial hospitalization and continuing with therapy and specialist follow-up, as well as impairments in quality of life, both physical and psychological, that continue into adulthood. The long-term consequences of BPD may best be addressed through future research, including better understanding of the pathophysiologic mechanisms leading to BPD, further comparisons between newborns with BPD and those without, and long-term assessment and management of BPD patients as adults.", "Social media enables medical professionals and authorities to share, disseminate, monitor, and manage health-related information digitally through online communities such as Twitter and Facebook. Simultaneously, artificial intelligence (AI) powered social media offers digital capabilities for organizations to select, screen, detect and predict problems with possible solutions through digital health data. Both the\u00a0patients and healthcare professionals have benefited from such improvements. However, arising ethical concerns related to the use of AI raised by stakeholders need scrutiny which could help organizations obtain trust, minimize privacy invasion, and eventually facilitate the responsible success of AI-enabled social media operations. This paper examines the impact of responsible AI on businesses using insights from analysis of 25 in-depth interviews of health care professionals. The exploratory analysis conducted revealed that abiding by\u00a0the responsible AI principles can allow healthcare businesses to better take advantage of the improved effectiveness of their social media marketing initiatives with their users. The\u00a0analysis is further used to offer research propositions and conclusions, and the contributions and limitations of the study have been discussed.", "Artificial intelligence and machine learning are poised to disrupt PET imaging from bench to clinic. In this perspective, the authors offer insights into how the technology could be applied to improve the radiosynthesis of new radiopharmaceuticals for PET imaging, including identification of an optimal labeling approach as well as strategies for radiolabeling reaction optimization.", "Little is known about associations of psychological and mental well-being with cognitive and socioemotional factors in low and middle-income countries, particularly among vulnerable populations born in adverse environments that may restrict developmental potential. This study aimed to examine the cognitive and socioemotional correlates of psychological well-being and mental health in a cohort of Guatemalan adults born in contexts of poverty and malnutrition.\nFrom Dec 2017 to Apr 2019, data were collected from 704 women and 564 men ages\u00a040-57 years living in four rural villages in eastern Guatemala and Guatemala City. We measured latent domains of psychological well-being, spirituality and religion, emotional support, and executive function using Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA). Under a Structural Equation Modeling framework, we examined intercorrelations among latent domains and observed measures of intelligence and mental health.\nCFA supported the construct validity of factor structures in this population. Correlations of psychological well-being with spirituality and religion were moderate in women (r\u2009=\u20090.68, p\u2009<\u20090.001) and men (r\u2009=\u20090.70, p\u2009<\u20090.001). Executive function was weakly correlated with psychological well-being in men (r\u2009=\u20090.23, p\u2009<\u20090.001) and showed no association in women. Correlations of psychological well-being with emotional support and IQ were weak in women (r\u2009=\u20090.34, and r\u2009=\u20090.15, respectively; p\u2009<\u20090.001 for both) and men (r\u2009=\u20090.35, and r\u2009=\u20090.25, respectively; p\u2009<\u20090.001 for both). Mental health and IQ were weakly correlated in men (r\u2009=\u20090.09, p\u2009<\u20090.05) and showed no association in women. Mental health showed weak correlations with emotional support (r\u2009=\u20090.18, p\u2009<\u20090.001 in women; r\u2009=\u20090.09, p\u2009<\u20090.05 in men), psychological well-being (r\u2009=\u20090.32 and r\u2009=\u20090.35, in women and men respectively; p\u2009<\u20090.001 for both) and showed no association with executive function in both sexes.\nOf all examined factors, spirituality and religion made the greatest contribution to psychological well-being. These findings support the notion that in populations experiencing difficult circumstances, religion can perhaps make a greater contribution to well-being and aid coping. More research is needed to examine mediators of this association.", "Alcohol use, presents unique challenges for HIV-1 treatment in adolescents with perinatally acquired infection. The effects of alcohol on host-virus interaction in the brain and the immune system remains understudied in this population. Adolescents with perinatally acquired HIV infection (PHIV) well established on ART, from the Cape Town Adolescent Antiretroviral Cohort who self-reported alcohol use (PHIV\u00a0+\u00a0alcohol) (n\u00a0=\u00a026) were compared to age matched 26 PHIV (PHIV-alcohol) and 26 healthy controls (HC) who reported no use of alcohol. Participants completed clinical investigations including highly-sensitive CRP (hs-CRP), a comprehensive neurocognitive test battery and mental health measures. In addition, we investigated the relationship between alcohol use in PHIV and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and structural brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to determine fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), grey and white matter volumes and cortical thickness. PHIV (mean age 12,5 years; mean age of ART initiation 3.15 years) reported an occasional weekend drinking pattern of alcohol use. hs-CRP was significantly different between groups, with PHIV\u00a0+\u00a0alcohol higher than PHIV-alcohol and HC. General intelligence, attention, working memory, processing speed and executive function were more impaired in the PHIV\u00a0+\u00a0alcohol than PHIV alone, with HC having the highest scores. In addition, self-concept was significantly lower in PHIV\u00a0+\u00a0alcohol. The Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) Externalizing behaviour, internalising behaviour and CBCL Total problems were significantly higher in PHIV\u00a0+\u00a0alcohol. FA of the superior corona radiata, superior fronto-occipital fasciculus and corpus callosum was significantly lower in PHIV\u00a0+\u00a0alcohol compared to PHIV-alcohol and MD of the corona radiata was significantly increased in PHIV\u00a0+\u00a0alcohol. The cortical thickness of the lateral orbitofrontal, middle frontal and precentral gyri were significantly lower in PHIV\u00a0+\u00a0alcohol compared to PHIV-alcohol and HC. In conclusion PHIV associated impairments in systemic inflammation, cognitive function, mental health and changes in brain structure may be exacerbated by alcohol use, even if only occasional use. However, the study is cross-sectional, which is not able to distinguish between cause and effect.", "Artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques are breaking into biomedical research and health care, which importantly includes cancer research and oncology, where the potential applications are vast. These include detection and diagnosis of cancer, subtype classification, optimization of cancer treatment and identification of new therapeutic targets in drug discovery. While big data used to train machine learning models may already exist, leveraging this opportunity to realize the full promise of artificial intelligence in both the cancer research space and the clinical space will first require significant obstacles to be surmounted. In this Viewpoint article, we asked four experts for their opinions on how we can begin to implement artificial intelligence while ensuring standards are maintained so as transform cancer diagnosis and the prognosis and treatment of patients with cancer and to drive biological discovery.", "Distal radius (wrist) fractures are the second most common fracture admitted to hospital. The anatomical pattern of these types of injuries is diverse, with variation in clinical management, guidelines for management remain inconclusive, and the uptake of findings from clinical trials into routine practice limited. Robust predictive modelling, which considers both the characteristics of the fracture and patient, provides the best opportunity to reduce variation in care and improve patient outcomes. This type of data is housed in unstructured data sources with no particular format or schema. The \"Predicting fracture outcomes from clinical Registry data using Artificial Intelligence (AI) Supplemented models for Evidence-informed treatment (PRAISE)\" study aims to use AI methods on unstructured data to describe the fracture characteristics and test if using this information improves identification of key fracture characteristics and prediction of patient-reported outcome measures and clinical outcomes following wrist fractures compared to prediction models based on standard registry data.\nAdult (16+ years) patients presenting to the emergency department, treated in a short stay unit, or admitted to hospital for >24h for management of a wrist fracture in four Victorian hospitals will be included in this study. The study will use routine registry data from the Victorian Orthopaedic Trauma Outcomes Registry (VOTOR), and electronic medical record (EMR) information (e.g. X-rays, surgical reports, radiology reports, images). A multimodal deep learning fracture reasoning system (DLFRS) will be developed that reasons on EMR information. Machine learning prediction models will test the performance with/without output from the DLFRS.\nThe PRAISE study will establish the use of AI techniques to provide enhanced information about fracture characteristics in people with wrist fractures. Prediction models using AI derived characteristics are expected to provide better prediction of clinical and patient-reported outcomes following distal radius fracture.", "Existing campaign-based healthcare delivery programs used for immunization often fall short of established health coverage targets due to a lack of accurate estimates for population size and location. A microplan, an integrated set of detailed planning components, can be used to identify this information to support programs such as equitable vaccination efforts. Here, we presents a series of steps necessary to create an artificial intelligence-based framework for automated microplanning, and our pilot implementation of this analysis tool across 29 countries of the Americas. Further, we describe our processes for generating a conceptual framework, creating customized catchment areas, and estimating up-to-date populations to support microplanning for health campaigns. Through our application of the present framework, we found that 68 million individuals across the 29 countries are within 5\u00a0km of a health facility. The number of health facilities analyzed ranged from 2 in Peru to 789 in Argentina, while the total population within 5\u00a0km ranged from 1,233 in Peru to 15,304,439 in Mexico. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of using this methodological framework to support the development of customized microplans for health campaigns using open-source data in multiple countries. The pandemic is demanding an improved capacity to generate successful, efficient immunization campaigns; we believe that the steps described here can increase the automation of microplans in low resource settings.", "Smart skin is highly desired to be ultrasensitive and self-powered as the medium of artificial intelligence. Here, an ultrasensitive self-powered mechanoluminescence smart skin (SPMSS) inspired by the luminescence mechanism of cephalopod skin and the ultrasensitive response of spider-slit-organ is developed. Benefitting from the unique strain-dependent microcrack structure design based on Ti3 C2 Tx (MXene)/carbon nanotube synergistic interaction, SPMSS possesses excellent strain sensing performances including ultralow detection limit (0.001% strain), ultrahigh sensitivity (gauge factor, GF = 3.92 \u00d7 107 ), ultrafast response time (5\u00a0ms), and superior durability and stability (>45\u2009000 cycles). Synchronously, SPMSS exhibits tunable and highly sensitive mechanoluminescence (ML) features under stretching. A relationship between ML features, strain sensing performances, and the deformation has been established successfully. Importantly, the SPMSS demonstrates excellent properties as triboelectric nanogenerator (4 \u00d7 4 cm2 ), including ultrahigh triboelectric output (open-circuit voltage VOC \u00a0= 540\u00a0V, short-circuit current ISC \u00a0= 42 \u00b5A, short-circuit charge QSC \u00a0= 317 nC) and power density (7.42 W m-2 ), endowing the smart skin with reliable power source supply and self-powered sensing ability. This bioinspired smart skin exhibits multifunctional applications in health monitoring, visual sensing, and self-powered sensing, showing great potential in artificial intelligence.", "The color variation of hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained tissues has presented a challenge for applications of artificial intelligence (AI) in digital pathology. Many color normalization algorithms have been developed in recent years in order to reduce the color variation between H&E images. However, previous efforts in benchmarking these algorithms have produced conflicting results and none have sufficiently assessed the efficacy of the various color normalization methods for improving diagnostic performance of AI systems. In this study, we systematically investigated eight color normalization algorithms for AI-based classification of H&E-stained histopathology slides, in the context of using images both from one center and from multiple centers. Our results show that color normalization does not consistently improve classification performance when both training and testing data are from a single center. However, using four multi-center datasets of two cancer types (ovarian and pleural) and objective functions, we show that color normalization can significantly improve the classification accuracy of images from external datasets (ovarian cancer: 0.25 AUC increase, p\u2009=\u20091.6\u00a0e-05; pleural cancer: 0.21 AUC increase, p\u2009=\u20091.4\u00a0e-10). Furthermore, we introduce a novel augmentation strategy by mixing color-normalized images using three easily accessible algorithms that consistently improves the diagnosis of test images from external centers, even when the individual normalization methods had varied results. We anticipate our study to be a starting point for reliable use of color normalization to improve AI-based, digital pathology-empowered diagnosis of cancers sourced from multiple centers. \u00a9 2021 The Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.", "Non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) is the most frequent keratinocyte-origin skin tumor. It is confirmed that dermoscopy of NMSC confers a diagnostic advantage as compared to visual face-to-face assessment. COVID-19 restrictions diagnostics by telemedicine photos, which are analogous to visual inspection, displaced part of in-person visits. This study evaluated by a dual convolutional neural network (CNN) performance metrics in dermoscopic (DI) versus smartphone-captured images (SI) and tested if artificial intelligence narrows the proclaimed gap in diagnostic accuracy.\nA CNN that receives a raw image and predicts malignancy, overlaid by a second independent CNN which processes a sonification (image-to-sound mapping) of the original image, were combined into a unified malignancy classifier. All images were histopathology-verified in a comparison between NMSC and benign skin lesions excised as suspected NMSCs. Study criteria outcomes were sensitivity and specificity for the unified output.\nImages acquired by DI (n\u2009=\u2009132 NMSC, n\u2009=\u200933 benign) were compared to SI (n\u2009=\u2009170 NMSC, n\u2009=\u200928 benign). DI and SI analysis metrics resulted in an area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operator characteristic curve of 0.911 and 0.821, respectively. Accuracy was increased by DI (0.88; CI 81.9-92.4) as compared to SI (0.75; CI 68.1-80.6, p\u2009<\u20090.005). Sensitivity of DI was higher than SI (95.3%, CI 90.4-98.3 vs 75.3%, CI 68.1-81.6, p\u2009<\u20090.001), but not specificity (p\u2009=\u2009NS).\nTelemedicine use of smartphone images might result in a substantial decrease in diagnostic performance as compared to dermoscopy, which needs to be considered by both healthcare providers and patients.", "Current preimplantation genetic testing (PGT) technologies enable embryo genotyping across the whole genome. This has led to the development of polygenic risk scoring of human embryos (PGT-P). Recent implementation of PGT-P, including screening for intelligence, has been extensively covered by media\u00a0reports, raising major controversy. Considering the increasing demand for assisted reproduction, we evaluated how information about PGT-P is communicated in press media and explored the diversity of ethical themes present in the public debate.\nLexisNexis Academic database and Google News were searched to identify articles about polygenic embryo screening. This led to 535 news articles. 59 original articles met the inclusion criteria. Inductive content analysis was used to analyse these articles.\n8.8% of articles gave embryo polygenic scoring a positive portrayal, while 36.8% expressed a negative attitude. 54.4% were neutral, mostly highlighting limited practical value of the technology in in vitro fertilization settings. We identified five main ethical themes that are also present in academic literature and the broader debate on reproductive technologies: a slippery slope towards designer babies, well-being of the child and parents, impact on society, deliberate choice and societal readiness.\nImplementation of embryo polygenic profiling engenders a need for specific recommendations. Current media analysis discloses important ethical themes to consider when creating future guidelines for PGT-P.", "Fiber-based nanogenerators have great potential applications in wearable electronics such as portable nanodevices, e-skin, and artificial intelligence system. Here, we report a kind of fiber-based electret nanogenerator (FENG) with a semisupported core-shell structure. Owing to its unique structure, the open-circuit voltage and short-circuit current of the FENG reach 40 V and 0.6 \u03bcA, respectively, under a short working distance (\u223c25 \u03bcm). No obvious degradation of the output performance under a long-time continuous work (>16 h) and different humidity environments (20-95%) is observed, which demonstrates the FENG's good reliability and stability. Many universal materials, such as cotton rope, conductive sewing thread, and polyvinyl chloride tube, have been successfully used to fabricate FENG. Meanwhile, the FENG-based wearable fabric has been successfully developed to effectively harvest mechanical energy of human motion. The FENG is highly effective, reliable, and stable, promoting the development of fiber-based nanogenerators and their applications in self-powered wearable electronics.", "To evaluate the cognitive function in dialysis patients over 60\u2009years old and identify the contributing factors.\nA group of elderly dialysis patients in the Department of Nephrology, Pan'an People's Hospital between March 2015 and June 2018 were chosen as the subjects for this study. Patients were divided into two groups, those with cognitive impairment and those with normal cognitive function. Results of their Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores, Controlled Oral Word Association Test (COWAT), Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale Digit Span subtest (WDMS), and Stanford Diagnostic Math Test (SDMT) were reviewed and analyzed.\nAmong the 110 elderly dialysis patients, 75 patients (68.18%) showed different levels of damage to their cognitive function. Their assessment scores on MoCA (total), MoCA subtests: visuospatial/executive, naming, attention, language, delayed recall, abstraction and orientation, COWAT (total), COWAT1, COWAT2, COWAT3, WMDS-Backward, and SDMT are significantly lower than patients with normal cognitive abilities (p\u00a0<\u20090.05). Further analysis showed that the highest percentage (72.00%) of patients had impairment with visuospatial/executive function; and, of the 75 cognitive impaired patients, 37.33% showed cognitive damage in two MoCA subtests simultaneously. Patients with and without cognitive impairment showed a significant (p\u00a0<\u20090.05) difference on factors including age, education level, employment status, financial situation, dialysis vintage, serum albumin, and hemoglobin.\nElderly patients on dialysis have a higher risk of becoming cognitive impaired. The cognitive impairment in elderly dialysis patients was significantly associated with age, dialysis vintage, and levels of serum albumin and hemoglobin.", "Lung cancer was the second most commonly diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer death in 2020. Although artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted diagnostic technologies have shown promise and has been used in clinical practice in recent years, no products related to AI-assisted CT diagnostic technologies for the classification of pulmonary nodules have been approved by the National Medical Products Administration in China. The objective of this article was to systematically review the diagnostic performance of AI-assisted CT diagnostic technology for the classification of pulmonary nodules as benign or malignant and to analyze physicians' perceptions of this technology in China.\nAll relevant studies from 6 literature databases were searched and screened according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Data were extracted and the study quality was assessed by two reviewers. The study heterogeneity and publication bias were estimated. A questionnaire survey on the perceptions of physicians was conducted in 9 public tertiary hospitals in China. A meta-analysis, meta-regression and univariate logistic model were used in the systematic review and to explore the association of physicians' perceptions with their rate of support for the clinical application of the technology.\nTwenty-seven studies with 5,727 pulmonary nodules were finally included in the meta-analysis. We found that the quality of the included studies was generally acceptable and that the pooled sensitivity and specificity of AI-assisted CT diagnostic technology for the classification of pulmonary nodules as benign or malignant were 0.90 and 0.89, respectively. The pooled diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) was 70.33. The majority of the surveyed physicians in China perceived \"reduced workload for radiologists\" and \"improved diagnostic efficiency\" as the important benefits of this technology. In addition, diagnostic accuracy (including misdiagnosis) and practical experience were significantly associated with whether physicians supported its clinical application.\nIn the context of lung cancer diagnosis, AI-assisted CT diagnostic technology for the classification of pulmonary nodules as benign or malignant has good diagnostic performance, but its specificity needs to be improved.", "Pre-visit planning (PVP) is believed to improve effectiveness, efficiency, and experience of care, yet numerous implementation barriers exist. There are opportunities for technology-enabled and artificial intelligence (AI) support to augment existing human-driven PVP processes-from appointment reminders and pre-visit questionnaires to pre-visit order sets and care gap closures. This study aimed to explore the current state of PVP, barriers to implementation, evidence of impact, and potential use of non-AI and AI tools to support PVP.\nWe used an environmental scan approach involving: (1) literature review; (2) key informant interviews with PVP experts in ambulatory care; and (3) a search of the public domain for technology-enabled and AI solutions that support PVP. We then synthesized the findings using a qualitative matrix analysis.\nWe found 26 unique PVP implementations in the literature and conducted 16 key informant interviews. Demonstration of impact is typically limited to process outcomes, with improved patient outcomes remaining elusive. Our key informants reported that many PVP barriers are human effort-related and see potential for non-AI and AI technologies to support certain aspects of PVP. We identified 8 examples of commercially available technology-enabled tools that support PVP, some with AI capabilities; however, few of these have been independently evaluated.\nAs health systems transition toward value-based payment models in a world where the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has shifted patient care into the virtual space, PVP activities-driven by humans and supported by technology-may become more important and powerful and should be rigorously evaluated.", "Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the ability of the neonatal neurobehavioral characteristics to act as an indicator for later neurodevelopment and neurocognitive performance. Methods: Sixty-six infants born extremely preterm (<28 gestational weeks) were followed until 6.5 years. Neurobehavior at term age was assessed by the behavior subscale of the Hammersmith Neonatal Neurological Examination (HNNE) using dichotomic rating, optimal, and non-optimal. The Griffiths Mental Developmental Scales (GMDS) at 2 years, and the Wechsler Intelligence Scales at 6.5 years, and a Neuropsychological Assessment at 6.5 years were used to assess neurodevelopment and neurocognitive performance including social cognition skills. Results: An optimal auditory orientation at term age was associated with better developmental quotients (DQ) in Personal-Social, and Hearing-Language GMDS subscale at 2 years (p < 0.05). An optimal visual alertness was associated with better Total (p < 0.01), Locomotor (p < 0.001), and Eye-Hand Coordination (p < 0.01) DQs at 2 years, and with sensorimotor function (p < 0.001) and social perception (p < 0.01) tests at 6.5 years. Conclusion: The neurobehavioral characteristics of newborns might serve as a precursor of social cognition skills and the HNNE behavior subscale offers a tool to identify infants at risk for later deficits in neurodevelopment and social cognition.", "Micro/nano topographic structures have shown great utility in many biomedical areas including cell therapies, tissue engineering, and implantable devices. Computer-assisted informatics methods hold great promise for the design of topographic structures with targeted properties for a specific medical application. To benefit from these methods, researchers and engineers require a highly reusable \"one structural parameter - one set of cell responses\" database. However, existing confounding factors in topographic cell culture devices seriously impede the acquisition of this kind of data. Through carefully dissecting the confounding factors and their possible reasons for emergence, we developed corresponding guideline requirements for topographic cell culture device development to remove or control the influence of such factors. Based on these requirements, we then suggested potential strategies to meet them. In this work, we also experimentally demonstrated a topographic cell culture device with controlled confounding factors based on these guideline requirements and corresponding strategies. A \"guideline for the development of topographic cell culture devices\" was summarized to instruct researchers to develop topographic cell culture devices with the confounding factors removed or well controlled. This guideline aims to promote the establishment of a highly reusable \"one structural parameter - one set of cell responses\" database that could facilitate the application of informatics methods, such as artificial intelligence, in the rational design of future biotopographic structures with high efficacy.", "Evidence-based teaching practices (EBPs) foster college science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) students' engagement and performance, yet our knowledge of what contributes to the effectiveness of these practices is less established. We propose a framework that links four social-cognitive variables-students' trust in their instructors, growth mindset, buy-in to instructional practices, and course engagement-to long-standing desired student outcomes of academic performance and intent to persist in science. This framework was tested in classrooms identified as having a high level of EBP implementation with a multi-institutional sample of 2102 undergraduates taught by 14 faculty members. Results indicate that the buy-in framework is a valid representation of college students' learning experiences within EBP contexts overall as well as across underrepresented student groups. In comparison to students' level of growth mindset, students' trust in their instructors was more than twice as predictive of buy-in to how the course was being taught, suggesting that students' views of their instructors are more associated with thriving in a high-EBP course environment than their views of intelligence. This study contributes to the dialogue on transforming undergraduate STEM education by providing a validated student buy-in framework as a lens to understand how EBPs enhance student outcomes.", "With the rapid development, different information relating to sports may now be recorded forms of useful big data through wearable and sensing technology. Big data technology has become a pressing challenge to tackle in the present basketball training, which improves the effect of baseball analysis. In this study, we propose the Spark framework based on in-memory computing for big data processing. First, we use a new swarm intelligence optimization cuckoo search algorithm because the algorithm has fewer parameters, powerful global search ability, and support of fast convergence. Second, we apply the traditional K-clustering algorithm to improve the final output using clustering means in Spark distributed environment. Last, we examine the aspects that could lead to high-pressure game circumstances to study professional athletes' defensive performance. Both recruiters and trainers may use our technique to better understand essential player's qualities and eventually, to assess and improve a team's performance. The experimental findings reveal that the suggested approach outperforms previous methods in terms of clustering performance and practical utility. It has the greatest influence on the shooting training impact when moving, yielding complimentary outcomes in the training effect.", "Rolandic epilepsy (RE) is one of the most common forms of epilepsy syndromes in children. The condition is usually accompanied with either unilateral or bilateral centrotemporal epileptic discharge. Despite the term \"benign\", many studies have reported that children with benign epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (BECTS) display a range of pervasive cognitive difficulties. In addition, existing research suggests that unilateral and bilateral centrotemporal spikes may affect cognition through different mechanisms. Consequently, the present study aimed to investigate cognitive impairment and the resting-state network topology of children with benign epilepsy with unilateral centrotemporal spikes (U-BECTS) and with bilateral centrotemporal spikes (B-BECTS).\nThis study recruited 14 children with U-BECTS and 14 with B-BECTS. Thereafter, cognition was assessed in 28 children with BECTS and 14 healthy controls, using the fourth edition of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale (WISC-IV). Additionally, the functional network of the brain was constructed through magnetoencephalography (MEG) to record the resting-state brain magnetic signals of the brain and by computing virtual sensor waveforms at the source level. Moreover, graph theory (GT) analysis was used to assess the properties of the brain network.\nChildren in the B-BECTS group had an earlier onset of epilepsy compared to those in the U-BECTS category. In addition, both the B-BECTS and U-BECTS groups had lower Full Scale Intelligence Quotient (FSIQ), Verbal Comprehension Index (VCI), and Working Memory Index (WMI) scores, compared to the healthy controls although only children in the B-BECTS category had lower Perceptual Reasoning Index (PRI) scores. The results also showed that both BECTS groups had increased frontal cortex connectivity in specific frequency bands. Notably, children with B-BECTS showed a more disorderly and randomized network in the 1-4-Hz and 80-250-Hz frequency bands. Moreover, GT analysis showed that children with B-BECTS had lower clustering coefficient and characteristic path length in the 80-250-Hz frequency bands and higher connection strength in the 4-8-Hz frequency bands. On the other hand, the U-BECTS group had a higher clustering coefficient in the 8-12-Hz frequency bands, compared to the healthy controls. Correlation analysis revealed that there were negative correlations between network parameters, clinical characteristics, and neuropsychological data in the U-BECTS category.\nThe findings revealed that children with BECTS display a diffuse early cognitive deficit. In addition, resting-state suboptimal network topology may be the mechanism of cognitive impairment in children with BECTS. The study also showed that and children with B-BECTS may be at a higher risk of cognitive impairment.", "The visual perception system is the most important system for human learning since it receives over 80% of the learning information from the outside world. With the exponential growth of artificial intelligence technology, there is a pressing need for high-energy and area-efficiency visual perception systems capable of processing efficiently the received natural information. Currently, memristors with their elaborate dynamics, excellent scalability, and information (e.g., visual, pressure, sound, etc.) perception ability exhibit tremendous potential for the application of visual perception. Here, we propose a fully memristor-based artificial visual perception nervous system (AVPNS) which consists of a quantum-dot-based photoelectric memristor and a nanosheet-based threshold-switching (TS) memristor. We use a photoelectric and a TS memristor to implement the synapse and leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neuron functions, respectively. With the proposed AVPNS we successfully demonstrate the biological image perception, integration and fire, as well as the biosensitization process. Furthermore, the self-regulation process of a speed meeting control system in driverless automobiles can be accurately and conceptually emulated by this system. Our work shows that the functions of the biological visual nervous system may be systematically emulated by a memristor-based hardware system, thus expanding the spectrum of memristor applications in artificial intelligence.", "It has often been shown that tests as intentionally hindered and difficult learning tasks increase long-term learning compared to easier tasks. Previous work additionally indicated that higher intelligence might serve as a prerequisite for such beneficial effects of tests. Nevertheless, despite their long-term learning effects, tests were also found to be evaluated as more negative and to lead to more stress and anxiety compared to easier control tasks. Stress and anxiety, in turn, often yield detrimental effects on learning outcomes. Hence, we hypothesized that tests increase later learning outcomes but simultaneously also lead to more stress perceptions. Such increased stress was, in turn, hypothesized to reduce later learning outcomes (thus, stress might serve as a mediator of the beneficial effects of tests on learning). All these assumed effects should further be moderated by intelligence, insofar as that higher intelligence should increase beneficial effects of tests on learning, should decrease stress perceptions caused by tests, and should reduce detrimental effects of stress on learning outcomes. Higher intelligence was also assumed to be generally associated with higher learning. We conducted a laboratory study (N=89) to test these hypotheses: Participants underwent an intelligence screening, then worked on either a test or a re-reading control task, and reported their immediate stress perceptions. Later learning outcomes were assessed after 1week. The results supported all assumed main effects but none of the assumed interactions. Thus, participants using tests had higher long-term learning outcomes compared to participants using re-reading tasks. However, participants using tests also perceived more immediate stress compared to participants that only re-read the materials. These stress perceptions in turn diminished the beneficial effects of tests. Stress was also generally related to lower learning, whereas higher intelligence was linked to higher learning and also to lower stress. Hence, our findings again support the often assumed benefits of tests-even when simultaneously considering learners' intelligence and and when considering the by tests caused stress perceptions. Notably, controlling for stress further increases these long-term learning benefits. We then discuss some limitations and boundaries of our work as well as ideas for future studies.", "The Domain Name Service (DNS) is a central point in the functioning of the internet. Just as organizations use domain names to enable the access to their computational services, malicious actors make use of domain names to point to the services under their control. Distinguishing between non-malicious and malicious domain names is extremely important, as it allows to grant or block the access to external services, maximizing the security of the organization and users. Nowadays there are many DNS firewall solutions. Most of these are based on known malicious domain lists that are being constantly updated. However, in this way, it is only possible to block known malicious communications, leaving out many others that can be malicious but are not known. Adopting machine learning to classify domains contributes to the detection of domains that are not yet on the block list. The dataset described in this manuscript is meant for supervised machine learning-based analysis of malicious and non-malicious domain names. The dataset was created from scratch, using publicly DNS logs of both malicious and non-malicious domain names. Using the domain name as input, 34 features were obtained. Features like the domain name entropy, number of strange characters and domain name length were obtained directly from the domain name. Other features like, domain name creation date, Internet Protocol (IP), open ports, geolocation were obtained from data enrichment processes (e.g. Open Source Intelligence (OSINT)). The class was determined considering the data source (malicious DNS log files and non-malicious DNS log files). The dataset consists of data from approximately 90000 domain names and it is balanced between 50% non-malicious and 50% of malicious domain names.", "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary malignant liver tumor in China. Preoperative diagnosis of HCC is challenging because of atypical imaging manifestations and the diversity of focal liver lesions. Artificial intelligence (AI), such as machine learning (ML) and deep learning, has recently gained attention for its capability to reveal quantitative information on images. Currently, AI is used throughout the entire radiomics process and plays a critical role in multiple fields of medicine. This review summarizes the applications of AI in various aspects of preoperative imaging of HCC, including segmentation, differential diagnosis, prediction of histopathology, early detection of recurrence after curative treatment, and evaluation of treatment response. We also review the limitations of previous studies and discuss future directions for diagnostic imaging of HCC.", "The COVID 19 has brought unprecedented changes in the way we communicate. There is a greater accent on Virtual communication. This paper aims to establish a relationship between Emotional intelligence and the effectiveness of Virtual communication on Decision making. This empirical study is based on a sample drawn from 296 working professionals at five different levels of organizational hierarchy. A standardized questionnaire (\u0251\u2009=\u20090.824) was used to collect the responses of Emotional intelligence, Virtual communication, and Decision-making effectiveness.\u00a0Hierarchical regression using\u00a0PROCESS Macro model 1\u00a0was used to identify the moderating effect of Emotional intelligence on Virtual communication and Decision making effectiveness.\u00a0Since the p-value (p\u2009\u2264\u2009.007) is found significant, Emotional intelligence acts as a moderator that affects the strength of the relationship between Virtual communication effectiveness and Decision making. Validation of Task Technology fit theory is the theoretical implication of the study. Manipulation of individual dimensions in the model can reduce the dependence on technology for task completion with enhanced performance effectiveness. The findings are relevant to educators, consultants, and any professional who need to adapt Virtual communication platforms on an ongoing basis. Since work-life balance is projected as a constraint in this study, policymakers can consider policy amendments to reduce the stress caused due to Virtual\u00a0communication which intrudes into their personal space. This empirical study is the first of its kind to benchmark the organizational practice of Emotional intelligence training to enhance Virtual communication and Decision making effectiveness during unprecedented times of pandemic.", "Clinical artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms have the potential to improve clinical care, but fair, generalizable algorithms depend on the clinical data on which they are trained and tested.\nTo assess whether data sets used for training diagnostic AI algorithms addressing skin disease are adequately described and to identify potential sources of bias in these data sets.\nIn this scoping review, PubMed was used to search for peer-reviewed research articles published between January 1, 2015, and November 1, 2020, with the following paired search terms: deep learning and dermatology, artificial intelligence and dermatology, deep learning and dermatologist, and artificial intelligence and dermatologist.\nStudies that developed or tested an existing deep learning algorithm for triage, diagnosis, or monitoring using clinical or dermoscopic images of skin disease were selected, and the articles were independently reviewed by 2 investigators to verify that they met selection criteria.\nData set audit criteria were determined by consensus of all authors after reviewing existing literature to highlight data set transparency and sources of bias.\nA total of 70 unique studies were included. Among these studies, 1\u202f065\u202f291 images were used to develop or test AI algorithms, of which only 257\u202f372 (24.2%) were publicly available. Only 14 studies (20.0%) included descriptions of patient ethnicity or race in at least 1 data set used. Only 7 studies (10.0%) included any information about skin tone in at least 1 data set used. Thirty-six of the 56 studies developing new AI algorithms for cutaneous malignant neoplasms (64.3%) met the gold standard criteria for disease labeling. Public data sets were cited more often than private data sets, suggesting that public data sets contribute more to new development and benchmarks.\nThis scoping review identified 3 issues in data sets that are used to develop and test clinical AI algorithms for skin disease that should be addressed before clinical translation: (1) sparsity of data set characterization and lack of transparency, (2) nonstandard and unverified disease labels, and (3) inability to fully assess patient diversity used for algorithm development and testing.", "Aortic regurgitation (AR) is a common heart disease, with a relatively high prevalence of 4.9% in the Framingham Heart Study. Because the prevalence increases with advancing age, an upward shift in the age distribution may increase the burden of AR. To provide an effective screening method for AR, we developed a deep learning-based artificial intelligence algorithm for the diagnosis of significant AR using electrocardiography (ECG).\nOur dataset comprised 29,859 paired data of ECG and echocardiography, including 412 AR cases, from January 2015 to December 2019. This dataset was divided into training, validation, and test datasets. We developed a multi-input neural network model, which comprised a two-dimensional convolutional neural network (2D-CNN) using raw ECG data and a fully connected deep neural network (FC-DNN) using ECG features, and compared its performance with the performances of a 2D-CNN model and other machine learning models. In addition, we used gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) to identify which parts of ECG waveforms had the most effect on algorithm decision making.\nThe area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the multi-input model (0.802; 95% CI, 0.762-0.837) was significantly greater than that of the 2D-CNN model alone (0.734; 95% CI, 0.679-0.783; p<0.001) and those of other machine learning models. Grad-CAM demonstrated that the multi-input model tended to focus on the QRS complex in leads I and aVL when detecting AR.\nThe multi-input deep learning model using 12-lead ECG data could detect significant AR with modest predictive value.", "Significance: Accurately predicting wound healing trajectories is difficult for wound care clinicians due to the complex and dynamic processes involved in wound healing. Wound care teams capture images of wounds during clinical visits generating big datasets over time. Developing novel artificial intelligence (AI) systems can help clinicians diagnose, assess the effectiveness of therapy, and predict healing outcomes. Recent Advances: Rapid developments in computer processing have enabled the development of AI-based systems that can improve the diagnosis and effectiveness of therapy in various clinical specializations. In the past decade, we have witnessed AI revolutionizing all types of medical imaging like X-ray, ultrasound, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, etc., but AI-based systems remain to be developed clinically and computationally for high-quality wound care that can result in better patient outcomes. Critical Issues: In the current standard of care, collecting wound images on every clinical visit, interpreting and archiving the data are cumbersome and time consuming. Commercial platforms are developed to capture images, perform wound measurements, and provide clinicians with a workflow for diagnosis, but AI-based systems are still in their infancy. This systematic review summarizes the breadth and depth of the most recent and relevant work in intelligent image-based data analysis and system developments for wound assessment. Future Directions: With increasing availabilities of massive data (wound images, wound-specific electronic health records, etc.) as well as powerful computing resources, AI-based digital platforms will play a significant role in delivering data-driven care to people suffering from debilitating chronic wounds.", "Modern artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) methods are now capable of completing tasks with performance characteristics that are comparable to those of expert human operators. As a result, many areas throughout healthcare are incorporating these technologies, including in vitro diagnostics and, more broadly, laboratory medicine. However, there are limited literature reviews of the landscape, likely future, and challenges of the application of AI/ML in laboratory medicine.\nIn this review, we begin with a brief introduction to AI and its subfield of ML. The ensuing sections describe ML systems that are currently in clinical laboratory practice or are being proposed for such use in recent literature, ML systems that use laboratory data outside the clinical laboratory, challenges to the adoption of ML, and future opportunities for ML in laboratory medicine.\nAI and ML have and will continue to influence the practice and scope of laboratory medicine dramatically. This has been made possible by advancements in modern computing and the widespread digitization of health information. These technologies are being rapidly developed and described, but in comparison, their implementation thus far has been modest. To spur the implementation of reliable and sophisticated ML-based technologies, we need to establish best practices further and improve our information system and communication infrastructure. The participation of the clinical laboratory community is essential to ensure that laboratory data are sufficiently available and incorporated conscientiously into robust, safe, and clinically effective ML-supported clinical diagnostics.", "Artificial intelligence-based computer-aided polyp detection (CADe) systems are intended to address the issue of missed polyps during colonoscopy. The effect of CADe during screening and surveillance colonoscopy has not previously been studied in a United States (U.S.) population.\nWe conducted a prospective, multi-center, single-blind randomized tandem colonoscopy study to evaluate a deep-learning based CADe system (EndoScreener, Shanghai Wision AI, China). Patients were enrolled across 4 U.S. academic medical centers from 2019 through 2020. Patients presenting for colorectal cancer screening or surveillance were randomized to CADe colonoscopy first or high-definition white light (HDWL) colonoscopy first, followed immediately by the other procedure in tandem fashion by the same endoscopist. The primary outcome was adenoma miss rate (AMR), and secondary outcomes included sessile serrated lesion (SSL) miss rate and adenomas per colonoscopy (APC).\nA total of 232 patients entered the study, with 116 patients randomized to undergo CADe colonoscopy first and 116 patients randomized to undergo HDWL colonoscopy first. After the exclusion of 9 patients, the study cohort included 223 patients. AMR was lower in the CADe-first group compared with the HDWL-first group (20.12% [34/169] vs 31.25% [45/144]; odds ratio [OR], 1.8048; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.0780-3.0217; P\u00a0= .0247). SSL miss rate was lower in the CADe-first group (7.14% [1/14]) vs the HDWL-first group (42.11% [8/19]; P\u00a0= .0482). First-pass APC was higher in the CADe-first group (1.19 [standard deviation (SD), 2.03] vs 0.90 [SD, 1.55]; P\u00a0= .0323). First-pass ADR was 50.44% in the CADe-first group and 43.64 % in the HDWL-first group (P\u00a0= .3091).\nIn this U.S. multicenter tandem colonoscopy randomized controlled trial, we demonstrate a decrease in AMR and SSL miss rate and an increase in first-pass APC with the use of a CADe-system when compared with HDWL colonoscopy alone.", "Computed tomography (CT) is most commonly used to produce three-dimensional (3D) models for evaluating bone and joint morphology in clinical practice. However, 3D models created from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data can be equally effective for comprehensive and accurate assessment of osseous and soft tissue structure morphology and pathology. The quality of 3D MRI models has steadily increased over time, with growing potential to replace 3D CT models in various musculoskeletal (MSK) applications. In practice, a single MRI examination for two-dimensional and 3D assessments can increase the value of MRI and simplify the pre- and postoperative imaging work-up. Multiple studies have shown excellent performance of 3D MRI models in shoulder injuries, in the hip in the setting of femoroacetabular impingement, and in the knee for the creation of bone surface models. Therefore, the utility of 3D MRI postprocessed models is expected to continue to rise and broaden in applications. Computer-based and artificial intelligence-assisted postprocessing techniques have tremendous potential to improve the efficiency of 3D model creation, opening many research avenues to validate the applicability of 3D MRI and establish 3D-specific quantitative assessment criteria. We provide a practice-focused overview of 3D MRI acquisition strategies, postprocessing techniques for 3D model creation, MSK applications of 3D MRI models, and an illustration of cases from our daily clinical practice.", "The future private gastroenterology practice will be a large multidisciplinary practice including a clinic, AEC, pathology services, infusion services, anesthesia services, pharmacy services, and imaging centers. Delivery of gastrointestinal (GI) services will be a team-based clinic with AEC access and improved quality of care. Competing technologies will drive practices to promote the value of colonoscopy as the best screening test for colon cancer. Artificial intelligence (AI) may significantly alter our approach to clinic and endoscopic services. The creative and intellectual capital of practice leaders will continue to define the private GI practice of the future.", "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused a serious global health crisis. It has been proven that the deep learning method has great potential to assist doctors in diagnosing COVID-19 by automatically segmenting the lesions in computed tomography (CT) slices. However, there are still several challenges restricting the application of these methods, including high variation in lesion characteristics and low contrast between lesion areas and healthy tissues. Moreover, the lack of high-quality labeled samples and large number of patients lead to the urgency to develop a high accuracy model, which performs well not only under supervision but also with semi-supervised methods.\nWe propose a content-aware lung infection segmentation deep residual network (content-aware residual UNet (CARes-UNet)) to segment the lesion areas of COVID-19 from the chest CT slices. In our CARes-UNet, the residual connection was used in the convolutional block, which alleviated the degradation problem during the training. Then, the content-aware upsampling modules were introduced to improve the performance of the model while reducing the computation cost. Moreover, to achieve faster convergence, an advanced optimizer named Ranger was utilized to update the model's parameters during training. Finally, we employed a semi-supervised segmentation framework to deal with the problem of lacking pixel-level labeled data.\nWe evaluated our approach using three public datasets with multiple metrics and compared its performance to several models. Our method outperforms other models in multiple indicators, for instance in terms of Dice coefficient on COVID-SemiSeg Dataset, CARes-UNet got the score 0.731, and semi-CARes-UNet further boosted it to 0.776. More ablation studies were done and validated the effectiveness of each key component of our proposed model.\nCompared with the existing neural network methods applied to the COVID-19 lesion segmentation tasks, our CARes-UNet can gain more accurate segmentation results, and semi-CARes-UNet can further improve it using semi-supervised learning methods while presenting a possible way to solve the problem of lack of high-quality annotated samples. Our CARes-UNet and semi-CARes-UNet can be used in artificial intelligence-empowered computer-aided diagnosis system to improve diagnostic accuracy in this ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.", "The clinical complications of congenital hypothyroidism such as brain disorders are very subtle and are not recognizable in infancy period. They are recognizable when it is too late for treatment or prevention. General screening of newborns is effective in diagnosing congenital hypothyroidism and initiating initial treatment. The aim of this study is to compare the physical and mental growth pattern of children with congenital hypothyroidism with healthy ones.\nThis case-control study was performed on 34 patients and 68 healthy children who were matched in terms of inclusion and exclusion criteria. Children development screening test (ASQ), children development assessment test (Bayley), preschool Wechsler intelligence scale (WPPSI) and age and steps questionnaire of emotional social development (ASQ-SE) were completed by trained questioners. Data were analyzed using STATA software.\nThe results indicated that there was no significant difference between the mean of verbal (P\u2009=\u20090.77), non-verbal (P\u2009=\u20090.81) and general (P\u2009=\u20090.66) IQ in permanent and transient patients and healthy individuals. Also, there was no significant difference between the mean of different ranges of ASQ test (including communication, delicate and large movements, problem solving and social) at 12\u00a0months and 42\u00a0months (P\u2009<\u20090.05). According to Bayley test, there was no significant difference between the cases (permanent and transient) and controls in the cognitive (P\u2009=\u20090.42) and expressive (P\u2009=\u20090.38) categories. The difference was significant in the perceptual (P\u2009=\u20090.011), large (P\u2009=\u20090.03) and delicate (P\u2009=\u20090.04) movements categories.\nThis study emphasized on the high effectiveness of neonate hypothyroidism screening program, so that the difference between 3.5\u00a0years old children with and without this disease has decreased significantly. Early diagnosis of the patients, while creating beneficial effects for patients and increasing quality of life, cause reduction in the long-term costs of the health system.", "Mortality from colorectal cancer is reduced through screening and early detection; moreover, removal of neoplastic lesions can reduce cancer incidence. While understanding of the risk factors, pathogenesis, and precursor lesions of colorectal cancer has advanced, the cause of the recent increase in cancer among young adults is largely unknown. Multiple invasive, semi- and non-invasive screening modalities have emerged over the past decade. The current emphasis on quality of colonoscopy has improved the effectiveness of screening and prevention, and the role of new technologies in detection of neoplasia, such as artificial intelligence, is rapidly emerging. The overall screening rates in the US, however, are suboptimal, and few interventions have been shown to increase screening uptake. This review provides an overview of colorectal cancer, the current status of screening efforts, and the tools available to reduce mortality from colorectal cancer.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques for image-based segmentation have garnered much attention in recent years. Convolutional neural networks have shown impressive results and potential toward fully automated segmentation in medical imaging, and particularly PET imaging. To cope with the limited access to annotated data needed in supervised AI methods, given tedious and prone-to-error manual delineations, semi-supervised and unsupervised AI techniques have also been explored for segmentation of tumors or normal organs in single- and bimodality scans. This work reviews existing AI techniques for segmentation tasks and the evaluation criteria for translational AI-based segmentation efforts toward routine adoption in clinical workflows.", "Findings on the associations between anxiety and cognitive decline are mixed and often confounded.\nWe studied whether anxiety symptoms were associated with the risk of cognitive decline after adequate adjustment of confounding factors.\nOur study consists of 2,551 community-dwelling older adults recruited between the ages of 60-64 years and followed up for 12 years in the PATH Through Life cohort study. Anxiety symptoms were measured using the Goldberg Anxiety Scale (GAS; range 0-9). General cognitive function, episodic memory, working memory, verbal intelligence, processing speed, and psychomotor speed were measured. Multilevel analyses were carried out to investigate the association between anxiety symptoms and cognitive decline over 12 years, taking into account confounding variables.\nWe did not find a significant association between baseline anxiety symptoms and cognitive decline over 12 years. Although some associations between anxiety symptoms with psychomotor speed (\u03b2=\u200a-0.04, 99% CI: -0.08, 0.00) and processing speed (\u03b2=\u200a-0.27, 99% CI: -0.48, -0.07) were found, these were attenuated after adjusting for depression. We also did not find an association between cumulative anxiety and decline in cognitive performance.\nIn this sample of cognitively healthy men and women aged 60 years and above, anxiety symptoms were not associated with the risk of cognitive decline. Long follow-up study time, appropriate selection of confounding factors, and estimating the effect of cumulative anxiety are important to establish the association between anxiety and cognitive symptoms.", "Brain health is becoming more important to the average person as the number of people with cognitive impairments, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), is rising significantly. The current Food and Drug Administration-approved pharmacotherapeutics for dementia neither cure nor halt cognitive decline; they just delay the worsening cognitive impairment. This narrative review summarizes the effects of nutrients and phytonutrients on cognitive function.\nA comprehensive literature search of PubMed was performed to find clinical trials in humans that assessed the effects of nutrients and phytonutrients on cognitive function published in English between 2000 and 2021. Six independent reviewers evaluated the articles for inclusion in this review.\nNinety-six articles were summarized in this narrative review. In total 21 categories of nutrients and phytonutrients were included, i.e., \u03b1-lipoic acid, Bacopa monnieri, B vitamins, cholinergic precursors, vitamin D, vitamin E, Ginkgo biloba, ginseng, lion's mane mushroom, N-acetyl cysteine, omega-3 fatty acids, aloe polysaccharides, Rhodiola rosea, rosemary, saffron, tart cherries, turmeric, wild yam, Withania somnifera, xanthines, and zinc. Particular noteworthy effects on cognition included memory, recollection, attention, intelligence, vocabulary, recognition, response inhibition, arousal, performance enhancement, planning, creative thinking, reaction time, vigilance, task switching, orientation to time, place, and person, reading, writing, comprehension, accuracy, learning, information processing speed, executive function, mental flexibility, daily functioning, decrease in mental fatigue, and freedom from distractibility. Some nutrients and phytonutrients also improved mood and contentedness and reduced anxiety and the need for caregiving. These effects are not completely consistent or ubiquitous across all patient populations or health statuses. Adverse effects were minimal or nonexistent.\nDue to the growing population of people with cognitive impairment and the lack of effective pharmacotherapeutics, it is prudent for those afflicted or their caregivers to find alternative treatments. Our narrative review shows that many of these nutrients and phytonutrients may be promising for treating some aspects of cognitive impairment, especially for people afflicted with AD.\nAs demonstrated in a number of clinical trials, healthy adults and patients with various health challenges (e.g., AD, mild cognitive impairment, multiple sclerosis, and Parkinson's disease) exhibiting a wide range of severity in cognitive defects would be best served to consider multiple nutrients and phytonutrients to improve aspects of their cognitive function.", "The incidence of infertility is continuously increasing nearly all over the world in recent years, and novel methods for accurate assessment are of great need. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has gradually become an effective supplementary method for the assessment of female reproductive function. It has been used in clinical follicular monitoring, optimum timing for transplantation, and prediction of pregnancy outcome. Some literatures summarize the use of AI in this field, but few of them focus on the assessment of female reproductive function by AI-aided ultrasound. In this review, we mainly discussed the applicability, feasibility, and value of clinical application of AI in ultrasound to monitor follicles, assess endometrial receptivity, and predict the pregnancy outcome of in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer (IVF-ET). The limitations, challenges, and future trends of ultrasound combined with AI in providing efficient and individualized evaluation of female reproductive function had also been mentioned.", "At its core, radiation therapy (RT) requires balancing therapeutic effects against risk of adverse events in cancer survivors. The radiation oncologist weighs numerous disease and patient-level factors when considering the expected risk-benefit ratio of combined treatment modalities. As part of this, RT plan optimization software is used to find a clinically acceptable RT plan delivering a prescribed dose to the target volume while respecting pre-defined radiation dose-volume constraints for selected organs at risk. The obvious limitation to the current approach is that it is virtually impossible to ensure the selected treatment plan could not be bettered by an alternative plan providing improved disease control and/or reduced risk of adverse events in this individual. Outcome-based optimization refers to a strategy where all planning objectives are defined by modeled estimates of a specific outcome's probability. Noting that various adverse events and disease control are generally incommensurable, leads to the concept of a Pareto-optimal plan: a plan where no single objective can be improved without degrading one or more of the remaining objectives. Further benefits of outcome-based multiobjective optimization are that quantitative estimates of risks and benefit are obtained as are the effects of choosing a different trade-off between competing objectives. Furthermore, patient-level risk factors and combined treatment modalities may be integrated directly into plan optimization. Here, we present this approach in the clinical setting of multimodality therapy for malignant lymphoma, a malignancy with marked heterogeneity in biology, target localization, and patient characteristics. We discuss future research priorities including the potential of artificial intelligence.", "Ongoing COVID-19 pandemic poses many challenges to the research of artificial intelligence. Epidemics are important in network science for modeling disease spread over networks of contacts between individuals. To prevent disease spread, it is desirable to introduce prioritized isolation of the individuals contacting many and unspecified others, or connecting different groups. Finding such influential individuals in social networks, and simulating the speed and extent of the disease spread are what we need for combating COVID-19. This article focuses on the following topics, and discusses some of the traditional and emerging research attempts: (1) topics related to epidemics in network science, such as epidemic modeling, influence maximization and temporal networks, (2) recent research of network science for COVID-19 and (3) datasets and resources for COVID-19 research.", "The COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated efficient and accurate triaging of patients for more effective allocation of resources and treatment.\nThe objectives are to investigate parameters and risk stratification tools that can be applied to predict mortality within 90 days of hospital admission in patients with COVID-19.\nA literature search of original studies assessing systems and parameters predicting mortality of patients with COVID-19 was conducted using MEDLINE and EMBASE.\n589 titles were screened, and 76 studies were found investigating the prognostic ability of 16 existing scoring systems (area under the receiving operator curve (AUROC) range: 0.550-0.966), 38 newly developed COVID-19-specific prognostic systems (AUROC range: 0.6400-0.9940), 15 artificial intelligence (AI) models (AUROC range: 0.840-0.955) and 16 studies on novel blood parameters and imaging.\nCurrent scoring systems generally underestimate mortality, with the highest AUROC values found for APACHE II and the lowest for SMART-COP. Systems featuring heavier weighting on respiratory parameters were more predictive than those assessing other systems. Cardiac biomarkers and CT chest scans were the most commonly studied novel parameters and were independently associated with mortality, suggesting potential for implementation into model development. All types of AI modelling systems showed high abilities to predict mortality, although none had notably higher AUROC values than COVID-19-specific prediction models. All models were found to have bias, including lack of prospective studies, small sample sizes, single-centre data collection and lack of external validation.\nThe single parameters established within this review would be useful to look at in future prognostic models in terms of the predictive capacity their combined effect may harness.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) is in full development and its implementation in medicine has led to an improvement in clinical and surgical practice. One of its multiple applications is surgical training, with the creation of programs that allow avoiding complications and risks for the patient. The aim of this article is to analyze the advantages of AI applied to surgical training in urology.\nA literary research is carried out to identify articles published in English regarding AI applied to medicine, especially in surgery and the acquisition of surgical skills.\nSurgical training has evolved over time thanks to AI. A model for surgical learning where skills are acquired in a progressive way while avoiding complications to the patient, has been created. The use of simulators allows a progressive learning, providing trainees with procedures that increase in number and complexity. On the other hand, AI is used in imaging tests for surgical or treatment planning.\nCurrently, the use of AI in daily clinical practice has led to progress in medicine, specifically in surgical training.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) is defined as a set of algorithms and intelligence to try to imitate human intelligence. Machine learning is one of them, and deep learning is one of those machine learning techniques. The application of AI in healthcare systems including hospitals and clinics has many possible advantages and future prospects. Applications of AI in cardiovascular medicine are machine learning techniques for diagnostic procedures including imaging modalities and biomarkers and predictive analytics for personalized therapies and improved outcomes. In cardiovascular medicine, AI-based systems have found new applications in risk prediction for cardiovascular diseases, in cardiovascular imaging, in predicting outcomes after revascularization procedures, and in newer drug targets. AI such as machine learning has partially resolved and provided possible solutions to unmet requirements in interventional cardiology. Predicting economically vital endpoints, predictive models with a wide range of health factors including comorbidities, socioeconomic factors, and angiographic factors comprising of the size of stents, the volume of contrast agent which was infused during angiography, stent malposition, and so on have been possible owing to machine learning and AI. Nowadays, machine learning techniques might possibly help in the identification of patients at risk, with higher morbidity and mortality following acute coronary syndrome (ACS). AI through machine learning has shown several potential benefits in patients with ACS. From diagnosis to treatment effects to predicting adverse events and mortality in patients with ACS, machine learning should find an essential place in clinical medicine and in interventional cardiology for the treatment and management of patients with ACS. This paper is a review of the literature which will focus on the application of AI in ACS.", "Prediction of the severity of COVID-19 at its onset is important for providing adequate and timely management to reduce mortality.\nTo study the prognostic value of damage parameters and cytokines as predictors of severity of COVID-19 using an extensive immunologic profiling and unbiased artificial intelligence methods.\nSixty hospitalized COVID-19 patients (30 moderate and 30 severe) and 17 healthy controls were included in the study. The damage indicators high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), extensive biochemical analyses, a panel of 47 cytokines and chemokines were analyzed at weeks 1, 2 and 7 along with clinical complaints and CT scans of the lungs. Unbiased artificial intelligence (AI) methods (logistic regression and Support Vector Machine and Random Forest algorithms) were applied to investigate the contribution of each parameter to prediction of the severity of the disease.\nOn admission, the severely ill patients had significantly higher levels of LDH, IL-6, monokine induced by gamma interferon (MIG), D-dimer, fibrinogen, glucose than the patients with moderate disease. The levels of macrophage derived cytokine (MDC) were lower in severely ill patients. Based on artificial intelligence analysis, eight parameters (creatinine, glucose, monocyte number, fibrinogen, MDC, MIG, C-reactive protein (CRP) and IL-6 have been identified that could predict with an accuracy of 83-87% whether the patient will develop severe disease.\nThis study identifies the prognostic factors and provides a methodology for making prediction for COVID-19 patients based on widely accepted biomarkers that can be measured in most conventional clinical laboratories worldwide.", "The objective of this study was to establish diagnostic technology to automatically grade the severity of diabetic retinopathy (DR) according to the ischemic index and leakage index with ultra-widefield fluorescein angiography (UWFA) and the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) 7-standard field (7-SF).\nThis is a cross-sectional study. UWFA samples from 280 diabetic patients and 119 normal patients were used to train and test an artificial intelligence model to differentiate PDR and NPDR based on the ischemic index and leakage index with UWFA. A panel of retinal specialists determined the ground truth for our data set before experimentation. A confusion matrix as a metric was used to measure the precision of our algorithm, and a simple linear regression function was implemented to explore the discrimination of indexes on the DR grades. In addition, the model was tested with simulated 7-SF.\nThe model classification of DR in the original UWFA images achieved 88.50% accuracy and 73.68% accuracy in the simulated 7-SF images. A simple linear regression function demonstrated that there is a significant relationship between the ischemic index and leakage index and the severity of DR. These two thresholds were set to classify the grade of DR, which achieved 76.8% accuracy.\nThe optimization of the cycle generative adversarial network (CycleGAN) and convolutional neural network (CNN) model classifier achieved DR grading based on the ischemic index and leakage index with UWFA and simulated 7-SF and provided accurate inference results. The classification accuracy with UWFA is slightly higher than that of simulated 7-SF.", "The close relationship of medicine with technology and the particular interest in this symbiosis in recent years has led to the development of several computed artificial intelligence (AI) systems aimed at various areas of medicine. A number of studies have demonstrated that those systems allow accurate diagnoses with histological precision, thus facilitating decision-making by clinicians in real time. In the field of gastroenterology, AI has been applied in the diagnosis of pathologies of the entire digestive tract and their attached glands, and are increasingly accepted for the detection of colorectal polyps and confirming their histological classification. Studies have shown high accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity in relation to expert endoscopists, and mainly in relation to those with less experience. Other applications that are increasingly studied and with very promising results are the investigation of dysplasia in patients with Barrett's esophagus and the endoscopic and histological assessment of colon inflammation in patients with ulcerative colitis. In some cases AI is thus better than or at least equal to human abilities. However, additional studies are needed to reinforce the existing data, and mainly to determine the applicability of this technology in other indications. This review summarizes the state of the art of AI in gastroenterological pathology.", "The controlled, prospective intervention study without randomization with a non-inferiority study design investigates the effectiveness of psychoanalytic treatments without medication in comparison to behavioral therapy treatments with and without medication in children aged 6 to 11 years with a diagnosis of ADHD and/or conduct disorder. 73 children (58 boys and 15 girls) were included in the study. Diagnostics before treatment, at end of treatment and at follow-up after 38 months included a standardized clinical interview (DISYPS-KJ), questionnaires for parents, teachers and children (DISYPS-KJ, CBCL, TRF, CPRS, CTRS, ILK), intelligence test and behavioral observation of the child. Primary outcome criterion was disorder-specific symptom reduction at end of treatment and follow-up. Both treatment groups showed significant symptom reductions at end of treatment and at follow-up. There were no significant differences between treatment groups. Parent and teacher ratings showed significant improvements in both groups at end of treatment and at follow-up on the ADHD index, oppositional behavior, and hyperactivity/impulsivity scales, as well as on the externalizing and internalizing behavior problems scales. Quality of life improved for children in both treatment groups.\nZusammenfassung Die kontrollierte, prospektive Interventionsstudie ohne Randomisierung mit einem \u201enon-inferiority\u201c Studiendesign untersucht die Wirksamkeit psychoanalytischer Behandlungen ohne Medikation im Vergleich zu verhaltenstherapeutischen Behandlungen mit und ohne Medikation bei Kindern im Alter zwischen 6 und 11 Jahren mit der Diagnose ADHS und/oder St\u00f6rung des Sozialverhaltens. 73 Kinder (58 Jungen und 15 M\u00e4dchen) wurden in die Studie eingeschlossen. Die Forschungsdiagnostik zur Pr\u00e4-, Postmessung und zum Follow-up nach durchschnittlich 38 Monate umfasste ein standardisiertes klinisches Interview (DISYPS-KJ), Frageb\u00f6gen f\u00fcr Eltern, Lehrer/innen und Kinder (DISYPS-KJ, CBCL, TRF, CPRS, CTRS, ILK), Intelligenztest und die Verhaltensbeobachtung des Kindes. Als prim\u00e4res Zielkriterium wurde die st\u00f6rungsspezifische Symptomreduktion zur Postmessung und zum Follow-up definiert. Beide Behandlungsgruppen zeigten nach dem Ende der Behandlung und zum Follow-up signifikante Symptomreduktionen. Es gab keinen signifikanten Unterschied zwischen den Behandlungsgruppen. In den Eltern- und in den Lehrer/innenurteilen ergaben sich zu beiden Messzeitpunkten in beiden Gruppen \u00e4hnlich signifikante Verbesserungen \u00fcber die Zeit auf den Skalen des ADHS-Indexes, des oppositionellen Verhaltens und der Hyperaktivit\u00e4t/Impulsivit\u00e4t, in den Skalen der externalisierenden und internalisierenden Verhaltensprobleme und in der Lebensqualit\u00e4t des Kindes.", "Margin reflex distance 1 (MRD1), margin reflex distance 2 (MRD2), and levator muscle function (LF) are crucial metrics for ptosis evaluation and management. However, manual measurements of MRD1, MRD2, and LF are time-consuming, subjective, and prone to human error. Smartphone-based artificial intelligence (AI) image processing is a potential solution to overcome these limitations.\nWe propose the first smartphone-based AI-assisted image processing algorithm for MRD1, MRD2, and LF measurements.\nThis observational study included 822 eyes of 411 volunteers aged over 18 years from August 1, 2020, to April 30, 2021. Six orbital photographs (bilateral primary gaze, up-gaze, and down-gaze) were taken using a smartphone (iPhone 11 Pro Max). The gold-standard measurements and normalized eye photographs were obtained from these orbital photographs and compiled using AI-assisted software to create MRD1, MRD2, and LF models.\nThe Pearson correlation coefficients between the gold-standard measurements and the predicted values obtained with the MRD1 and MRD2 models were excellent (r=0.91 and 0.88, respectively) and that obtained with the LF model was good (r=0.73). The intraclass correlation coefficient demonstrated excellent agreement between the gold-standard measurements and the values predicted by the MRD1 and MRD2 models (0.90 and 0.84, respectively), and substantial agreement with the LF model (0.69). The mean absolute errors were 0.35 mm, 0.37 mm, and 1.06 mm for the MRD1, MRD2, and LF models, respectively. The 95% limits of agreement were -0.94 to 0.94 mm for the MRD1 model, -0.92 to 1.03 mm for the MRD2 model, and -0.63 to 2.53 mm for the LF model.\nWe developed the first smartphone-based AI-assisted image processing algorithm for eyelid measurements. MRD1, MRD2, and LF measures can be taken in a quick, objective, and convenient manner. Furthermore, by using a smartphone, the examiner can check these measurements anywhere and at any time, which facilitates data collection.", "The well-being of special education teachers is key to their mental health and also influences the development of their students. This study aimed to investigate the psychological mechanism of the well-being of special education teachers in China, where they are maximum in number. We explored the role of emotional intelligence (EI) and work engagement on the well-being of teachers. A total of 496 Chinese special education teachers participated in the current study. Results suggested that (1) the EI and work engagement were positively associated with the well-being of special education teachers; and that (2) work engagement played a mediating role on EI and well-being of special education teachers. To promote the well-being of special education teachers, suggestions for policymakers and schools are discussed.", "This study aimed to explore the intelligence quotient (IQ) profile among children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and identify the most important subscales that predict the IQ. The analysis of an intellectual profile with age and gender differentials and the identification of a battery of subscales of intelligence are important for clinical management of ASD among children and for facilitating placement for remedial and educational services.\nData were collected through an exploratory study of 100 children aged between three and 13 years, who were referred to the department of child health and development in Sultan Qaboos University Hospital, a tertiary hospital, in Oman between June 2016 and June 2019.\nAmong the 100 participants of this study, 79% were male, resulting in a male-female ratio of 4:1. The mean of full-scale IQ was found to be 68.6 \u00b1 18.1. Furthermore, the mean of nonverbal IQ (73.5 \u00b1 17.5) was significantly higher than that of verbal IQ (65.5 \u00b1 17.6). Finally, more than half (61%) of the children were observed to have had mild to moderate impairment in their IQ levels.\nAge and gender showed no significant association with IQ level. The regression analysis identified nonverbal fluid reasoning, nonverbal visual-spatial processing, nonverbal working memory and verbal knowledge as the significant predictors of total IQ. The crucial dimensions of verbal and nonverbal IQ identified in this study can be used to evaluate complicated cases.", "Value-based reimbursement arrangements tie financial incentives to achieving quality measures to ensure savings are not from withholding care. For patients and their families, the delivery of high-quality care is simply the expectation. Defining and measuring pediatric quality, however, is not standardized which has led to a large proliferation of metrics across multiple stakeholders. The majority of these measures are process rather than outcomes metrics often chosen for the ease at which the data can be obtained. In order to drive greater value, outcomes measures should be preferentially selected. However, measuring outcomes in children presents multiple unique challenges. Compared to adults, children are generally healthier, their outcomes may take more time to manifest, and their clinical variability is greater. Another challenge is the amount of healthcare data being generated by providers, provider networks, payors, government agencies, and many others. This should help in understanding pediatric quality outcomes, but the massive volume of data requires new analytic tools. Artificial intelligence techniques such as machine learning offer faster, more precise, and larger scale evaluation of quality outcomes. Its implementation necessitates identifying expertise in the way of data scientists as well as additional infrastructure components to evaluate data governance, security, regulatory compliance, and ethics. Despite these prerequisites, much progress is being made in outcome insights that drive value benefiting children and families.", "The aims of this work were to create a robust automatic software tool for measurement of the levator hiatal area on transperineal ultrasound (TPUS) volumes and to measure the potential reduction in variability and time taken for analysis in a clinical setting. The proposed tool automatically detects the C-plane (i.e., the plane of minimal hiatal dimensions) from a 3-D TPUS volume and subsequently uses the extracted plane to automatically segment the levator hiatus, using a convolutional neural network. The automatic pipeline was tested using 73 representative TPUS volumes. Reference hiatal outlines were obtained manually by two experts and compared with the pipeline's automated outlines. The Hausdorff distance, area, a clinical quality score, C-plane angle and C-plane Euclidean distance were used to evaluate C-plane detection and quantify levator hiatus segmentation accuracy. A visual Turing test was created to compare the performance of the software with that of the expert, based on the visual assessment of C-plane and hiatal segmentation quality. The overall time taken to extract the hiatal area with both measurement methods (i.e., manual and automatic) was measured. Each metric was calculated both for computer-observer differences and for inter-and intra-observer differences. The automatic method gave results similar to those of the expert when determining the hiatal outline from a TPUS volume. Indeed, the hiatal area measured by the algorithm and by an expert were within the intra-observer variability. Similarly, the method identified the C-plane with an accuracy of 5.76 \u00b1 5.06\u00b0 and 6.46 \u00b1 5.18 mm in comparison to the inter-observer variability of 9.39 \u00b1 6.21\u00b0 and 8.48 \u00b1 6.62 mm. The visual Turing test suggested that the automatic method identified the C-plane position within the TPUS volume visually as well as the expert. The average time taken to identify the C-plane and segment the hiatal area manually was 2 min and 35 \u00b1 17 s, compared with 35 \u00b1 4 s for the automatic result. This study presents a method for automatically measuring the levator hiatal area using artificial intelligence-based methodologies whereby the C-plane within a TPUS volume is detected and subsequently traced for the levator hiatal outline. The proposed solution was determined to be accurate, relatively quick, robust and reliable and, importantly, to reduce time and expertise required for pelvic floor disorder assessment.", "The high incidence of rectal cancer in both sexes makes it one of the most common tumors, with significant morbidity and mortality rates. To define the best treatment option and optimize patient outcome, several rectal cancer biological variables must be evaluated. Currently, medical imaging plays a crucial role in the characterization of this disease, and it often requires a multimodal approach. Magnetic resonance imaging is the first-choice imaging modality for local staging and restaging and can be used to detect high-risk prognostic factors. Computed tomography is widely adopted for the detection of distant metastases. However, conventional imaging has recognized limitations, and many rectal cancer characteristics remain assessable only after surgery and histopathology evaluation. There is a growing interest in artificial intelligence applications in medicine, and imaging is by no means an exception. The introduction of radiomics, which allows the extraction of quantitative features that reflect tumor heterogeneity, allows the mining of data in medical images and paved the way for the identification of potential new imaging biomarkers. To manage such a huge amount of data, the use of machine learning algorithms has been proposed. Indeed, without prior explicit programming, they can be employed to build prediction models to support clinical decision making. In this review, current applications and future perspectives of artificial intelligence in medical imaging of rectal cancer are presented, with an imaging modality-based approach and a keen eye on unsolved issues. The results are promising, but the road ahead for translation in clinical practice is rather long.", "Since whole-slide imaging has been commercially available for over 2 decades, digital pathology has become a constantly expanding aspect of the pathology profession that will continue to significantly impact how pathologists conduct their craft. While some aspects, such as whole-slide imaging for archiving, consulting, and teaching, have gained broader acceptance, other facets such as quantitative tissue image analysis and artificial intelligence-based assessments are still met with some reservations. While most vendors in this space have focused on diagnostic applications, that is, viewing one or few slides at a time, some are developing solutions tailored more specifically to the various aspects of veterinary pathology including updated diagnostic, discovery, and research applications. This has especially advanced the use of digital pathology in toxicologic pathology and drug development, for primary reads as well as peer reviews. It is crucial that pathologists gain a deeper understanding of digital pathology and tissue image analysis technology and their applications in order to fully use these tools in a way that enhances and improves the pathologist's assessment as well as work environment. This review focuses on an updated introduction to the basics of digital pathology and image analysis and introduces emerging topics around artificial intelligence and machine learning.", "Advances in healthcare artificial intelligence (AI) are occurring rapidly and there is a growing discussion about managing its development. Many AI technologies end up owned and controlled by private entities. The nature of the implementation of AI could mean such corporations, clinics and public bodies will have a greater than typical role in obtaining, utilizing and protecting patient health information. This raises privacy issues relating to implementation and data security.\nThe first set of concerns includes access, use and control of patient data in private hands. Some recent public-private partnerships for implementing AI have resulted in poor protection of privacy. As such, there have been calls for greater systemic oversight of big data health research. Appropriate safeguards must be in place to maintain privacy and patient agency. Private custodians of data can be impacted by competing goals and should be structurally encouraged to ensure data protection and to deter alternative use thereof. Another set of concerns relates to the external risk of privacy breaches through AI-driven methods. The ability to deidentify or anonymize patient health data may be compromised or even nullified in light of new algorithms that have successfully reidentified such data. This could increase the risk to patient data under private custodianship.\nWe are currently in a familiar situation in which regulation and oversight risk falling behind the technologies they govern. Regulation should emphasize patient agency and consent, and should encourage increasingly sophisticated methods of data anonymization and protection.", "We highlight emerging uses of artificial intelligence (AI) in the field of theranostics, focusing on its significant potential to enable routine and reliable personalization of radiopharmaceutical therapies (RPTs). Personalized RPTs require patient-specific dosimetry calculations accompanying therapy. Additionally we discuss the potential to exploit biological information from diagnostic and therapeutic molecular images to derive biomarkers for absorbed dose and outcome prediction; toward personalization of therapies. We try to motivate the nuclear medicine community to expand and align efforts into making routine and reliable personalization of RPTs a reality.", "Natural products derived from microbes are crucial innovations that would help in reaching sustainability development goals worldwide while achieving bioeconomic growth. Trichoderma species are well-studied model fungal organisms used for their biocontrol properties with great potential to alleviate the use of agrochemicals in agriculture. However, identifying and characterizing effective natural products in novel species or strains as biological control products remains a meticulous process with many known challenges to be navigated. Integration of recent advancements in various \"omics\" technologies, next generation biodesign, machine learning, and artificial intelligence approaches could greatly advance bioprospecting goals. Herein, we propose a roadmap for assessing the potential impact of already known or newly discovered Trichoderma species for biocontrol applications. By screening publicly available Trichoderma genome sequences, we first highlight the prevalence of putative biosynthetic gene clusters and antimicrobial peptides among genomes as an initial step toward predicting which organisms could increase the diversity of natural products. Next, we discuss high-throughput methods for screening organisms to discover and characterize natural products and how these findings impact both fundamental and applied research fields.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) has served humanity in many applications since its inception. Currently, it dominates the imaging field-in particular, image classification. The task of image classification became much easier with machine learning (ML) and subsequently got automated and more accurate by using deep learning (DL). By default, DL consists of a single architecture and is termed solo deep learning (SDL). When two or more DL architectures are fused, the result is termed a hybrid deep learning (HDL) model. The use of HDL models is becoming popular in several applications, but no review of these uses has been designed thus far. Therefore, this study provides the first narrative HDL review by considering all facets of image classification using AI.\nOur review employs a PRISMA search strategy using Google Scholar, PubMed, IEEE, and Elsevier Science Direct, through which 127 relevant HDL studies were considered. Based on the computer vision evolution, HDLs were subsequently classified into three categories (spatial, temporal, and spatial-temporal). Each study was then analyzed based on several attributes, including continent, publisher, hybridization of two DL or ML, architecture layout, application type, data set type, dataset size, feature extraction methodology, connecting classifier, performance evaluation metrics, and risk-of-bias.\nThe HDL models have shown stable and superior performance by taking the best aspects of two or more solo DL or fusion of DL with ML models. Our findings indicate that HDL is being applied aggressively to several medical and non-medical applications. Furthermore, risk-of-bias is highly debatable for DL and HDL models.", "Pollutant emissions into the atmosphere are recognized as a significant problem in fossil fuel combustion. The pollution emission measurement in industrial boilers is difficult and expensive but fundamental for monitoring and controlling. Frequently continuous emissions monitoring (CEM) system is out of service or useless due to obsolescence, high maintenance cost, and so on or simply is not installed. When a system for measuring pollutant emissions is not available, an alternative method must be employed to get the pollutant emission value. According to the black-box model approach, this article describes the nonlinear modeling of NOx emissions from a utility boiler. Bayesian-Gaussian (BG), multilayer perceptron (MLP), and Volterra polynomial basis functions (VPBF) neural networks are developed for model benchmarking. Experimental data from a utility boiler was acquired in order to model definition and evaluation. The models process three boiler variables oxygen excess, fuel mass flow and flue gas recirculation gates for NOx emission estimation. Models with BG show better performance than models with MLP and VPBF for NOx prediction.Implications: The technology to control NOx emissions generated by combustion operates under strict regulations. In order to reduce NOx emissions, theoretical models of NOx generation have been studied extensively, including nitrogen chemistry and the dynamic flow of gas particles which is very complex. The new technology trends would require the continuous measurement of high precision NOx emissions to achieve further reductions in NOx emissions. Currently, NOx emissions are measured by a Continuous Emission Monitoring system, which turns out to be extremely expensive and difficult to maintain, so alternative low-cost solutions are desirable. Our contribution shows how algorithms based on different artificial intelligence techniques are viable and quality alternatives for the measurement of continuous NOx emissions. The NOx emissions models based on IA algorithms are viable alternatives that have versatility and self-tuning capacity due to the fact that they are based on boiler operation parameters which have valuable information few explored nowadays.", "This study examined the impact of executive functioning (EF) on adaptive functioning and self-care independence in pre-transition youth with sickle cell disease (SCD).\nThirty-four youth with SCD (ages 12-18\u2009years) completed a brief neuropsychological battery and their caregivers completed questionnaires assessing adaptive functioning, EF behaviors, and independence in completing self-care tasks, including disease management. Hierarchical linear regression analyses were utilized to investigate if EF predicted significantly more variability in adaptive functioning and self-care independence than what is accounted for by socioeconomic status (SES), disease knowledge, and estimated intellectual functioning.\nMean performance on standardized measures assessing working memory, processing speed, and EF skills fell in the low average range. Performance-based EF and caregiver-reported EF behaviors predicted variance in adaptive functioning and self-care independence above and beyond that accounted for by SES, disease knowledge, and intelligence, with moderate to large effect sizes.\nEF skills may support the ability of youth with SCD to adequately achieve independence in self-care, including medical self-care, and other adaptive skills, which may increase the likelihood of successful transition to young adulthood. These findings provide support for the role of neuropsychological screening and individualized intervention in interdisciplinary transition programs.", "Our purpose was to characterize neuropsychological evaluation (NP) outcome following functional hemispherectomy in a large, representative cohort of pediatric patients.\nWe evaluated seizure and NP outcomes and medical variables for all post-hemispherectomy patients from Seattle Children's Hospital epilepsy surgery program between 1996 and 2020. Neuropsychological evaluation outcome tests used were not available on all patients due to the diversity of patient ages and competency that is typical of a representative pediatric cohort; all patients had at least an adaptive functioning or intelligence measure, and a subgroup had memory testing.\nA total of 71 hemispherectomy patients (37 right; 34 females) yielded 66 with both preoperative (PREOP) plus postoperative (POSTOP) NPs and 5 with POSTOP only. Median surgery age was 5.7 (IQR 2-9.9) years. Engel classification indicated excellent seizure outcomes: 59 (84%) Class I, 6 (8%) Class II, 5 (7%) Class III, and 1 (1%) Class IV. Medical variables - including seizure etiology, surgery age, side, presurgical seizure duration, unilateral or bilateral structural abnormalities, secondarily generalized motor seizures - were not associated with either Engel class or POSTOP NP scores, though considerable heterogeneity was evident. Median PREOP and POSTOP adaptive functioning (PREOP n\u202f=\u202f45, POSTOP n\u202f=\u202f48) and intelligence (PREOP n\u202f=\u202f29, POSTOP n\u202f=\u202f36) summary scores were exceptionally low and did not reveal group decline from PREOP to POSTOP. Fifty-five of 66 (85%) cases showed stability or improvement. Specifically, 5 (8%) improved; 50 (76%) showed stability; and 11 (16%) declined. Improve and decline groups showed clinically interesting, but not statistical, differences in seizure control and age. Median memory summary scores were low and also showed considerable heterogeneity. Overall median PREOP to POSTOP memory scores (PREOP n\u202f=\u202f16, POSTOP n\u202f=\u202f24) did not reveal declines, and verbal memory scores improved. Twenty six percent of intelligence and 33% of memory tests had verbal versus visual-spatial discrepancies; all but one favored verbal, regardless of hemispherectomy side.\nThis large, single institution study revealed excellent seizure outcome in 91% of all 71 patients plus stability and/or improvement of intelligence and adaptive functioning in 85% of 66 patients who had PREOP plus POSTOP NPs. Memory was similarly stable overall, and verbal memory improved. Medical variables did not predict group NP outcomes though heterogeneity argues for further research. This study is unique for cohort size, intelligence plus memory testing, and evidence of primacy of verbal over visual-spatial development, despite hemispherectomy side. This study reinforces the role of hemispherectomy in achieving good seizure outcome while preserving functioning.", "Artificial intelligence has witnessed exponential growth in the past decade. Advances in computing power and the design of sophisticated artificial intelligence algorithms have enabled computers to outperform humans in a variety of tasks. Yet, artificial intelligence's path has never been smooth, having essentially fallen apart twice in its lifetime after periods of popular success. We provide a brief rundown of artificial intelligence's evolution, highlighting its crucial moments and major turning points from inception to the present. In doing so, we attempt to learn, anticipate the future, and discuss what steps may be taken to prevent another winter.", "A spiking neural network consists of artificial synapses and neurons and may realize human-level intelligence. Unlike the widely reported artificial synapses, the fabrication of large-scale artificial neurons with good performance is still challenging due to the lack of a suitable material system and integration method. Here, we report an ultrathin (less than10 nm) and inch-size two-dimensional (2D) oxide-based artificial neuron system produced by a controllable assembly of solution-processed 2D monolayer TiOx nanosheets. Artificial neuron devices based on such 2D TiOx films show a high on/off ratio of 109 and a volatile resistance switching phenomenon. The devices can not only emulate the leaky integrate-and-fire activity but also self-recover without additional circuits for sensing and reset. Moreover, the artificial neuron arrays are fabricated and exhibited good uniformity, indicating their large-area integration potential. Our results offer a strategy for fabricating large-scale and ultrathin 2D material-based artificial neurons and 2D spiking neural networks.", "The search and design for the better use of bioactive compounds are used in many experiments to best mimic compounds' functions in the human body. However, finding a cost-effective and timesaving approach is a top priority in different disciplines. Nowadays, artificial intelligence (AI) and particularly deep learning (DL) methods are widely applied to improve the precision and accuracy of models used in the drug discovery process. DL approaches have been used to provide more opportunities for a faster, efficient, cost-effective, and reliable computer-aided drug discovery. Moreover, the increasing biomedical data volume in areas, like genome sequences, medical images, protein structures, etc., has made data mining algorithms very important in finding novel compounds that could be drugs, uncovering or repurposing drugs and improving the area of genetic markers-based personalized medicine. Furthermore, deep neural networks (DNNs) have been demonstrated to outperform other techniques such as random forests and SVMs for QSAR studies and ligand-based virtual screening. Despite this, in QSAR studies, the quality of different data sources and potential experimental errors has greatly affected the accuracy of QSAR predictions. Therefore, further researches are still needed to improve the accuracy, selectivity, and sensitivity of the DL approach in building the best models of drug discovery.", "On the one hand, complexity science and enactive and embodied cognitive science approaches emphasize that people, as complex adaptive systems, are ambiguous, indeterminable, and inherently unpredictable. On the other, Machine Learning (ML) systems that claim to predict human behaviour are becoming ubiquitous in all spheres of social life. I contend that ubiquitous Artificial Intelligence (AI) and ML systems are close descendants of the Cartesian and Newtonian worldview in so far as they are tools that fundamentally sort, categorize, and classify the world, and forecast the future. Through the practice of clustering, sorting, and predicting human behaviour and action, these systems impose order, equilibrium, and stability to the active, fluid, messy, and unpredictable nature of human behaviour and the social world at large. Grounded in complexity science and enactive and embodied cognitive science approaches, this article emphasizes why people, embedded in social systems, are indeterminable and unpredictable. When ML systems \"pick up\" patterns and clusters, this often amounts to identifying historically and socially held norms, conventions, and stereotypes. Machine prediction of social behaviour, I argue, is not only erroneous but also presents real harm to those at the margins of society.", "For most digital health applications (DiGA) only limited evidence of benefit is available. Currently available assessment frameworks do not cover all domains of a\u00a0full health technology assessment (HTA). Additionally, technology-specific aspects are required for the evaluation of DiGA. This work aimed to analyze the available assessment frameworks and design an evaluation process for DiGA.\nBy a\u00a0systematic literature search six assessment frameworks for DiGA were selected and analyzed. A\u00a0hand search for strategies on DiGA of selected countries was conducted.\nOf the analyzed assessment frameworks four described study designs. One assessment framework proposed a\u00a0risk classification of DiGA. Aspects of artificial intelligence were assessed by one assessment framework. The analyzed countries have differing strategies for reimbursement of DiGA.\nAssessment frameworks for DiGA are very heterogeneous. There are efforts to find regulations for DiGA on a\u00a0national level. When evaluating DiGA, a\u00a0staged approach considering risk classes with subsequent evaluation of relevant HTA aspects is recommended.\nHINTERGRUND: F\u00fcr die meisten digitalen Gesundheitsanwendungen (DiGA) liegt wenig Evidenz zum Nutzen vor.

This is an area of active investigation, in particular in the fields of artificial intelligence, computational and cognitive neuroscience. While inductive biases and broader cognitive functions are undoubtedly important, the ability to monitor and evaluate one's performance or oneself -- metacognition -- strikes as a powerful resource for efficient learning. Often measured as decision confidence in neuroscience and psychology experiments, metacognition appears to reflect a broad range of abstraction levels and downstream behavioural effects. Within this context, the formal investigation of how metacognition interacts with learning processes is a recent endeavour. Of special interest are the neural and computational underpinnings of confidence and reinforcement learning modules. This review discusses a general hierarchy of confidence functions and their neuro-computational relevance for adaptive behaviours. It then introduces novel ways to study the formation and use of meta-representations and nonconscious mental representations related to learning and confidence, and concludes with a discussion on outstanding questions and wider perspectives.", "Researchers worldwide are seeking to repurpose existing drugs or discover new drugs to counter the disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). A promising source of candidates for such studies is molecules that have been reported in the scientific literature to be drug-like in the context of viral research. However, this literature is too large for human review and features unusual vocabularies for which existing named entity recognition (NER) models are ineffective. We report here on a project that leverages both human and artificial intelligence to detect references to such molecules in free text. We present 1) a iterative model-in-the-loop method that makes judicious use of scarce human expertise in generating training data for a NER model, and 2) the application and evaluation of this method to the problem of identifying drug-like molecules in the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset Challenge (CORD-19) corpus of 198,875 papers. We show that by repeatedly presenting human labelers only with samples for which an evolving NER model is uncertain, our human-machine hybrid pipeline requires only modest amounts of non-expert human labeling time (tens of hours to label 1778 samples) to generate an NER model with an F-1 score of 80.5%-on par with that of non-expert humans-and when applied to CORD'19, identifies 10,912 putative drug-like molecules. This enriched the computational screening team's targets by 3,591 molecules, of which 18 ranked in the top 0.1% of all 6.6\u00a0million molecules screened for docking against the 3CLPro protein.", "Screening is the pivotal strategy to relieve the burden of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) in high-risk areas. The cost, invasiveness, and accessibility of esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) necessitate the development of preliminary screening methods.\nResidents aged 40-85 years were recruited in a high-risk area of ESCC. Esophageal cells were collected using an approved novel capsule sponge, and cytology slides were scanned by a trained artificial intelligence (AI) system before cytologists provided confirmation. Atypical squamous cell or more severe diagnosis was defined as positive cytology. AI-based abnormal cell counts were also reported. EGD was performed subsequently with biopsy as needed. Diagnostic accuracy, adverse events, and acceptability of cytology testing were assessed. Esophageal high-grade lesions (ESCC and high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia) were the primary target lesions.\nIn total, 1,844 participants were enrolled, and 20 (1.1%) high-grade lesions were confirmed by endoscopic biopsy. The AI-assisted cytologist-confirmed cytology showed good diagnostic accuracy, with a sensitivity of 90.0% (95% confidence interval [CI], 76.9%-100.0%), specificity of 93.7% (95% CI, 92.6%-94.8%), and positive predictive value of 13.5% (95% CI, 7.70%-19.3%) for detecting high-grade lesions. The area under the receiver operation characteristics curve was 0.926 (95% CI, 0.850-1.000) and 0.949 (95% CI, 0.890-1.000) for AI-assisted cytologist-confirmed cytology and AI-based abnormal cell count, respectively. The numbers of EGD could be reduced by 92.5% (from 99.2 to 7.4 to detect 1 high-grade lesion) if only cytology-positive participants were referred to endoscopy. No serious adverse events were documented during the cell collection process, and 96.1% participants reported this process as acceptable.\nThe AI-assisted sponge cytology is feasible, safe, and acceptable for ESCC screening in community, with high accuracy for detecting esophageal squamous high-grade lesions.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) is booming. Among various AI approaches, generative models have received much attention in recent years. Inspired by these successes, researchers are now applying generative model techniques to de novo drug design, which has been considered as the \"holy grail\" of drug discovery. In this Perspective, we first focus on describing models such as recurrent neural network, autoencoder, generative adversarial network, transformer, and hybrid models with reinforcement learning. Next, we summarize the applications of generative models to drug design, including generating various compounds to expand the compound library and designing compounds with specific properties, and we also list a few publicly available molecular design tools based on generative models which can be used directly to generate molecules. In addition, we also introduce current benchmarks and metrics frequently used for generative models. Finally, we discuss the challenges and prospects of using generative models to aid drug design.", "Smith's (1962) demonstration that prices and allocations quickly converge to the competitive equilibrium in the continuous double auction (CDA) remains one of the most important results in experimental economics. Market experiments and exchange models have added considerably to our knowledge of how markets reach equilibrium, and how they respond to disruptions. Perhaps the best-known model of exchange in CDA market experiments is the random behavior 'zero-intelligence' (ZI) model by Gode and Sunder (1993). They argue that the CDA generates efficient allocations and 'convergence of transaction prices to the proximity of the theoretical equilibrium price,' provided only that agents meet their budget constraints. We demonstrate that prices do not converge in their simulations. Their budget constraint requires that a buyer's currency never exceeds her commodity value, which is an unnatural restriction. Their conclusion that market efficiency results from the structure of the CDA independent of traders' profit seeking behavior rests on their claim that the constraints that they impose are a part of the market institution. We show that actually they impose individual rationality. Misinterpretation of this behavioral constraint has led to unproductive debate on market adjustment processes.", "Can artificial intelligence (AI) improve the prediction of live births based on embryo images?\nThe AI system was created by using the Attention Branch Network associated with deep learning to predict the probability of live birth from 141,444 images recorded by time-lapse imaging of 470 transferred embryos, of which 91 resulted in live birth and 379 resulted in non-live birth that included implantation failure, biochemical pregnancy and clinical miscarriage. The possibility that the calculated confidence scores of each embryo and the focused areas visualized in each embryo image can help predict subsequent live birth was examined.\nThe AI system for the first time successfully visualized embryo features in focused areas that had potential to distinguish between live and non-live births. No visual feature of embryos were visualized that were associated with live or non-live births, although there were many images in which high-focused areas existed around the zona pellucida. When a cut-off level for the confidence score was set at 0.341, the live birth rate was significantly greater for embryos with a score higher than the cut-off level than for those with a score lower than the cut-off level (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). In addition, the live birth rate of embryos with good morphological quality and confidence scores higher than 0.341 was 41.1%.\nThe authors have created an AI system with a confidence score that is useful for non-invasive selection of embryos that could result in live birth. Further study is necessary to improve selection accuracy.", "Exposure to environmental factors, such as neurotoxic metals and micronutrients, during critical periods of development can contribute to long-term consequences in offspring's health, including neurodevelopmental outcomes. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between simultaneous prenatal exposure to metals [lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd), mercury (Hg)] and micronutrients [selenium (Se), zinc (Zn), copper (Cu)] and neurodevelopmental outcomes in school-age children from the Polish Mother and Child Cohort (REPRO_PL). Metals and micronutrients concentrations were measured in cord blood (Pb, Cd, Se, Zn, Cu) and in maternal hair (Hg) collected during the 3rd trimester of pregnancy. Behavioral and emotional problems, as well as children's cognitive and psychomotor development, were assessed in 436 school-age children using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ, filled in by the mothers) and the Polish adaptation of the Intelligence and Development Scales (IDS, administered by trained psychologists). Multivariate regression models were applied after imputation of missing values, using two approaches: (i) a joint analysis taking into account all metals and micronutrients simultaneously, and (ii) an ExWAS study (single-exposure model). In the SDQ, Hyperactivity/Inattention problems and Total difficulties were associated with higher Hg concentrations in maternal hair (0.18, 95% CI: 0.05; 0.3; and 0.14, 95% CI: 0.01; 0.3, respectively), whereas Emotional symptoms were inversely associated with Se and Zn levels in cord blood (-0.13, 95% CI: -0.3; 0.004; and -0.10, 95% CI: -0.2; 0.02, respectively). In the IDS, cord blood Pb levels were found to be negatively associated with Fluid and Crystallized IQ (-0.12, 95% CI: -0.3; 0.02; and -0.14, 95% CI: -0.3; 0.007, respectively) as well as Mathematical skills (-0.15, 95% CI: -0.3; 0.01). The current research has been able to simultaneously assess the exposure to various interacting chemicals during the prenatal period. We demonstrate that prenatal co-exposures to Pb, Hg, Zn and Se have long-term influences on the neuropsychological outcome of school-age children.", "Despite the low spatial resolution of 2D-multisegment late gadolinium enhancement (2D-MSLGE) sequences, it may be useful in uncooperative patients instead of standard 2D single segmented inversion recovery gradient echo late gadolinium enhancement sequences (2D-SSLGE). The aim of the study is to assess the feasibility and comparison of 2D-MSLGE reconstructed with artificial intelligence reconstruction deep learning noise reduction (NR) algorithm compared to standard 2D-SSLGE in consecutive patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICM).\nFifty-seven patients with known ICM referred for a clinically indicated CMR were enrolled in this study. 2D-MSLGE were reconstructed using a growing level of NR (0%,25%,50%,75%and 100%). Subjective image quality, signal to noise ratio (SNR) and contrast to noise ratio (CNR) were evaluated in each dataset and compared to standard 2D-SSLGE. Moreover, diagnostic accuracy, LGE mass and scan time were compared between 2D-MSLGE with NR and 2D-SSLGE.\nThe application of NR reconstruction \u226550% to 2D-MSLGE provided better subjective image quality, CNR and SNR compared to 2D-SSLGE (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). The best compromise in terms of subjective and objective image quality was observed for values of 2D-MSLGE 75%, while no differences were found in terms of LGE quantification between 2D-MSLGE versus 2D-SSLGE, regardless the NR applied. The sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value, positive predictive value and accuracy of 2D-MSLGE NR 75% were 87.77%,96.27%,96.13%,88.16% and 94.22%, respectively. Time of acquisition of 2D-MSLGE was significantly shorter compared to 2D-SSLGE (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01).\nWhen compared to standard 2D-SSLGE, the application of NR reconstruction to 2D-MSLGE provides superior image quality with similar diagnostic accuracy.", "Federated learning (FL) is a method used for training artificial intelligence models with data from multiple sources while maintaining data anonymity, thus removing many barriers to data sharing. Here we used data from 20\u2009institutes across the globe to train a FL model, called EXAM (electronic medical record (EMR) chest X-ray AI model), that predicts the future oxygen requirements of symptomatic patients with COVID-19 using inputs of vital signs, laboratory data and chest X-rays. EXAM achieved an average area under the curve (AUC) >0.92 for predicting outcomes at 24 and 72\u2009h from the time of initial presentation to the emergency room, and it provided 16% improvement in average AUC measured across all participating sites and an average increase in generalizability of 38% when compared with models trained at a single site using that site's data. For prediction of mechanical ventilation treatment or death at 24\u2009h at the largest independent test site, EXAM achieved a sensitivity of 0.950 and specificity of 0.882. In this study, FL facilitated rapid data science collaboration without data exchange and generated a model that generalized across heterogeneous, unharmonized datasets for prediction of clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19, setting the stage for the broader use of FL in healthcare.", "This article presents an overview of deep learning (DL) and its applications to function approximation for MR in medicine. The aim of this article is to help readers develop various applications of DL. DL has made a large impact on the literature of many medical sciences, including MR. However, its technical details are not easily understandable for non-experts of machine learning (ML).The first part of this article presents an overview of DL and its related technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI) and ML. AI is explained as a function that can receive many inputs and produce many outputs. ML is a process of fitting the function to training data. DL is a kind of ML, which uses a composite of many functions to approximate the function of interest. This composite function is called a deep neural network (DNN), and the functions composited into a DNN are called layers. This first part also covers the underlying technologies required for DL, such as loss functions, optimization, initialization, linear layers, non-linearities, normalization, recurrent neural networks, regularization, data augmentation, residual connections, autoencoders, generative adversarial networks, model and data sizes, and complex-valued neural networks.The second part of this article presents an overview of the applications of DL in MR and explains how functions represented as DNNs are applied to various applications, such as RF pulse, pulse sequence, reconstruction, motion correction, spectroscopy, parameter mapping, image synthesis, and segmentation.", "A viral outbreak is a global challenge that affects public health and safety. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been spreading globally, affecting millions of people worldwide, and led to significant loss of lives and deterioration of the global economy. The current adverse effects caused by the COVID-19 pandemic demands finding new detection methods for future viral outbreaks. The environment's transmission pathways include and are not limited to air, surface water, and wastewater environments. The wastewater surveillance, known as wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE), can potentially monitor viral outbreaks and provide a complementary clinical testing method. Another investigated outbreak surveillance technique that has not been yet implemented in a sufficient number of studies is the surveillance of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the air. Artificial intelligence (AI) and its related machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) technologies are currently emerging techniques for detecting viral outbreaks using global data. To date, there are no reports that illustrate the potential of using WBE with AI to detect viral outbreaks. This study investigates the transmission pathways of SARS-CoV-2 in the environment and provides current updates on the surveillance of viral outbreaks using WBE, viral air sampling, and AI. It also proposes a novel framework based on an ensemble of ML and DL algorithms to provide a beneficial supportive tool for decision-makers. The framework exploits available data from reliable sources to discover meaningful insights and knowledge that allows researchers and practitioners to build efficient methods and protocols that accurately monitor and detect viral outbreaks. The proposed framework could provide early detection of viruses, forecast risk maps and vulnerable areas, and estimate the number of infected citizens.", "Plasmons of noble metal nanoparticles have played an important role in energy transfer research, biomedical sensing, drug preparation and photocatalysis in recent years. The scattering spectra of nanoparticles are dramatically affected by numerous complex parameters, such as morphology, material, and volumes, making the parameters design a necessary step before the experiment. However, the plasmonic design is limited by several difficulties, such as the high degree of freedom, expensive trial and error costs. Herein, a plasmonic design method based on dual strategy deep learning is proposed, which can provide the design proposals according to the required spectrum. To make the model closer to the real experimental situation, the boundary element method was used to build a scattering spectra dataset of geometric nanoparticles (>1200 000 samples). Driven by the above data, the artificial intelligence (AI) model learns the relationship between spectral features and design parameters. Then, the performance statistics of the model were implemented from multiple dimensions, and a high design precision of over 90% was achieved in testing cases (testing samples >120 000). Moreover, to verify the realizability of the proposed model, the scattering spectra of nanoparticles designed by AI were constructed using a dark-field microscope system. The experimental results showed that the deviation between the target and the actual spectra was very small and within the acceptable range. This proves the realizability of the AI model proposed in this paper, and sheds light on the application of AI in plasmonic design.", "Though artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to augment the patient-physician relationship in primary care, bias in intelligent health care systems has the potential to differentially impact vulnerable patient populations.\nThe purpose of this scoping review is to summarize the extent to which AI systems in primary care examine the inherent bias toward or against vulnerable populations and appraise how these systems have mitigated the impact of such biases during their development.\nWe will conduct a search update from an existing scoping review to identify studies on AI and primary care in the following databases: Medline-OVID, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Scopus, IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, MathSciNet, AAAI, and arXiv. Two screeners will independently review all abstracts, titles, and full-text articles. The team will extract data using a structured data extraction form and synthesize the results in accordance with PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews) guidelines.\nThis review will provide an assessment of the current state of health care equity within AI for primary care. Specifically, we will identify the degree to which vulnerable patients have been included, assess how bias is interpreted and documented, and understand the extent to which harmful biases are addressed. As of October 2020, the scoping review is in the title- and abstract-screening stage. The results are expected to be submitted for publication in fall 2021.\nAI applications in primary care are becoming an increasingly common tool in health care delivery and in preventative care efforts for underserved populations. This scoping review would potentially show the extent to which studies on AI in primary care employ a health equity lens and take steps to mitigate bias.\nPRR1-10.2196/27799.", "Advances in public health and medical care have enabled better pregnancy and birth outcomes. The rates of perinatal health indicators such as maternal mortality and morbidity; fetal, neonatal, and infant mortality; low birthweight; and preterm birth have reduced over time. However, they are still a public health concern, and considerable disparities exist within and between countries. For perinatal researchers who are engaged in unraveling the tangled web of causation for maternal and child health outcomes and for clinicians involved in the care of pregnant women and infants, artificial intelligence offers novel approaches to prediction modeling, diagnosis, early detection, and monitoring in perinatal health. Machine learning, a commonly used artificial intelligence method, has been used to predict preterm birth, birthweight, preeclampsia, mortality, hypertensive disorders, and postpartum depression. Real-time electronic health recording and predictive modeling using artificial intelligence have found early success in fetal monitoring and monitoring of women with gestational diabetes especially in low-resource settings. Artificial intelligence-based methodologies have the potential to improve prenatal diagnosis of birth defects and outcomes in assisted reproductive technology too. In this scenario, we envision artificial intelligence for perinatal research to be based on three goals: (1) availability of population-representative, routine clinical data (rich multimodal data of large sample size) for perinatal research; (2) modification and application of current state-of-the-art artificial intelligence for prediction and classification in health care research to the field of perinatal health; and (3) development of methods for explaining the decision-making processes of artificial intelligence models for perinatal health indicators. Achieving these three goals via a multidisciplinary approach to the development of artificial intelligence tools will enable trust in these tools and advance research, clinical practice, and policies to ensure optimal perinatal health.", "To study the difference in cognitive impairment between the children with benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (BECT) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and those with BECT or ADHD alone.\nA prospective study was performed on 80 children with BECT and ADHD, 91 children with BECT, and 70 children with ADHD , who were diagnosed with the diseases for the first time. Seventy children of the same age who underwent physical examination were enrolled as the healthy control group.

Vaccine hesitancy plays an important role in the decreasing rates of vaccination and is considered by the World Health Organization as a top ten global threat to public health. Online vaccine misinformation is present in news outlets, websites, and social media, and its rapid and extensive dissemination is aided by artificial intelligence (AI). In combating online misinformation, public health experts, the medical community, and lay vaccination advocates can correct false statements using language that appeal to those who are undecided about vaccination. As the gatekeepers to online information, they can implement and enforce policy that limits or bans vaccine misinformation on their platforms. AI tools might also be used to address misinformation, but more research is needed before implementing this approach more broadly in health policy. This commentary examines the role that different online platforms appear to be playing in the spread of misinformation about vaccines. We also discuss the implications of online misinformation on attitudes about COVID-19 vaccine uptake and provide suggestions for ways to combat online misinformation.\nVaccine hesitancy, the rejection or delay to get vaccinated even if there is an effective vaccine available, may be instrumental in the resurgence of vaccine-preventable disease. Studies have shown that the rise in nonmedical exemptions for vaccination increases rates of childhood vaccine-preventable disease. One factor that influences vaccine hesitancy is online misinformation. False or misleading information online regarding vaccines can be found in independent news outlets, websites, and social media. The spread of vaccine misinformation is especially important during the COVID-19 pandemic as false information can decrease pro-vaccine opinions. The recent announcement of an effective COVID-19 vaccine became a hot topic online, with many adults hesitant to take the vaccine. Public health experts, medical professionals, and pro-vaccine individuals can help curb the spread of misinformation by correcting false statements online. Social media companies can also aid in stopping misinformation by implementing and enforcing policy that limits misinformation on their platforms.", "Stream waters play a crucial role in catering to the world's needs with the required quality of water. Due to the discharges of wastewater from the various point and nonpoint sources, most of the watersheds are contaminated easily. The Upper Green River watershed in Kentucky, USA, is one such watershed that is contaminated over the years due to the runoff from rural areas and agricultural lands and combined sewer overflows (CSOs) from urban areas. Monitoring and characterizing the water quality status of streams in such watersheds has become of great importance, with multivariate statistical techniques such as regression, factor analysis, cluster analysis, and artificial intelligence methods such as artificial neural networks (ANNs). The water quality parameters, namely, fecal coliform (FC), turbidity, pH, and conductivity have been predicted quantitatively using ANNs to understand the water quality status of streams in the Upper Green River watershed elsewhere. In this study, a novel attempt has been made to predict the status of the quality of the Green River water with the predictive capabilities of a few decision tree (DT) algorithms such as classification and regression tree (CART) model, multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) model, random forest (RF) model, and extreme learning machine (ELM) model. The RF model's performance is better in predicting FC, turbidity, and pH than CART models in training and testing phases. Relatively, MARS and ELM models did better in testing though the performance is poorer in training. For example, we obtain the RMSE values of 2206, 2532, 1533, and 1969 using RF, CART, MARS, and ELM for FC in testing. A good correlation has been observed between conductivity and temperature, precipitation, and land-use factors for the MARS model. Overall, DT models are helpful in understanding, interpreting the outcomes, and visualizing the results compared with the other models. PRACTITIONER POINTS: The prediction of stream water quality parameters using decision trees is explored. The climate and land use parameters are used as input parameters to the modeling. The DT models of CART, MARS, RF, and ANNs such as ELM are explored to predict stream water quality. The RF model shows stable results compared with CART, MARS, and ELM for the data explored. Apart from the R2 value, RMSE and MAE indicate the effectiveness of DTs in prediction.", "The application of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning to the field of orthopaedic surgery is rapidly increasing. While this represents an important step in the advancement of our specialty, the concept of AI is rich with statistical jargon and techniques unfamiliar to many clinicians. This knowledge gap may limit the impact and potential of these novel techniques. We aim to narrow this gap in a way that is accessible for all orthopaedic surgeons. With this manuscript, we introduce the concept of AI and machine learning and give examples of how it can impact clinical practice and patient care.Level of evidence VI.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) is a subset of computer science dealing with the development and training of algorithms that try to replicate human intelligence. We report a clinical overview of the basic principles of AI that are fundamental to appreciating its application to ophthalmology practice. Here, we review the most common eye diseases, focusing on some of the potential challenges and limitations emerging with the development and application of this new technology into ophthalmology.", "Multiple studies have compared the performance of artificial intelligence (AI)-based models for automated skin cancer classification to human experts, thus setting the cornerstone for a successful translation of AI-based tools into clinicopathological practice.\nThe objective of the study was to systematically analyse the current state of research on reader studies involving melanoma and to assess their potential clinical relevance by evaluating three main aspects: test set characteristics (holdout/out-of-distribution data set, composition), test setting (experimental/clinical, inclusion of metadata) and representativeness of participating clinicians.\nPubMed, Medline and ScienceDirect were screened for peer-reviewed studies published between 2017 and 2021 and dealing with AI-based skin cancer classification involving melanoma. The search terms skin cancer classification, deep learning, convolutional neural network (CNN), melanoma (detection), digital biomarkers, histopathology and whole slide imaging were combined. Based on the search results, only studies that considered direct comparison of AI results with clinicians and had a diagnostic classification as their main objective were included.\nA total of 19 reader studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Of these, 11 CNN-based approaches addressed the classification of dermoscopic images; 6 concentrated on the classification of clinical images, whereas 2 dermatopathological studies utilised digitised histopathological whole slide images.\nAll 19 included studies demonstrated superior or at least equivalent performance of CNN-based classifiers compared with clinicians. However, almost all studies were conducted in highly artificial settings based exclusively on single images of the suspicious lesions. Moreover, test sets mainly consisted of holdout images and did not represent the full range of patient populations and melanoma subtypes encountered in clinical practice.", "The typical curriculum of training and educating future clinicians, biomedical engineers, health IT, and artificial intelligence experts lacks needed twenty first-century skills like problem-solving, stakeholder empathy, curiosity stimulation, entrepreneurship, and health economics, which are essential generators and are pre-requirements for creating intentional disruptive innovations. Moreover, the translation from research to a valuable and affordable product/process innovation is not formalized by the current teachings that focus on short-term rather than long-term developments, leading to inaccurate and incremental forecasting on the future of healthcare and longevity. The Stanford Biodesign approach of unmet clinical need detection would be an excellent starting methodology for health-related innovation work, although unfortunately not widely taught yet. We have developed a novel lecture titled HealthTec Innovation Design (HTID) offered in an interdisciplinary setup to medical students and biomedical engineers. It teaches a future-oriented view and the application and effects of exponential trends. We implemented a novel approach using the Purpose Launchpad meta-methodology combined with other innovation generation tools to define, experiment, and validate existing project ideas. As part of the process of defining the novel curriculum, we used experimentation methods, like a global science fiction event to create a comic book with Future Health stories and an Innovation Think Tank Certification Program of a large medical technology company that is focused on identifying future health opportunities. We conducted before and after surveys and concluded that the proposed initiatives were impactful in developing an innovative design thinking approach. Participants' awareness and enthusiasm were raised, including their willingness to implement taught skills, values, and methods in their working projects. We conclude that a new curriculum based on HTID is essential and needed to move the needle of healthcare activities from treating sickness to maintaining health.", "Recent research on artificial intelligence has demonstrated that natural language can be used to provide valid indicators of psychopathology. The present study examined artificial intelligence-based language predictors (ALPs) of seven trauma-related mental and physical health outcomes in responders to the World Trade Center disaster.\nThe responders (N\u00a0=\u00a0174, Mage\u00a0=\u00a055.4 years) provided daily voicemail updates over 14 days. Algorithms developed using machine learning in large social media discovery samples were applied to the voicemail transcriptions to derive ALP scores for several risk factors (depressivity, anxiousness, anger proneness, stress, and personality). Responders also completed self-report assessments of these risk factors at baseline and trauma-related mental and physical health outcomes at two-year follow-up (including symptoms of depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, sleep disturbance, respiratory problems, and GERD).\nVoicemail ALPs were significantly associated with a majority of the trauma-related outcomes at two-year follow-up, over and above corresponding baseline self-reports. ALPs showed significant convergence with corresponding self-report scales, but also considerable uniqueness from each other and from self-report scales.\nThe study has a relatively short follow-up period relative to trauma occurrence and a limited sample size.\nThis study shows evidence that ALPs may provide a novel, objective, and clinically useful approach to forecasting, and may in the future help to identify individuals at risk for negative health outcomes.", "Non-invasive multi-disease detection is an active technology that detects human diseases automatically. By observing images of the human body, computers can make inferences on disease detection based on artificial intelligence and computer vision techniques. The sublingual vein, lying on the lower part of the human tongue, is a critical identifier in non-invasive multi-disease detection, reflecting health status. However, few studies have fully investigated non-invasive multi-disease detection via the sublingual vein using a quantitative method. In this paper, a two-phase sublingual-based disease detection framework for non-invasive multi-disease detection was proposed. In this framework, sublingual vein region segmentation was performed on each image in the first phase to achieve the region with the highest probability of covering the sublingual vein. In the second phase, features in this region were extracted, and multi-class classification was applied to these features to output a detection result. To better represent the characterisation of the obtained sublingual vein region, multi-feature representations were generated of the sublingual vein region (based on color, texture, shape, and latent representation). The effectiveness of sublingual-based multi-disease detection was quantitatively evaluated, and the proposed framework was based on 1103 sublingual vein images from patients in different health status categories. The best multi-feature representation was generated based on color, texture, and latent representation features with the highest accuracy of 98.05%.", "Intellectual disability (ID) is a neurodevelopmental disorder affecting approximately 0.5-3% of the population in the developed world. Individuals with ID exhibit deficits in intelligence, impaired adaptive behavior and often visual impairments. Cytoplasmic fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1)-interacting protein 2 (CYFIP2) is an interacting partner of the FMR protein, whose loss results in fragile X syndrome, the most common inherited cause of ID. Recently, CYFIP2 variants have been found in patients with early-onset epileptic encephalopathy, developmental delay and ID. Such individuals often exhibit visual impairments; however, the underlying mechanism is poorly understood. In the present study, we investigated the role of Cyfip2 in retinal and visual functions by generating and analyzing Cyfip2 conditional knockout (CKO) mice. While we found no major differences in the layer structures and cell compositions between the control and Cyfip2 CKO retinas, a subset of genes associated with the transporter and channel activities was differentially expressed in Cyfip2 CKO retinas than in the controls. Multi-electrode array recordings showed more sustained and stronger responses to positive flashes of the ON ganglion cells in the Cyfip2 CKO retina than in the controls, although electroretinogram analysis revealed that Cyfip2 deficiency unaffected the photoreceptor and ON bipolar cell functions. Furthermore, analysis of initial and late phase optokinetic responses demonstrated that Cyfip2 deficiency impaired the visual function at the organismal level. Together, our results shed light on the molecular mechanism underlying the visual impairments observed in individuals with CYFIP2 variants and, more generally, in patients with neurodevelopmental disorders, including ID.", "Approximately 60%-80% of the primary care visits have a psychological stress component, but only 3% of patients receive stress management advice during these visits. Given recent advances in natural language processing, there is renewed interest in mental health chatbots. Conversational agents that can understand a user's problems and deliver advice that mitigates the effects of daily stress could be an effective public health tool. However, such systems are complex to build and costly to develop.\nTo address these challenges, our aim is to develop and evaluate a fully automated mobile suite of shallow chatbots-we call them Popbots-that may serve as a new species of chatbots and further complement human assistance in an ecosystem of stress management support.\nAfter conducting an exploratory Wizard of Oz study (N=14) to evaluate the feasibility of a suite of multiple chatbots, we conducted a web-based study (N=47) to evaluate the implementation of our prototype. Each participant was randomly assigned to a different chatbot designed on the basis of a proven cognitive or behavioral intervention method. To measure the effectiveness of the chatbots, the participants' stress levels were determined using self-reported psychometric evaluations (eg, web-based daily surveys and Patient Health Questionnaire-4). The participants in these studies were recruited through email and enrolled on the web, and some of them participated in follow-up interviews that were conducted in person or on the web (as necessary).\nOf the 47 participants, 31 (66%) completed the main study. The findings suggest that the users viewed the conversations with our chatbots as helpful or at least neutral and came away with increasingly positive sentiment toward the use of chatbots for proactive stress management. Moreover, those users who used the system more often (ie, they had more than or equal to the median number of conversations) noted a decrease in depression symptoms compared with those who used the system less often based on a Wilcoxon signed-rank test (W=91.50; Z=-2.54; P=.01; r=0.47). The follow-up interviews with a subset of the participants indicated that half of the common daily stressors could be discussed with chatbots, potentially reducing the burden on human coping resources.\nOur work suggests that suites of shallow chatbots may offer benefits for both users and designers. As a result, this study's contributions include the design and evaluation of a novel suite of shallow chatbots for daily stress management, a summary of benefits and challenges associated with random delivery of multiple conversational interventions, and design guidelines and directions for future research into similar systems, including authoring chatbot systems and artificial intelligence-enabled recommendation algorithms.", "Vaccine use during pregnancy affects maternal and infant health. Many women do not receive vaccines recommended during pregnancy; conversely, inadvertent exposure to vaccines contraindicated or not recommended during pregnancy may occur. We assessed exposure to two recommended vaccines and two vaccines not recommended during pregnancy among privately and Medicaid-insured women in the United States.\nThis study includes a retrospective cohort of pregnancies in women aged 12-55\u00a0years resulting in live birth, spontaneous abortion, or stillbirth identified in the IBM\u00ae MarketScan\u00ae Commercial, Blue Health Intelligence\u00ae (BHI\u00ae) Commercial, and IBM MarketScan Multi-State Medicaid Databases from August 1, 2016, to December 31, 2018. Gestational age at vaccination was determined using a validated algorithm. We examined vaccines (1) recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) (tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis [Tdap]; inactivated influenza) and (2) not recommended (human papillomavirus [HPV]) or contraindicated (measles, mumps, and rubella [MMR]).\nWe identified 496,771 (MarketScan Commercial), 858,961 (BHI), and 289,573 (MarketScan Medicaid) pregnancies (approximately 75% aged 20-34\u00a0years). Across these three databases, 52.1%, 50.3%, and 31.3% of pregnancies, respectively, received Tdap, most often at a gestational age of 28\u00a0weeks, and influenza vaccination occurred in 32.1%, 30.8%, and 18.0% of pregnancies, respectively. HPV vaccination occurred in\u00a0<\u00a00.2% of pregnancies, mostly in the first trimester among women aged 12-19\u00a0years, and MMR was administered in\u00a0<\u00a00.1% of pregnancies. Use of other contraindicated vaccines per ACIP (e.g., varicella, live attenuated influenza) was rare.\nMaternal vaccination with ACIP-recommended vaccines was suboptimal among privately and Medicaid-insured patients, with lower vaccination coverage among Medicaid-insured pregnancies than their privately insured counterparts. Inadvertent exposure to contraindicated vaccines during pregnancy was rare. This study evaluated only vaccinations reimbursed among insured populations and may have limited generalizability to uninsured populations.", "With the continuous expansion of aquaculture scale and density, contemporary aquaculture methods have been forced to overproduce resulting in the accelerated imbalance rate of water environment, the frequent occurrence of fish diseases, and the decline of aquatic product quality. Moreover, due to the fact that the average age profile of agricultural workers in many parts of the world are on the higher side, fishery production will face the dilemma of shortage of labor, and aquaculture methods are in urgent need of change. Modern information technology has gradually penetrated into various fields of agriculture, and the concept of intelligent fish farm has also begun to take shape. The intelligent fish farm tries to deal with the precise work of increasing oxygen, optimizing feeding, reducing disease incidences, and accurately harvesting through the idea of \"replacing human with machine,\" so as to liberate the manpower completely and realize the green and sustainable aquaculture. This paper reviews the application of fishery intelligent equipment, IoT, edge computing, 5G, and artificial intelligence algorithms in modern aquaculture, and analyzes the existing problems and future development prospects. Meanwhile, based on different business requirements, the design frameworks for key functional modules in the construction of intelligent fish farm are proposed.", "We investigated the association of metabolic syndrome (MetS) and its components [abdominal obesity, elevated triglycerides (TG), low HDL cholesterol, elevated blood pressure (BP), and impaired fasting glycemia (IFG)] with neurocognitive impairment in youth with perinatally acquired HIV (YPHIV) or who are perinatally HIV-exposed uninfected (YPHEU).\u00a0This was an observational study with a comparison group of 350 YPHIV and 68 YPHEU ages 10-19\u00a0years.\u00a0Youth with MetS components measured between 1\u00a0year before and 3\u00a0months after a baseline neurocognitive assessment (Wechsler Intelligence Scale) were selected from the Pediatric HIV/AIDS Cohort Study (PHACS). A sub-group completed another assessment 3\u00a0years later. We assessed the association of each baseline MetS component with five standardized neurocognitive indices at baseline and changes in indices over time.\u00a0At baseline, 15% of YPHIV and 18% of YPHEU met criteria for\u2009\u2265\u20092 MetS components. Among YPHIV, there was no association between MetS components and neurocognitive indices at baseline; however, over time, elevated baseline BP was associated with a greater decrease in mean Perceptual Reasoning scores (-4.3;95%CI:\u2009-8.8,0.3) and\u2009\u2265\u20092 MetS components with a greater decrease in mean Processing Speed scores (-5.1;95%CI:\u2009-9.4,\u2009-0.8). Among YPHEU, elevated TG was associated with lower mean Verbal Comprehension, Perceptual Reasoning, and Full-scale IQ scores at baseline, and IFG with lower mean Verbal Comprehension scores. Components of MetS in YPHIV (elevated BP) and YPHEU (elevated TG and IFG) were associated with lower neurocognitive performance index scores. Studies to elucidate how modifying metabolic risk factors early in life may improve neurocognitive outcomes in this population are warranted.", "To use reliable change indices (RCIs) developed specifically for pediatric patients with epilepsy to examine cognitive outcomes after frontal lobe resection for pharmacoresistant epilepsy.\nForty-one pediatric patients (25 male, Mage\u202f=\u202f10\u202fyears) completed comprehensive neuropsychological evaluations before and an average of 6.5\u202fmonths after frontal lobe resections for treatment of epilepsy. Evaluations included tests of intelligence, attention/working memory, processing speed, language, visuospatial skills, executive function, and episodic memory. Practice effect-adjusted RCIs were used to determine clinically significant postoperative cognitive change. Demographic, disease, and surgical variables were examined to identify factors associated with postoperative cognitive decline or improvement.\nWithin each cognitive domain, there was a large proportion of patients (51-84%) who did not exhibit significant cognitive change. In terms of overall cognitive profile, 44% demonstrated improvement in at least one domain and 69% declined in at least one domain. Postoperative cognitive improvement occurred most commonly in the domain of processing speed, whereas postoperative cognitive decline occurred most frequently in the domain of visuospatial skills. Younger age at surgery was associated with cognitive improvement. Older age at seizure onset and higher baseline cognitive performance were associated with cognitive decline.\nApproximately 6.5\u202fmonths after frontal lobe resection, only 15% of our sample showed stable performance across all cognitive domains. Seventeen percent of patients showed improvements without declines, 42% showed declines without improvements, and 27% showed a mix of improvements and declines across different cognitive domains. Age and baseline abilities were associated with postoperative cognitive change on multiple measures. With 1 in 8 children demonstrating postoperative decline across three or more domains, further research is needed to identify factors associated with cognitive decline in order to inform clinical decision-making and patient/family counseling.", "This study highlights new opportunities for optimal reaction route selection from large chemical databases brought about by the rapid digitalisation of chemical data. The chemical industry requires a transformation towards more sustainable practices, eliminating its dependencies on fossil fuels and limiting its impact on the environment. However, identifying more sustainable process alternatives is, at present, a cumbersome, manual, iterative process, based on chemical intuition and modelling. We give a perspective on methods for automated discovery and assessment of competitive sustainable reaction routes based on renewable or waste feedstocks. Three key areas of transition are outlined and reviewed based on their state-of-the-art as well as bottlenecks: (i) data, (ii) evaluation metrics, and (iii) decision-making. We elucidate their synergies and interfaces since only together these areas can bring about the most benefit. The field of chemical data intelligence offers the opportunity to identify the inherently more sustainable reaction pathways and to identify opportunities for a circular chemical economy. Our review shows that at present the field of data brings about most bottlenecks, such as data completion and data linkage, but also offers the principal opportunity for advancement.", "capsule endoscopy (CE) revolutionized the study of the small intestine. Nevertheless, reviewing CE images is time-consuming and prone to error. Artificial intelligence algorithms, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNN), are expected to overcome these drawbacks. Protruding lesions of the small intestine exhibit enormous morphological diversity in CE images. This study aimed to develop a CNN-based algorithm for the automatic detection small bowel protruding lesions.\na CNN was developed using a pool of CE images containing protruding lesions or normal mucosa from 1,229 patients. A training dataset was used for the development of the model. The performance of the network was evaluated using an independent dataset, by calculating its sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive and negative predictive values.\na total of 18,625 CE images (2,830 showing protruding lesions and 15,795 normal mucosa) were included. Training and validation datasets were built with an 80 %/20 % distribution, respectively. After optimizing the architecture of the network, our model automatically detected small-bowel protruding lesions with an accuracy of 92.5 %. CNN had a sensitivity and specificity of 96.8 % and 96.5 %, respectively. The CNN analyzed the validation dataset in 53 seconds, at a rate of approximately 70 frames per second.\nwe developed an accurate CNN for the automatic detection of enteric protruding lesions with a wide range of morphologies. The development of these tools may enhance the diagnostic efficiency of CE.", "Cardiac CT-Scan and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are two booming cardiac imaging modalities especially in chest pain screening for CT-Scan and in surveillance of patients with known coronary artery disease for MRI. Artificial Intelligence is already of great help in radiologic diagnosis and its use should widen in the next few years. Teleradiology allows remote interpretation of all radiology exams and should develop in cardiac imaging. Expert radiology diagnosis centers should develop gathering cardiologists and radiologists with great experience in the field of cardiac imaging interpretation. Peripheral acquisition radiology centers would be disseminated all across the country without a need for a local expert and would send their images to the expert center for interpretation. The expert center would be the middle of this spider web, sending back the report and the selected images to the peripheral center, allowing optimal care for all patients nationwide. Artificial Intelligence would be a major asset of these expert centers, improving through the years. This operating mode would allow the onset of systematic screening for coronary artery disease in the global population and the surveillance of known coronary artery disease treated patients.", "With the continuous enrichment of scientific and technological means, the production of most chicken farms has been able to achieve automation, but for the dead and sick chickens in the farm, there is no automatic monitoring step, only through continuous manual inspection and discovery. In the face of this problem, there are many solutions to identify dead and sick chickens through sound and image, but they can not achieve the ideal effect. In this paper, a sensor detection method based on artificial intelligence is proposed. This method 1) The maximum displacement of chicken activity is measured by fastening a foot ring on each chicken, and the three-dimensional total variance is designed and calculated to represent the chicken activity intensity. 2) The detection terminal collects the sensing data of foot ring through ZigBee network. 3) The state of chicken (dead chicken and sick chicken) can be identified by machine learning algorithm. This method of artificial intelligence combined with sensor network not only has high recognition rate, but also can reduce the operation cost. The practical results show that the accuracy of the system to identify dead and sick chickens is 95.6%, and the cost of the system running for 4 years can be reduced by 25% compared with manual operation.", "Ehrlichioses and anaplasmosis have undergone dramatic increases in incidence, and the geographic ranges of their occurrence and vectors have also expanded. There is marked underreporting of these diseases owing to deficient physician awareness and knowledge of the illnesses as well as limited access to appropriate diagnostic tests. Human monocytic ehrlichiosis and anaplasmosis are life threatening diseases with estimated case fatality rates of 2.7 and 0.3%, respectively. However, knowledge of their full range of signs and symptoms is incomplete, and the incidence of subclinical infections is unknown. Currently available laboratory diagnostic methods are poorly utilized, and with the exception of nucleic acid amplification tests are not useful for diagnosis during the acute stage of illness when timely treatment is needed. The Ehrlichiosis and Anaplasmosis Subcommittee of the Tick-Borne Disease Working Group recommended active clinical surveillance to determine the true incidence, full clinical spectrum, and risk factors for severe illness, as well as standardized surveillance of ticks for these pathogens, and enhanced education of primary medical caregivers and the public regarding these diseases. The subcommittee identified the needs to develop sensitive, specific acute stage diagnostic tests for local clinical laboratories and point-of-care testing, to develop approaches for utilizing electronic medical records, data mining, and artificial intelligence for assisting early diagnosis and treatment, and to develop adjunctive therapies for severe disease.", "The U.S. Department of Energy is considering implementing the direct feed approach for the vitrification of low-activity waste (LAW) and high-level waste (HLW) at the Hanford site in Washington state. If implemented, the nuclear waste with a higher concentration of alkali/alkaline-earth sulfates (than expected under the previously proposed vitrification scheme) will be sent to the vitrification facility. It will be difficult for the existing empirical models to predict sulfate solubility in these glasses or design glass formulations with enhanced sulfate loadings in such a scenario. Further, the existing models are unable to produce reliable predictions when applied to HLW glasses whose composition falls outside of the range encompassed by the database used to develop/calibrate the models. Accordingly, this study harnesses the power of artificial intelligence (machine learning, ML) with a goal to address the limitations of the existing models. Toward this, three ML models have been trained using a large database; comprising >1000 LAW and HLW glasses and encompassing a wide range of glass compositions and processing variables. Next, the ML model with the best prediction performance has been used to quantitatively assess and rank the influence (i.e., importance) of glasses' compositional/processing variables on the SO3 solubility in the glasses. Finally, on the premise of such understanding of influential and inconsequential variables, two closed-form analytical models\u2500with disparate degrees of complexity (one highly parametrized and one with fewer input variables)\u2500have been developed. Results show that both analytical models produce predictions of SO3 solubility in LAW and HLW glasses with an accuracy analogous to ML models and substantially higher than the analytical models that represent the current state-of-the-art. Overall, this study's outcomes present a roadmap\u2500informed by data and channeled by artificial intelligence\u2500that can be leveraged in the future to design nuclear waste glasses with unprecedented sulfur loadings.", "Although individual neurons are the basic unit of the nervous system, they process information by working together in neuronal circuits with specific patterns of synaptic connectivity. Here, I review common circuit motifs and architectural plans used in diverse brain regions and animal species. I also consider how these circuit architectures assemble during development and might have evolved. Understanding how specific patterns of synaptic connectivity can implement specific neural computations will help to bridge the huge gap between the biology of the individual neuron and the function of the entire brain, allow us to better understand the neural basis of behavior, and may inspire new advances in artificial intelligence.", "A primary objective of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is expansion of humankind's presence outside low-Earth orbit, culminating in permanent interplanetary travel and habitation. Having no inherent means of physiological detection or protection against ionizing radiation, humans incur capricious risk when journeying beyond low-Earth orbit for long periods. NASA has made large investments to analyze pathologies from space radiation exposure, emphasizing the importance of characterizing radiation's physiological effects. Because natural evolution would require many generations to confer resistance against space radiation, immediately pragmatic approaches should be considered. Volitional evolution, defined as humans steering their own heredity, may inevitably retrofit the genome to mitigate resultant pathologies from space radiation exposure. Recently, uniquely radioprotective genes have been identified, conferring local or systemic radiotolerance when overexpressed in vitro and in vivo. Aiding in this process, the CRISPR/Cas9 technique is an inexpensive and reproducible instrument capable of making limited additions and deletions to the genome. Although cohorts can be identified and engineered to protect against radiation, alternative and supplemental strategies should be seriously considered. Advanced propulsion and mild synthetic torpor are perhaps the most likely to be integrated. Interfacing artificial intelligence with genetic engineering using predefined boundary conditions may enable the computational modeling of otherwise overly complex biological networks. The ethical context and boundaries of introducing genetically pioneered humans are considered.", "Serological diagnosis of active tuberculosis (TB) is enhanced by detection of multiple antibodies due to variable immune responses among patients. Clinical interpretation of these complex datasets requires development of suitable algorithms, a time consuming and tedious undertaking addressed by the automated machine learning platform MILO (Machine Intelligence Learning Optimizer). MILO seamlessly integrates data processing, feature selection, model training, and model validation to simultaneously generate and evaluate thousands of models. These models were then further tested for generalizability on out-of-sample secondary and tertiary datasets. Out of 31 antigens evaluated, a 23-antigen model was the most robust on both the secondary dataset (TB vs healthy) and the tertiary dataset (TB vs COPD) with sensitivity of 90.5% and respective specificities of 100.0% and 74.6%. MILO represents a user-friendly, end-to-end solution for automated generation and deployment of optimized models, ideal for applications where rapid clinical implementation is critical such as emerging infectious diseases.", "Rising global population and climate change realities dictate that agricultural productivity must be accelerated. Results from current traditional research approaches are difficult to extrapolate to all possible fields because they are dependent on specific soil types, weather conditions, and background management combinations that are not applicable nor translatable to all farms. A method that accurately evaluates the effectiveness of infinite cropping system interactions (involving multiple management practices) to increase maize and soybean yield across the US does not exist. Here, we utilize extensive databases and artificial intelligence algorithms and show that complex interactions, which cannot be evaluated in replicated trials, are associated with large crop yield variability and thus, potential for substantial yield increases. Our approach can accelerate agricultural research, identify sustainable practices, and help overcome future food demands.", "Contour delineation, a crucial process in radiation oncology, is time-consuming and inaccurate due to inter-observer variation has been a critical issue in this process. An atlas-based automatic segmentation was developed to improve the delineation efficiency and reduce inter-observer variation. Additionally, automated segmentation using artificial intelligence (AI) has recently become available. In this study, auto-segmentations by atlas- and AI-based models for Organs at Risk (OAR) in patients with prostate and head and neck cancer were performed and delineation accuracies were evaluated.\nTwenty-one patients with prostate cancer and 30 patients with head and neck cancer were evaluated. MIM Maestro was used to apply the atlas-based segmentation. MIM Contour Prot\u00e9g\u00e9AI was used to apply the AI-based segmentation. Three similarity indices, the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), Hausdorff distance (HD), and mean distance to agreement (MDA), were evaluated and compared with manual delineations. In addition, radiation oncologists visually evaluated the delineation accuracies.\nAmong patients with prostate cancer, the AI-based model demonstrated higher accuracy than the atlas-based on DSC, HD, and MDA for the bladder and rectum. Upon visual evaluation, some errors were observed in the atlas-based delineations when the boundary between the small bowel or the seminal vesicle and the bladder was unclear. For patients with head and neck cancer, no significant differences were observed between the two models for almost all OARs, except small delineations such as the optic chiasm and optic nerve. The DSC tended to be lower when the HD and the MDA were smaller in small volume delineations.\nIn terms of efficiency, the processing time for head and neck cancers was much shorter than manual delineation. While quantitative evaluation with AI-based segmentation was significantly more accurate than atlas-based for prostate cancer, there was no significant difference for head and neck cancer. According to the results of visual evaluation, less necessity of manual correction in AI-based segmentation indicates that the segmentation efficiency of AI-based model is higher than that of atlas-based model. The effectiveness of the AI-based model can be expected to improve the segmentation efficiency and to significantly shorten the delineation time.", "A deep learning artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm has been demonstrated to outperform embryologists in identifying euploid embryos destined to implant with an accuracy of 75.3% (1). Our aim was to evaluate the performance of highly trained embryologists in selecting top quality day 5 euploid blastocysts with and without the aid of a deep learning algorithm.\nA non-overlapping series of 200 sets of day 5 euploid embryo images with known implantation outcomes was distributed to 17 highly trained embryologists. One embryo in each set was known to have implanted and one failed implantation. They were asked to select which embryo to transfer from each set. The same 200 sets of embryos, with indication of which embryo in each set had been identified by the algorithm as more likely to implant was then distributed. Chi-squared, t-test, and receiver operating curves were performed to compare the embryologist performeance with and without AI.\nFourteen embryologists completed both assessments. Embryologists provided with AI results selected successfully implanted embryos in 73.6% of cases compared to 65.5% for those selected using visual assessments alone (p\u2009<\u20090.001). All embryologists improved in their ability to select embryos with the aid of the AI algorithm with a mean percent improvement of 11.1% (range 1.4% to 15.5%). There were no differences in degree of improvement by embryologist level of experience (junior, intermediate, senior).\nThe incorporation of an AI framework for blastocyst selection enhanced the performance of trained embryologists in identifying PGT-A euploid embryos destined to implant.", "The world is living the fourth industrial revolution, marked by the increasing intelligence and automation of manufacturing systems. Nevertheless, there are types of tasks that are too complex or too expensive to be fully automated, it would be more efficient if the machines were able to work with the human, not only by sharing the same workspace but also as useful collaborators. A possible solution to that problem is on human-robot interaction systems, understanding the applications where they can be helpful to implement and what are the challenges they face. This work proposes the development of an industrial prototype of a human-machine interaction system through Augmented Reality, in which the objective is to enable an industrial operator without any programming experience to program a robot. The system itself is divided into two different parts: the tracking system, which records the operator's hand movement, and the translator system, which writes the program to be sent to the robot that will execute the task. To demonstrate the concept, the user drew geometric figures, and the robot was able to replicate the operator's path recorded.", "The healthcare sector is considered to be one of the largest and fast-growing industries in the world. Innovations and novel approaches have always remained the prime aims in order to bring massive development. Before the emergence of technology, the healthcare sector was dependent on manpower, which was time-consuming and less accurate with lack of efficiency. With the recent advancements in machine learning, the condition has been steadily revolutionizing. Artificial intelligence (AI) lies in the computer science department, which stresses on the intelligent machines' creation, that work and react just like human beings. Currently, the applications of AI have been expanding into those fields, which was once thought to be the only domain of human expertise such as healthcare sector. In this review, we have shed light on the present usage of AI in the healthcare sector, such as its working, and the way this system is being implemented in different domains, such as drug discovery, diagnosis of diseases, clinical trials, remote patient monitoring, and nanotechnology. We have also briefly touched upon its applications in other sectors as well. The public opinions have also been analyzed and discussed along with the future prospects. We have discussed the merits, and the other side of AI, i.e. the disadvantages in the last part of the manuscript.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) can support clinical decisions and provide quality assurance for images. Although ultrasonography is commonly used in the field of obstetrics and gynecology, the use of AI is still in a stage of infancy. Nevertheless, in repetitive ultrasound examinations, such as those involving automatic positioning and identification of fetal structures, prediction of gestational age (GA), and real-time image quality assurance, AI has great potential. To realize its application, it is necessary to promote interdisciplinary communication between AI developers and sonographers. In this review, we outlined the benefits of AI technology in obstetric ultrasound diagnosis by optimizing image acquisition, quantification, segmentation, and location identification, which can be helpful for obstetric ultrasound diagnosis in different periods of pregnancy.", "Diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) is one of the most serious and alarming diabetic complications, which often leads to high amputation rates in diabetic patients. Machine learning is a part of the field of artificial intelligence, which can automatically learn models from data and better inform clinical decision-making. We aimed to develop an accurate and explainable prediction model to estimate the risk of in-hospital amputation in patients with DFU. A total of 618 hospitalised patients with DFU were included in this study. The patients were divided into non-amputation, minor amputation or major amputation group. Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) and 5-fold cross-validation tools were used to construct a multi-class classification model to predict the three outcomes of interest. In addition, we used the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) algorithm to interpret the predictions of the model. Our area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUC) demonstrated a 0.90, 0.85 and 0.86 predictive ability for non-amputation, minor amputation and major amputation outcomes, respectively. Taken together, our data demonstrated that the developed explainable machine learning model provided accurate estimates of the amputation rate in patients with DFU during hospitalisation. Besides, the model could inform individualised analyses of the patients' risk factors.", "Procedures and models of computerized data analysis are becoming researchers' and practitioners' thinking partners by transforming the reasoning underlying biomedicine. Complexity theory, Network analysis and Artificial Intelligence are already approaching this discipline, intending to provide support for patient's diagnosis, prognosis and treatments. At the same time, due to the sparsity, noisiness and time-dependency of medical data, such procedures are raising many unprecedented problems related to the mismatch between the human mind's reasoning and the outputs of computational models. Thanks to these computational, non-anthropocentric models, a patient's clinical situation can be elucidated in the orthodontic discipline, and the growth outcome can be approximated. However, to have confidence in these procedures, orthodontists should be warned of the related benefits and risks. Here we want to present how these innovative approaches can derive better patients' characterization, also offering a different point of view about patient's classification, prognosis and treatment.", "Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death and ranks third worldwide in diagnosed malignant pathologies (1.36 million new cases annually). An increase in the diversity of treatment options as well as a rising population require novel diagnostic tools. Current diagnostics involve critical human thinking, but the decisional process loses accuracy due to the increased number of modulatory factors involved. The proposed computer-aided diagnosis system analyses each colonoscopy and provides predictions that will help the clinician to make the right decisions. Artificial intelligence is included in the system both offline and online image processing tools. Aiming to improve the diagnostic process of colon cancer patients, an application was built that allows the easiest and most intuitive interaction between medical staff and the proposed diagnosis system. The developed tool uses two networks. The first, a convolutional neural network, is capable of classifying eight classes of tissue with a sensitivity of 98.13% and an F1 score of 98.14%, while the second network, based on semantic segmentation, can identify the malignant areas with a Jaccard index of 75.18%.

The reliable assessment and robotic support of the upper limb joints provided by the presented elbow exoskeleton are important clinical goals in early rehabilitation after stroke and other neurological disorders. This allows for not only the support of activities of daily living, but also prevention of the progression neuromuscular pathology through proactive physiotherapy toward functional recovery. The prices of plastics are rising very quickly, as is their consumption, so it makes sense to optimize three dimensional (3D) printing procedures through, for example, improved artificial intelligence-based (AI-based) design or injection simulation, which reduces the use of filament, saves material, reduces waste, and reduces environmental impact. The time and cost savings will not reduce the high quality of the products and can provide a competitive advantage, especially in the case of thinly designed mass products. AI-based optimization allows for one free print after every 6.67 prints (i.e., from materials that were previously wasted).", "Neural systems can selectively filter and memorize spatiotemporal information, thus enabling high-efficient information processing. Emulating such an exquisite biological process in electronic devices is of fundamental importance for developing neuromorphic architectures with efficient in situ edge/parallel computing, and probabilistic inference. Here a novel multifunctional memristor is proposed and demonstrated based on metalloporphyrin/oxide hybrid heterojunction, in which the metalloporphyrin layer allows for dual electronic/ionic transport. Benefiting from the coordination-assisted ionic diffusion, the device exhibits smooth, gradual conductive transitions. It is shown that the memristive characteristics of this hybrid system can be modulated by altering the metal center for desired metal-oxygen bonding energy and oxygen ions migration dynamics. The spike voltage-dependent plasticity stemming from the local/extended movement of oxygen ions under low/high voltage is identified, which permits potentiation and depression under unipolar different positive voltages. As a proof-of-concept demonstration, memristive arrays are further built to emulate the signal filtering function of the biological visual system. This work demonstrates the ionic intelligence feature of metalloporphyrin and paves the way for implementing efficient neural-signal analysis in neuromorphic hardware.", "Diagnosis of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is complicated and requires substantial expertise and experience. This study aimed to develop an artificial intelligence (AI) system for detecting superficial ESCC under multiple endoscopic imaging modalities.\nEndoscopic images were retrospectively collected from West China Hospital, Sichuan University as a training dataset and an independent internal validation dataset. Images from other four hospitals were used as an external validation dataset. The AI system was compared with 11 experienced endoscopists. Furthermore, videos were collected to assess the performance of the AI system.\nA total of 53\u00a0933 images from 2621 patients and 142 videos from 19 patients were used to develop and validate the AI system. In the internal and external validation datasets, the performance of the AI system under all or different endoscopic imaging modalities was satisfactory, with sensitivity of 92.5-99.7%, specificity of 78.5-89.0%, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curves of 0.906-0.989.

Regarding superficial ESCC confined to the epithelium, the AI system was more sensitive than experienced endoscopists on white-light imaging (90.8% vs 82.5%, P\u00a0=\u00a00.022). Moreover, the AI system exhibited good performance in videos, with sensitivity of 89.5-100% and specificity of 73.7-89.5%.\nWe developed an AI system that showed comparable performance with experienced endoscopists in detecting superficial ESCC under multiple endoscopic imaging modalities and might provide valuable support for inexperienced endoscopists, despite requiring further evaluation.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) deep learning (DL) has been shown to have significant potential for eye disease detection and screening on retinal photographs in different clinical settings, particular in primary care. However, an automated pre-diagnosis image assessment is essential to streamline the application of the developed AI-DL algorithms. In this study, we developed and validated a DL-based pre-diagnosis assessment module for retinal photographs, targeting image quality (gradable vs. ungradable), field of view (macula-centered vs. optic-disc-centered), and laterality of the eye (right vs. left).\nA total of 21,348 retinal photographs from 1914 subjects from various clinical settings in Hong Kong, Singapore, and the United Kingdom were used for training, internal validation, and external testing for the DL module, developed by two DL-based algorithms (EfficientNet-B0 and MobileNet-V2).\nFor image-quality assessment, the pre-diagnosis module achieved area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) values of 0.975, 0.999, and 0.987 in the internal validation dataset and the two external testing datasets, respectively. For field-of-view assessment, the module had an AUROC value of 1.000 in all of the datasets.

Health coaching has been shown to be an effective approach for improving behavioral changes in self-management. Health coaching combined with telehealth technology has the potential to improve the overall quality of and access to health services.\nThis protocol outlines the study design for implementing the Artificial Intelligence for Diabetes Management (AI4DM) intervention. The protocol will assess the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of the AI4DM telehealth platform for people with disabilities.\nThe AI4DM study is a 2-arm randomized controlled trial for evaluating the delivery of a 12-month intervention, which will involve telecoaching, diabetes educational content, and technology access, to 90 individuals with diabetes and physical disabilities. The hypothesis is that this pilot project is feasible and acceptable for adults with permanently impaired mobility and type 2 diabetes. We also hypothesize that adults in the AI4DM intervention groups will have significantly better glycemic control (glycated hemoglobin) and psychosocial and psychological measures than the attention control group at the 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-ups.\nThe AI4DM study was approved by the university's institutional review board, and recruitment and enrollment will begin in October 2021.\nThe AI4DM study will improve our understanding of the feasibility and efficacy of a web-based diabetes self-management program for people with disabilities.

The outcomes and benefits of the whole slide imaging are beyond the scope of traditional microscopy, which the pathologists were using for decades. COVID-19 pandemic has further highlighted the importance of digital pathology as it offers the pathologists to work from their place of comfort and bridges the gap of physical barriers. In addition to the many advantages, there are certain limitations and challenges, which have to be overcomed particularly in the developing world. The major issue is the cost of scanners and technical support and training of staff. However, despite all these problems and challenges that exist, these can be resolved with the passage of time, where the role of world leader organisations will be of great importance in resolving these challenges.

The existing process of examining multiple incidents is based on inductive thematic analysis and forming the remedial actions is based on barrier analysis of intelligence on potential solutions. However, no formal systems models evaluated in this study have been used.\nAcciMap and Systems Engineering Initiative for Patient Safety (SEIPS) were selected, applied and evaluated to the analysis of two different sets of patient safety incidents: (i) incidents concerning ingestion of superabsorbent polymer granules and (ii) incidents concerning the interruption in use of High Nasal Flow Oxygen. The first set was analysed by the first author and the utility and usability were reflected. The second set was analysed collectively by a purposeful sample of patient safety team members, who create the National Patient Safety Alerts from incident-level data and information. All of them attended a 30-min video-based training and a 1.5\u2009h case-based online workshop. Post-workshop individual interviews were conducted to evaluate their perceived utility and usability of each model.\nThe patient safety team showed overwhelming support for the utility of the system models as a 'framework' that provides a systematic, structured way of looking at an issue and examining the causes, whilst also sharing concerns regarding their usability. AcciMap was viewed useful particularly in providing a visual comprehensive overview of the issue but considered chaotic by some participants due to many arrows between factors. SEIPS was perceived easier to understand due to the familiarity of the structure (Donbedian's model), but the non-hierarchical format of SEIPS was considered less useful.\nThe participants of the study agreed with the high level of utility of both models for their unique strengths, but shared some concern for the usability of them in terms of complexity and further training/coaching time would be required to adopt these models in their daily practices. It is recommended that the gap between HF/E practitioners and patient safety practitioners can be narrowed by strengthening education, and coaching and mentoring relationships between the two groups, led by the increasing number of healthcare practitioners who embrace their membership to HF/E practice.", "The aim of the study was to analyze differences in intelligence, academic competences, and academic achievement by gender and academic course in sports science university students. To reach the study aim we analyzed in 267 (226 males and 41 females) first and last year students' degree the variables of intelligence (Reasoning scale of the Primary Mental Abilities Test), academic achievement and self-perception of 40 academic competences (30 general competences and 10 specific competences). We found how last year degree students presented higher general and specific competences than first year students, not presenting differences in intelligence and academic achievement. Female students presented higher academic achievement and higher values in some general and specific competences but not in intelligence.", "Quantifying the similarity between artificial neural networks (ANNs) and their biological counterparts is an important step toward building more brain-like artificial intelligence systems. Recent efforts in this direction use neural predictivity, or the ability to predict the responses of a biological brain given the information in an ANN (such as its internal activations), when both are presented with the same stimulus. We propose a new approach to quantifying neural predictivity by explicitly mapping the activations of an ANN to brain responses with a non-linear function, and measuring the error between the predicted and actual brain responses. Further, we propose to use a neural network to approximate this mapping function by training it on a set of neural recordings. The proposed method was implemented within the TensorFlow framework and evaluated on a suite of 8 state-of-the-art image recognition ANNs. Our experiments suggest that the use of a non-linear mapping function leads to higher neural predictivity. Our findings also reaffirm the observation that the latest advances in classification performance of image recognition ANNs are not matched by improvements in their neural predictivity. Finally, we examine the impact of pruning, a widely used ANN optimization, on neural predictivity, and demonstrate that network sparsity leads to higher neural predictivity.", "High-resolution liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC--MS-MS)-based machine learning models are constructed to address the analytical challenge of identifying unknown controlled substances and new psychoactive substances (NPSs). Using a training set composed of 770 LC-MS-MS barcode spectra (with binary entries 0 or 1) obtained generally by high-resolution mass spectrometers, three classification machine learning models were generated and evaluated. The three models are artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine (SVM) and k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) models. In these models, controlled substances and NPSs were classified into 13 subgroups (benzylpiperazine, opiate, benzodiazepine, amphetamine, cocaine, methcathinone, classical cannabinoid, fentanyl, 2C series, indazole carbonyl compound, indole carbonyl compound, phencyclidine and others). Using 193 LC-MS-MS barcode spectra as an external test set, accuracy of the ANN, SVM and k-NN models were evaluated as 72.5%, 90.0% and 94.3%, respectively. Also, the hybrid similarity search (HSS) algorithm was evaluated to examine whether this algorithm can successfully identify unknown controlled substances and NPSs whose data are unavailable in the database. When only 24 representative LC-MS-MS spectra of controlled substances and NPSs were selectively included in the database, it was found that HSS can successfully identify compounds with high reliability. The machine learning models and HSS algorithms are incorporated into our home-coded artificial intelligence screener for narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances standalone software that is equipped with a graphic user interface. The use of this software allows unknown controlled substances and NPSs to be identified in a convenient manner.", "The primary aim of this study was to examine relative inter-subtest variability, or scatter, on the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Fourth Edition (WAIS-IV) in a clinical sample of patients referred for neuropsychological evaluation and compare the findings to corresponding data from the scale's standardization sample.\nParticipants were 638 individuals diagnosed primarily with neurological, psychiatric, or neurodevelopmental disorders who completed the 10 core subtests of the WAIS-IV as part of a comprehensive assessment battery.\nMean participant scores on the WAIS-IV Full Scale IQ and all index composites were within the average range, overall, but were significantly below those of the standardization sample. The correlation between scatter range and highest subtest scaled score was significant, r = .65, indicating a greater degree of subtest scaled score variability in participants with higher than average peak subtest scaled scores than participants with average or below peak subtest scaled scores. Mean variability by highest subtest scaled score was, in most cases, larger in this clinical sample relative to the scale's standardization sample. Exploratory secondary analyses also revealed specific differences in relative scatter based on diagnostic group classification.\nSubtest scatter on the WAIS-IV is common among both healthy individuals and clinical patients. Although somewhat higher in this investigation's clinical sample, the significance of this finding generally appears to be of nominal value during interpretation of individual cases but may have some utility in formulating hypotheses when considered in conjunction with reliability data and other approaches for analyzing test scores. High scatter is not pathognomonic of abnormality, and at least some degree of caution is warranted when interpreting subtest scaled score differences on the WAIS-IV.", "Ongoing improvements in AI, particularly concerning deep learning techniques, are assisting to identify, classify, and quantify patterns in clinical images. Deep learning is the quickest developing field in artificial intelligence and is effectively utilized lately in numerous areas, including medication. A brief outline is given on studies carried out on the region of application: neuro, brain, retinal, pneumonic, computerized pathology, bosom, heart, breast, bone, stomach, and musculoskeletal. For information exploration, knowledge deployment, and knowledge-based prediction, deep learning networks can be successfully applied to big data. In the field of medical image processing methods and analysis, fundamental information and state-of-the-art approaches with deep learning are presented in this paper. The primary goals of this paper are to present research on medical image processing as well as to define and implement the key guidelines that are identified and addressed.", "The 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic had far-reaching consequences beyond the spread of the disease and efforts to cure it. Today, it is obvious that the pandemic devastated key sectors ranging from health to economy, culture, and education. As far as education is concerned, one direct result of the spread of the pandemic was the resort to suspending traditional in-person classroom courses and relying on remote learning and homeschooling instead, by exploiting e-learning technologies, but many challenges are faced by these technologies. Most of these challenges are centered around the efficiency of these delivery methods, interactivity, and knowledge testing. These issues raise the need to develop an advanced smart educational system that assists home-schooled students, provides teachers with a range of smart new tools, and enable a dynamic and interactive e-learning experience. Technologies like the Internet of things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI), including cognitive models and context-awareness, can be a driving force in the future of e-learning, opening many opportunities to overcome the limitation of the existing remote learning systems and provide an efficient reliable augmented learning experience. Furthermore, virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR), introduced in education as a way for asynchronous learning, can be a second driving force of future synchronous learning. The teacher and students can see each other in a virtual class even if they are geographically spread in a city, a country, or the globe. The main goal of this work is to design and provide a model supporting intelligent teaching assisting and engaging e-learning activity. This paper presents a new model, ViRICTA, an intelligent system, proposing an end-to-end solution with a stack technology integrating the Internet of things and artificial intelligence. The designed system aims to enable a valuable learning experience, providing an efficient, interactive, and proactive context-aware learning smart services.", "Artificial intelligence technology is becoming more prevalent in health care as a tool to improve practice patterns and patient outcomes. This study assessed ability of a commercialized artificial intelligence (AI) mobile application to identify and improve bodyweight squat form in adult participants when compared to a physical therapist (PT). Participants randomized to AI group (n\u2009=\u200915) performed 3 squat sets: 10 unassisted control squats, 10 squats with performance feedback from AI, and 10 additional unassisted test squats. Participants randomized to PT group (n\u2009=\u200915) also performed 3 identical sets, but instead received performance feedback from PT. AI group intervention did not differ from PT group (log ratio of two odds ratios\u2009=\u2009\u2009-\u20090.462, 95% confidence interval (CI) (-\u20091.394, 0.471), p\u2009=\u20090.332).

There was no statistically significant association between group allocation and improved squat performance. Current AI had satisfactory ability to identify correct squat form and limited ability to identify incorrect squat form, which reduced diagnostic capabilities.Trial Registration NCT04624594, 12/11/2020, retrospectively registered.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) is making computer systems capable of executing human brain tasks in many fields in all aspects of daily life. The enhancement in information and communications technology (ICT) has indisputably improved the quality of people's lives around the globe. Especially, ICT has led to a very needy and tremendous improvement in the health sector which is commonly known as electronic health (eHealth) and medical health (mHealth). Deep machine learning and AI approaches are commonly presented in many applications using big data, which consists of all relevant data about the medical health and diseases which a model can access at the time of execution or diagnosis of diseases. For example, cardiovascular imaging has now accurate imaging combined with big data from the eHealth record and pathology to better characterize the disease and personalized therapy. In clinical work and imaging, cancer care is getting improved by knowing the tumor biology and helping in the implementation of precision medicine. The Markov model is used to extract new approaches for leveraging cancer. In this paper, we have reviewed existing research relevant to eHealth and mHealth where various models are discussed which uses big data for the diagnosis and healthcare system. This paper summarizes the recent promising applications of AI and big data in medical health and electronic health, which have potentially added value to diagnosis and patient care.", "COVID-19 is a quickly spreading over 10 million persons globally. The overall number of infected patients worldwide is estimated to be around 133,381,413 people. Infection rate is being increased on daily basis. It has also caused a devastating effect on the world economy and public health. Early stage detection of this disease is mandatory to reduce the mortality rate. Artificial intelligence performs a vital role for COVID-19 detection at an initial stage using chest radiographs. The proposed methods comprise of the two phases. Deep features (DFs) are derived from its last fully connected layers of pre-trained models like AlexNet and MobileNet in phase-I. Later these feature vectors are fused serially. Best features are selected through feature selection method of PCA and passed to the SVM and KNN for classification. In phase-II, quantum transfer learning model is utilized, in which a pre-trained ResNet-18 model is applied for DF collection and then these features are supplied as an input to the 4-qubit quantum circuit for model training with the tuned hyperparameters. The proposed technique is evaluated on two publicly available x-ray imaging datasets. The proposed methodology achieved an accuracy index of 99.0% with three classes including corona virus-positive images, normal images, and pneumonia radiographs. In comparison to other recently published work, the experimental findings show that the proposed approach outperforms it.", "In the last decades, non-invasive and portable neuroimaging techniques, such as functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), have allowed researchers to study the mechanisms underlying the functional cognitive development of the human brain, thus furthering the potential of Developmental Cognitive Neuroscience (DCN). However, the traditional paradigms used for the analysis of infant fNIRS data are still quite limited. Here, we introduce a multivariate pattern analysis for fNIRS data, xMVPA, that is powered by eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI). The proposed approach is exemplified in a study that investigates visual and auditory processing in six-month-old infants. xMVPA not only identified patterns of cortical interactions, which confirmed the existent literature; in the form of conceptual linguistic representations, it also provided evidence for brain networks engaged in the processing of visual and auditory stimuli that were previously overlooked by other methods, while demonstrating similar statistical performance.", "Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is an allergic inflammatory condition characterized by eosinophil accumulation in the esophageal mucosa. EoE diagnosis includes a manual assessment of eosinophil levels in mucosal biopsies-a time-consuming, laborious task that is difficult to standardize. One of the main challenges in automating this process, like many other biopsy-based diagnostics, is detecting features that are small relative to the size of the biopsy.\nIn this work, we utilized hematoxylin- and eosin-stained slides from esophageal biopsies from patients with active EoE and control subjects to develop a platform based on a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) that can classify esophageal biopsies with an accuracy of 85%, sensitivity of 82.5%, and specificity of 87%. Moreover, by combining several downscaling and cropping strategies, we show that some of the features contributing to the correct classification are global rather than specific, local features.\nWe report the ability of artificial intelligence to identify EoE using computer vision analysis of esophageal biopsy slides. Further, the DCNN features associated with EoE are based on not only local eosinophils but also global histologic changes. Our approach can be used for other conditions that rely on biopsy-based histologic diagnostics.", "Harmonized language is critical for helping researchers to find data, collecting scientific data to facilitate comparison, and performing pooled and meta-analyses. Using standard terms to link data to knowledge systems facilitates knowledge-driven analysis, allows for the use of biomedical knowledge bases for scientific interpretation and hypothesis generation, and increasingly supports artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning. Due to the breadth of environmental health sciences (EHS) research and the continuous evolution in scientific methods, the gaps in standard terminologies, vocabularies, ontologies, and related tools hamper the capabilities to address large-scale, complex EHS research questions that require the integration of disparate data and knowledge sources. The results of prior workshops to advance a harmonized environmental health language demonstrate that future efforts should be sustained and grounded in scientific need. We describe a community initiative whose mission was to advance integrative environmental health sciences research via the development and adoption of a harmonized language. The products, outcomes, and recommendations developed and endorsed by this community are expected to enhance data collection and management efforts for NIEHS and the EHS community, making data more findable and interoperable. This initiative will provide a community of practice space to exchange information and expertise, be a coordination hub for identifying and prioritizing activities, and a collaboration platform for the development and adoption of semantic solutions. We encourage anyone interested in advancing this mission to engage in this community.", "By targeting invasive organisms, antibiotics insert themselves into the ancient struggle of the host-pathogen evolutionary arms race. As pathogens evolve tactics for evading antibiotics, therapies decline in efficacy and must be replaced, distinguishing antibiotics from most other forms of drug development. Together with a slow and expensive antibiotic development pipeline, the proliferation of drug-resistant pathogens drives urgent interest in computational methods that promise to expedite candidate discovery. Strides in artificial intelligence (AI) have encouraged its application to multiple dimensions of computer-aided drug design, with increasing application to antibiotic discovery. This review describes AI-facilitated advances in the discovery of both small molecule antibiotics and antimicrobial peptides. Beyond the essential prediction of antimicrobial activity, emphasis is also given to antimicrobial compound representation, determination of drug-likeness traits, antimicrobial resistance, and de novo molecular design. Given the urgency of the antimicrobial resistance crisis, we analyze uptake of open science best practices in AI-driven antibiotic discovery and argue for openness and reproducibility as a means of accelerating preclinical research. Finally, trends in the literature and areas for future inquiry are discussed, as artificially intelligent enhancements to drug discovery at large offer many opportunities for future applications in antibiotic development.", "The COVID-19 global pandemic has wreaked havoc on every aspect of our lives. More specifically, healthcare systems were greatly stretched to their limits and beyond. Advances in artificial intelligence have enabled the implementation of sophisticated applications that can meet clinical accuracy requirements. In this study, customized and pre-trained deep learning models based on convolutional neural networks were used to detect pneumonia caused by COVID-19 respiratory complications. Chest X-ray images from 368 confirmed COVID-19 patients were collected locally. In addition, data from three publicly available datasets were used. The performance was evaluated in four ways. First, the public dataset was used for training and testing. Second, data from the local and public sources were combined and used to train and test the models. Third, the public dataset was used to train the model and the local data were used for testing only. This approach adds greater credibility to the detection models and tests their ability to generalize to new data without overfitting the model to specific samples. Fourth, the combined data were used for training and the local dataset was used for testing. The results show a high detection accuracy of 98.7% with the combined dataset, and most models handled new data with an insignificant drop in accuracy.", "Monitoring and assessment of groundwater quality (GWQ) as an important freshwater source for drinking purposes in urban and rural regions of developing countries due to rapidly increasing contamination is one of the concerns of water managers. Therefore, developing an efficient intelligent model for analyzing GWQ could help hydro-environmental engineers for sustainable water supply. The current research investigated the applicability of a novel nature-inspired optimization algorithm hybridized with multi-layer perceptron artificial neural network based on gray wolf optimization (GWO) for estimating dissolved oxygen (DO) total dissolved solid (TDS) and turbidity parameters at Asadabad Plain, Iran, and results are compared with the stand-alone multi-layer perceptron artificial neural network (MLPANN), generalized regression neural network (GRNN), and multiple linear regression (MLR) approaches. Evaluation of performance of models is carried out using various statistical indices like relative root mean square error, Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency, and correlation coefficient. Based on the results obtained, it is found that the hybrid GWO-MLPANN is a beneficial GWQ forecasting tool in accordance to high performance accuracy. Also, the study found that the superiority of the applied meta-heuristic algorithm (GWO) in improving the performance accuracy of the stand-alone artificial intelligence techniques in modeling the GWQ parameters.", "Human action recognition in videos has become a popular research area in artificial intelligence (AI) technology. In the past few years, this research has accelerated in areas such as sports, daily activities, kitchen activities, etc., due to developments in the benchmarks proposed for human action recognition datasets in these areas. However, there is little research in the benchmarking datasets for human activity recognition in educational environments. Therefore, we developed a dataset of teacher and student activities to expand the research in the education domain. This paper proposes a new dataset, called EduNet, for a novel approach towards developing human action recognition datasets in classroom environments. EduNet has 20 action classes, containing around 7851 manually annotated clips extracted from YouTube videos, and recorded in an actual classroom environment. Each action category has a minimum of 200 clips, and the total duration is approximately 12 h. To the best of our knowledge, EduNet is the first dataset specially prepared for classroom monitoring for both teacher and student activities. It is also a challenging dataset of actions as it has many clips (and due to the unconstrained nature of the clips). We compared the performance of the EduNet dataset with benchmark video datasets UCF101 and HMDB51 on a standard I3D-ResNet-50 model, which resulted in 72.3% accuracy. The development of a new benchmark dataset for the education domain will benefit future research concerning classroom monitoring systems. The EduNet dataset is a collection of classroom activities from 1 to 12 standard schools.", "As the COVID-19 pandemic has largely increased the utilization of telehealth, mobile mental health technologies - such as smartphone apps,\u00a0vir-tual reality, chatbots, and social media - have also gained attention. These digital health technologies offer the potential of accessible and scalable interventions that can augment traditional care. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive update on the overall field of digital psychiatry, covering three areas. First, we outline the relevance of recent technological advances to mental health research and care, by detailing how smartphones, social media, artificial intelligence and virtual reality present new opportunities for \"digital phenotyping\" and remote intervention. Second, we review the current evidence for the use of these new technological approaches across different mental health contexts, covering their emerging efficacy in self-management of psychological well-being and early intervention, along with more nascent research supporting their use in clinical management of long-term psychiatric conditions - including major depression; anxiety, bipolar and psychotic disorders; and eating and substance use disorders - as well as in child and adolescent mental health care. Third, we discuss the most pressing challenges and opportunities towards real-world implementation, using the Integrated Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services (i-PARIHS) framework to explain how the innovations themselves, the recipients of these innovations, and the context surrounding innovations all must be considered to facilitate their adoption and use in mental health care systems. We conclude that the new technological capabilities of smartphones, artificial intelligence, social media and virtual reality are already changing mental health care in unforeseen and exciting ways, each accompanied by an early but promising evidence base. We point out that further efforts towards strengthening implementation are needed, and detail the key issues at the patient, provider and policy levels which must now be addressed for digital health technologies to truly improve mental health research and treatment in the future.", "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most commonly seen brain ailments worldwide. Therefore, many researches have been presented about AD detection and cure. In addition, machine learning models have also been proposed to detect AD promptly.\nIn this work, a new brain image dataset was collected. This dataset contains two categories, and these categories are healthy and AD. This dataset was collected from 1070 subjects. This work presents an automatic AD detection model to detect AD using brain images automatically. The presented model is called a feed-forward local phase quantization network (LPQNet). LPQNet consists of (i) multilevel feature generation based on LPQ and average pooling, (ii) feature selection using neighborhood component analysis (NCA), and (iii) classification phases. The prime objective of the presented LPQNet is to reach high accuracy with low computational complexity. LPQNet generates features on six levels. Therefore, 256\u00a0\u00d7\u00a06\u00a0=\u00a01536 features are generated from an image, and the most important 256 out 1536 features are selected. The selected 256 features are classified on the conventional classifiers to denote the classification capability of the generated and selected features by LPQNet.\nThe presented LPQNet was tested on three image datasets to demonstrate the universal classification ability of the LPQNet. The proposed LPQNet attained 99.68%, 100%, and 99.64% classification accuracy on the collected AD image dataset, the Harvard Brain Atlas AD dataset, and the Kaggle AD dataset. Moreover, LPQNet attained 99.62% accuracy on the Kaggle AD dataset using four classes.\nMoreover, the calculated results from LPQNet are compared to other automatic AD detection models. Comparisons, results, and findings clearly denote the superiority of the presented model. In addition, a new intelligent AD detector application can be developed for use in magnetic resonance (MR) and computed tomography (CT) devices. By using the developed automated AD detector, new generation intelligence MR and CT devices can be developed.", "Skin cancer is one of the most common types of cancers that is sometimes difficult for doctors and experts to diagnose. The noninvasive dermatoscopic method is a popular method for observing and diagnosing skin cancer. Because this method is based on ocular inference, the skin cancer diagnosis by the dermatologists is difficult, especially in the early stages of the disease. Artificial intelligence is a proper complementary tool that can be used alongside the experts to increase the accuracy of the diagnosis. In the present study, a new computer-aided method has been introduced for the diagnosis of the skin cancer. The method is designed based on combination of deep learning and a newly introduced metaheuristic algorithm, namely, Wildebeest Herd Optimization (WHO) Algorithm. The method uses an Inception convolutional neural network for the initial features' extraction. Afterward, the WHO algorithm has been employed for selecting the useful features to decrease the analysis time complexity. The method is then performed to an ISIC-2008 skin cancer dataset. Final results of the feature selection based on the proposed WHO are compared with three other algorithms, and the results have indicated good results for the system. Finally, the total diagnosis system has been compared with five other methods to indicate its effectiveness against the studied methods. Final results showed that the proposed method has the best results than the comparative methods.", "Artificial intelligence-based tools designed to assist in the diagnosis of lymphoid neoplasms remain limited. The development of such tools can add value as a diagnostic aid in the evaluation of tissue samples involved by lymphoma. A common diagnostic question is the determination of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) progression to accelerated CLL (aCLL) or transformation to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (Richter transformation; RT) in patients who develop progressive disease. The morphologic assessment of CLL, aCLL, and RT can be diagnostically challenging. Using established diagnostic criteria of CLL progression/transformation, we designed four artificial intelligence-constructed biomarkers based on cytologic (nuclear size and nuclear intensity) and architectural (cellular density and cell to nearest-neighbor distance) features. We analyzed the predictive value of implementing these biomarkers individually and then in an iterative sequential manner to distinguish tissue samples with CLL, aCLL, and RT. Our model, based on these four morphologic biomarker attributes, achieved a robust analytic accuracy. This study suggests that biomarkers identified using artificial intelligence-based tools can be used to assist in the diagnostic evaluation of tissue samples from patients with CLL who develop aggressive disease features. \u00a9 2021 The Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.

It has been used to treat impotence, spermatorrhea, anemia and insomnia. Therefore, its characteristic components and neuronal modulating effects were studied.\nTo investigate the elimination of A\u03b2-induced toxicity by CE and to elucidate the molecular mechanisms involving BDNF, FGF2, and their related signaling axis, and the RIP1-driven inflammatory pathway.\nWe established A\u03b2-induced toxicity models in cultured neurons and ICR mice, respectively. MWM and fear conditioning tests were performed for behavioral analysis of cognitive functions in mice. Western blot was used to investigate the levels of BDNF, FGF2, and their downstream effector TrkB/Akt/Bcl-2, as well as the RIP1-driven RIP1/RIP3/MLKL pathway. Immunofluorescence assay is used to examine the status of glial cells.\nCE abrogated A\u03b2 toxicity and inhibited apoptosis in cultured neurons, mainly by regulating the BDNF, FGF2, and TrkB/Akt signaling pathways as well as RIP1-driven inflammation and necroptosis. Similarly, mice injected intracerebrally with A\u03b2 exhibited cognitive deficits and had elevated oxidative stress and inflammatory factors detected in their serum and brain. However, CE-treated mice showed recovery of cognitive abilities and quelled levels of oxidative stress and inflammatory factors. Moreover, A\u03b2 toxicity led to a reduction in BDNF, FGF2, and related signaling regulators in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, accompanied by activation of RIP1-driven inflammatory signaling pathways, and a reduction in TBK1 and Bcl-2. However, CE restored the levels of BDNF, FGF2, and TrkB/Akt signaling pathway, while inhibiting RIP1-induced RIP1/RIP3/MLKL pathway, thereby antagonizing apoptosis and maintaining neuronal activity.\nCE effectively eliminated the toxicity of A\u03b2 in cultured neurons and mouse models, which holds promise for drug development.", "This paper explains the process of developing a scenario involving the use of a robotic platform to enhance the work experience of disabled employees. We outline the challenges involved in revealing the potential unintended consequences of introducing elements of Artificial Intelligence, automation, and robotics into a socially and ethically complex and potentially fragile scenario, and the practical challenges involved in giving a voice to vulnerable users throughout the design process. While an ideal case scenario would involve the disabled employees as much as possible directly in the design process, this can, realistically, be a challenge. In this paper, we detail a methodological and analytic approach that is centered around ethnography and design fictions. It is designed to provide a deeper understanding of all the stakeholders involved in the scenario while encouraging ethical reflection. Based on our findings, we argue that, while it is relatively easy to adopt an a priori ethical stance through notions such as inclusivity and accessibility, there are risks involved in making such a priori prescriptions with respect to the perspectives of different stakeholders in an applied research project. More specifically, we highlight the importance of understanding the broad organizational and bureaucratic characteristics of a business or workplace when devising HRI scenarios and tasks, and of considering elements such as business models, operating philosophy, and organizational hierarchies in the design process.", "For patients with advanced cancer, timely referral to palliative care (PC) services can ensure that end-of-life care aligns with their preferences and goals. Overestimation of life expectancy may result in underutilization of PC services, counterproductive treatment measures, and reduced quality of life for patients. We assessed the impact of a commercially available augmented intelligence (AI) tool to predict 30-day mortality risk on PC service utilization in a real-world setting.\nPatients within a large hematology-oncology practice were scored weekly between June 2018 and October 2019 with an AI tool to generate insights into short-term mortality risk. Patients identified by the tool as being at high or medium risk were assessed for a supportive care visit and further referred as appropriate. Average monthly rates of PC and hospice referrals were calculated 5 months predeployment and 17 months postdeployment of the tool in the practice.\nThe mean rate of PC consults increased from 17.3 to 29.1 per 1,000 patients per month (PPM) pre- and postdeployment, whereas the mean rate of hospice referrals increased from 0.2 to 1.6 per 1,000 PPM. Eliminating the first 6 months following deployment to account for user learning curve, the mean rate of PC consults nearly doubled over baseline to 33.0 and hospice referrals increased 12-fold to 2.4 PPM.\nDeployment of an AI tool at a hematology-oncology practice was found to be feasible for identifying patients at high or medium risk for short-term mortality. Insights generated by the tool drove clinical practice changes, resulting in significant increases in PC and hospice referrals.", "Serum protein electrophoresis (SPE) is a common clinical laboratory test, mainly indicated for the diagnosis and follow-up of monoclonal gammopathies. A time-consuming and potentially subjective human expertise is required for SPE analysis to detect possible pitfalls and to provide a clinically relevant interpretation.\nAn expert-annotated SPE dataset of 159\u2009969 entries was used to develop SPECTR (serum protein electrophoresis computer-assisted recognition), a deep learning-based artificial intelligence, which analyzes and interprets raw SPE curves produced by an analytical system into text comments that can be used by practitioners. It was designed following academic recommendations for SPE interpretation, using a transparent architecture avoiding the \"black box\" effect. SPECTR was validated on an external, independent cohort of 70\u2009362 SPEs and challenged by a panel of 9 independent experts from other hospital centers.\nSPECTR was able to identify accurately both quantitative abnormalities (r\u2009\u2265\u20090.98 for fractions quantification) and qualitative abnormalities [receiver operating characteristic-area under curve (ROC-AUC)\u2009\u2265\u20090.90 for M-spikes, restricted heterogeneity of immunoglobulins, and beta-gamma bridging]. Furthermore, it showed highly accurate at both detecting (ROC-AUC\u2009\u2265\u20090.99) and quantifying (r\u2009=\u20090.99) M-spikes. It proved highly reproducible and resilient to minor variations and its agreement with human experts was higher (\u03ba\u2009=\u20090.632) than experts between each other (\u03ba\u2009=\u20090.624).\nSPECTR is an algorithm based on artificial intelligence suitable to high-throughput SPEs analyses and interpretation. It aims at improving SPE reproducibility and reliability. It is freely available in open access through an online tool providing fully editable validation assistance for SPE.", "The COVID-19 outbreak began in December 2019 and has dreadfully affected our lives since then. More than three million lives have been engulfed by this newest member of the corona virus family. With the emergence of continuously mutating variants of this virus, it is still indispensable to successfully diagnose the virus at early stages. Although the primary technique for the diagnosis is the PCR test, the non-contact methods utilizing the chest radiographs and CT scans are always preferred. Artificial intelligence, in this regard, plays an essential role in the early and accurate detection of COVID-19 using pulmonary images. In this research, a transfer learning technique with fine tuning was utilized for the detection and classification of COVID-19. Four pre-trained models i.e., VGG16, DenseNet-121, ResNet-50, and MobileNet were used. The aforementioned deep neural networks were trained using the dataset (available on Kaggle) of 7232 (COVID-19 and normal) chest X-ray images. An indigenous dataset of 450 chest X-ray images of Pakistani patients was collected and used for testing and prediction purposes. Various important parameters, e.g., recall, specificity, F1-score, precision, loss graphs, and confusion matrices were calculated to validate the accuracy of the models. The achieved accuracies of VGG16, ResNet-50, DenseNet-121, and MobileNet are 83.27%, 92.48%, 96.49%, and 96.48%, respectively. In order to display feature maps that depict the decomposition process of an input image into various filters, a visualization of the intermediate activations is performed. Finally, the Grad-CAM technique was applied to create class-specific heatmap images in order to highlight the features extracted in the X-ray images. Various optimizers were used for error minimization purposes. DenseNet-121 outperformed the other three models in terms of both accuracy and prediction.", "A variety of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based (Machine Learning) techniques have been developed with regard to in silico prediction of Compound-Protein interactions (CPI)-one of which is a technique we refer to as chemical genomics-based virtual screening (CGBVS). Prediction calculations done via pairwise kernel-based support vector machine (SVM) is the main feature of CGBVS which gives high prediction accuracy, with simple implementation and easy handling. We studied whether the CGBVS technique can identify ligands for targets without ligand information (orphan targets) using data from G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) families. As the validation method, we tested whether the ligand prediction was correct for a virtual orphan GPCR in which all ligand information for one selected target was omitted from the training data. We have specifically expressed the results of this study as applicability index and developed a method to determine whether CGBVS can be used to predict GPCR ligands. Validation results showed that the prediction accuracy of each GPCR differed greatly, but models using Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) as the protein descriptor performed well in terms of overall prediction accuracy. We also discovered that the effect of the type compound descriptors on the prediction accuracy was less significant than that of the type of protein descriptors used. Furthermore, we found that the accuracy of the ligand prediction depends on the amount of ligand information with regard to GPCRs related to the target. Additionally, the prediction accuracy tends to be high if a large amount of ligand information for related proteins is used in the training.", "The incorporation of robots in the social fabric of our society has taken giant leaps, enabled by advances in artificial intelligence and big data. As these robots become increasingly adept at parsing through enormous datasets and making decisions where humans fall short, a significant challenge lies in the analysis of robot behavior. Capturing interactions between robots, humans and IoT devices in traditional structures such as graphs poses challenges in the storage and analysis of large data sets in dense graphs generated by frequent activities. This paper proposes a framework that uses the blockchain for the storage of robotic interactions, and the use of sheaf theory for analysis of these interactions. Applications of our framework for social robots and swarm robots incorporating imperfect information and irrationality on the blockchain sheaf are proposed. This work shows the application of such a framework for various blockchain applications on the spectrum of human-robot interaction, and identifies key challenges that arise as a result of using the blockchain for robotic applications.", "The COVID-19 pandemic has revolutionized health care for patients and providers alike. Telemedicine has moved from the periphery of our health care system to center stage more rapidly than anyone could have envisioned. Currently, virtual care has quite effectively replicated the traditional health system's care delivery model and reimbursement structure-a patient makes an appointment, then sees a physician (except with video or phone replacing in-office visits) who makes a care plan, and the patient and physician meet again at a later timepoint to assess progress. Replicating this episodic care paradigm virtually has been invaluable for delivering care swiftly during the COVID-19 pandemic; however, we can and should do more with the connectedness and convenience that telemedicine technology enables. Continuous remote care, with a data-driven, proactive outreach to patients, represents a decisive step forward in contrast to the currently available episodic, reactive, patient-initiated care. In the context of continuous remote care, patient biometric and symptom data (patient entered and connected data) are assimilated in real time by artificial intelligence-enabled clinical platforms to bring physicians' and other health care team members' attention to those patients who need intervention, whether this is via medication adjustments, acute care management, or lifestyle coaching. In this paper, we discuss how an innovative continuous remote care approach has improved outcomes in another deadly pandemic-type 2 diabetes mellitus.", "Computer-aided diagnosis systems aim to assist clinicians in the early identification of abnormal signs in order to optimize the interpretation of medical images and increase diagnostic precision. Multiple sclerosis (MS) and clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) are chronic inflammatory, demyelinating diseases affecting the central nervous system. Recent advances in deep learning (DL) techniques have led to novel computational paradigms in MS and CIS imaging designed for automatic segmentation and detection of areas of interest and automatic classification of anatomic structures, as well as optimization of neuroimaging protocols. To this end, there are several publications presenting artificial intelligence-based predictive models aiming to increase diagnostic accuracy and to facilitate optimal clinical management in patients diagnosed with MS and/or CIS. The current study presents a thorough review covering DL techniques that have been applied in MS and CIS during recent years, shedding light on their current advances and limitations.", "Under the present circumstances, when we are still under the threat of different strains of coronavirus, and since the most widely used method for COVID-19 detection, RT-PCR is a tedious and time-consuming manual procedure with poor precision, the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) is inevitable. Though, some vaccines have now been authorized worldwide, it will take huge time to reach everyone, especially in developing countries. In this work, we have analyzed Chest X-ray (CXR) images for the detection of the coronavirus. The primary agenda of this proposed research study is to leverage the classification performance of the deep learning models using ensemble learning. Many papers have proposed different ensemble learning techniques in this field, some methods using aggregation functions like Weighted Arithmetic Mean (WAM) among others. However, none of these methods take into consideration the decisions that subsets of the classifiers take. In this paper, we have applied Choquet integral for ensemble and propose a novel method for the evaluation of fuzzy measures using coalition game theory, information theory, and Lambda fuzzy approximation. Three different sets of fuzzy measures are calculated using three different weighting schemes along with information theory and coalition game theory. Using these three sets of fuzzy measures, three Choquet integrals are calculated and their decisions are finally combined. Besides, we have created a database by combining several image repositories developed recently. Impressive results on the newly developed dataset and the challenging COVIDx dataset support the efficacy and robustness of the proposed method. Our experimental results outperform many recently proposed methods.", "As our knowledge and understanding of melanoma evolve, melanoma surveillance guidelines will reflect these findings. Currently, there is no consensus across international guidelines for melanoma follow-up. However, it is accepted that more aggressive surveillance is recommended for more advanced disease. When examining high-risk individuals, a systematic approach should be followed. Future considerations include the use of noninvasive imaging techniques, 'liquid biopsies,' and artificial intelligence to enhance detection of melanomas.", "This study aimed to examine the usage, acceptability, usability, perceived usefulness, and satisfaction of a web-based video-tailored physical activity (PA) intervention (TaylorActive) in adults.\nIn 2013-2014, 501 Australian adults aged 18+ years were randomized into a video-tailored intervention, text-tailored intervention, or control group. Over 3 months, the intervention groups received access to 8 sessions of personally tailored PA advice delivered via the TaylorActive website. Only the delivery method differed between the intervention groups: video-tailored vs. text-tailored. Google Analytics and telephone surveys conducted at post intervention (3 months) were used to assess intervention usage, acceptability, usability, perceived usefulness, and satisfaction. Quantitative and qualitative process data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and thematic content analysis.\nOf 501 recruited adults, 259 completed the 3-month post-intervention survey (52% retention). Overall, usage of the TaylorActive website with respect to number of website visits, intervention sessions, and action plans completed was modest in both the video-tailored (7.6 \u00b1 7.2 visits, mean \u00b1 SD) and text-tailored (7.3 \u00b1 5.4 visits) groups with no significant between-group differences. The majority of participants in all groups used the TaylorActive website less than once in 2 weeks (66.7% video-tailored, 62.7% text-tailored, 87.5% control; p < 0.001). Acceptability was rated mostly high in all groups and, in some instances, significantly higher in the intervention groups compared to the control group (p < 0.010). Usability was also rated high; mean Systems Usability Scores were 77.3 (video-tailored), 75.7 (text-tailored), and 74.1 (control) with no significant between-group differences. Perceived usefulness of the TaylorActive intervention was low, though mostly rated higher in the intervention groups compared to the control group (p < 0.010). Satisfaction with the TaylorActive website was mixed. Participants in both intervention groups liked its ease of use, personalized feedback, and tracking of progress, but also found completing action plans and survey questions for each session repetitive and tedious.\nProviding personally tailored PA advice on its own (through either video or text) is likely insufficient to ensure good retention, usage, perceived usefulness, and satisfaction with a web-based PA intervention. Strategies to address this may include the incorporation of additional intervention components such as activity trackers, social interactions, gamification, as well as the use of advanced artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies to allow more personalized dialogue with participants.", "Chest computed tomography (CT) plays an important role in the diagnosis and assessment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).\nTo evaluate the value of an artificial intelligence (AI) scoring system for radiologically assessing the severity of COVID-19.\nChest CT images of 81 patients (61 of normal type and 20 of severe type) with confirmed COVID-19 were used. The test data were anonymized. The scores achieved by four methods (junior radiologists; AI scoring system; human-AI segmentation system; human-AI scoring system) were compared with that by two experienced radiologists (reference score). The mean absolute errors (MAEs) between the four methods and experienced radiologists were calculated separately. The Wilcoxon test is used to predict the significance of the severity of COVID-19. Then use Spearman correlation analysis ROC analysis was used to evaluate the performance of different scores.\nThe AI score had a relatively low MAE (1.67-2.21). Score of human-AI scoring system had the lowest MAE (1.67), a diagnostic value almost equal to reference score (r= 0.97), and a strongest correlation with clinical severity (r= 0.59, p< 0.001). The AUCs of reference score, score of junior radiologists, AI score, score of human-AI segmentation system, and score of human-AI scoring system were 0.874, 0.841, 0.852, 0.857 and 0.865, respectively.\nThe human-AI scoring system can help radiologists to improve the accuracy of COVID-19 severity assessment.", "AI relates broadly to the science of developing computer systems to imitate human intelligence, thus allowing for the automation of tasks that would otherwise necessitate human cognition. Such technology has increasingly demonstrated capacity to outperform humans for functions relating to image recognition. Given the current lack of cost-effective confirmatory testing, accurate diagnosis and subsequent management depend on visual detection of characteristic findings during otoscope examination. The aim of this manuscript is to perform a comprehensive literature review and evaluate the potential application of artificial intelligence for the diagnosis of ear disease from otoscopic image analysis.", "The digital workflow process follows different steps for all dental specialties. However, the main ingredient for the diagnosis, treatment planning and follow-up workflow recipes is the imaging chain. The steps in the imaging chain usually include all or at least some of the following modalities: cone-beam computed tomographic data acquisition, segmentation of the cone-beam computed tomography image, intraoral scanning, facial three-dimensional soft tissue capture and superimposition of all the images for the creation of a virtual augmented model. As a relevant clinical problem, the accumulation of error at each step of the chain might negatively influence the final outcome. For an efficient digital workflow, it is important to be aware of the existing challenges within the imaging chain. Furthermore, artificial intelligence-based strategies need to be integrated in the future to make the workflow more simplified, accurate and efficient.", "Healthcare treatments might benefit from advances in artificial intelligence and technological equipment such as smartphones and smartwatches. The presence of cameras in these devices with increasingly robust and precise pattern recognition techniques can facilitate the estimation of the wound area and other telemedicine measurements. Currently, telemedicine is vital to the maintenance of the quality of the treatments remotely. This study proposes a method for measuring the wound area with mobile devices. The proposed approach relies on a multi-step process consisting of image capture, conversion to grayscale, blurring, application of a threshold with segmentation, identification of the wound part, dilation and erosion of the detected wound section, identification of accurate data related to the image, and measurement of the wound area. The proposed method was implemented with the OpenCV framework. Thus, it is a solution for healthcare systems by which to investigate and treat people with skin-related diseases. The proof-of-concept was performed with a static dataset of camera images on a desktop computer. After we validated the approach's feasibility, we implemented the method in a mobile application that allows for communication between patients, caregivers, and healthcare professionals.", "In the past, it was believed that unilateral hearing loss has a minimal impact on the speech and language development in children. However, several studies have suggested that some school-age children with unilateral hearing loss have learning impairments in language. In the present study, we first examined whether preschool-age children with unilateral severe-to-profound hearing loss (UHL) have delays in the development of receptive vocabulary and verbal intelligence. In the follow-up study, we tested the children again after school admission. The objective of the present study was to reveal the development of receptive vocabulary and verbal intelligence from preschool to school years in children with UHL.\nFifteen Japanese preschool-age children with UHL and a control group of 20 age-matched Japanese children with bilateral normal hearing (NH), who were examined because articulation disorder was suspected, were enrolled in this study. The development of receptive vocabulary and verbal intelligence was evaluated using the Picture Vocabulary Test-Revised (PVT-R) and the Wechsler Intelligence Scale, respectively. The present retrospective study was approved by the Committee for Medical Ethics of Tokushima University Hospital (#3801).\nThe scaled score (SS) of the PVT-R and verbal intelligence quotient (VIQ)/verbal comprehension index (VCI), but not performance intelligence quotient/perceptual reasoning index in children with UHL were significantly lower than those in the control children with NH at preschool-age. The SS of the PVT-R and VIQ/VCI in children with UHL significantly improved after school admission. In the subgroup analysis, the SS of the PVT-R in the lower receptive vocabulary group of children with UHL at preschool-age was significantly increased after school admission, but the SS in the normal and higher receptive vocabulary group of children with UHL at preschool-age were still around the standardized mean of SS after school admission.\nThese findings suggest that the development of receptive vocabulary and verbal intelligence was delayed in preschool-age children with UHL and that most of them caught up to exhibit normal language ability after school admission.", "This paper explores the use of biomechanics in identifying the mechanistic causes of musculoskeletal tissue injury and degeneration. It appraises how biomechanics has been used to develop training programmes aiming to maintain or recover tissue health. Tissue health depends on the functional mechanical environment experienced by tissues during daily and rehabilitation activities. These environments are the result of the interactions between tissue motion, loading, biology, and morphology. Maintaining health of and/or repairing musculoskeletal tissues requires targeting the \"ideal\" in vivo tissue mechanics (i.e., loading and deformation), which may be enabled by appropriate real-time biofeedback. Recent research shows that biofeedback technologies may increase their quality and effectiveness by integrating a personalised neuromusculoskeletal modelling driven by real-time motion capture and medical imaging. Model personalisation is crucial in obtaining physically and physiologically valid predictions of tissue biomechanics. Model real-time execution is crucial and achieved by code optimisation and artificial intelligence methods. Furthermore, recent work has also shown that laboratory-based motion capture biomechanical measurements and modelling can be performed outside the laboratory with wearable sensors and artificial intelligence. The next stage is to combine these technologies into well-designed easy to use products to guide training to maintain or recover tissue health in the real-world.", "Very preterm children generally perform poorly in executive functions and particularly in working memory. Adaptive training tasks encouraging these children to work continuously on their personal working memory capacity can be very useful. Above all in preschool-age children, several cognitive training programs focused on improving working memory capacity. Cogmed is a computerized visuospatial cognitive training program that improves working memory in children and adolescents with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. The main objective is to assess the long-term effects (18\u2009months) of cognitive training (Cogmed) on visuospatial processing in preschool-age very preterm children with working memory impairment.\nThe EPIREMED study is a prospective, randomized, controlled, multicentric trial nested in a population based epidemiological survey. An intervention group (Cogmed cognitive training) and a control group (standard care management) will compare children aged 5\u00bd to 6\u2009years, born between 24- and 34-weeks' gestational age, with a global intelligence quotient >\u200970 and a working memory index <\u200985. The study will include 166 children from national study EPIPAGE-2 (Epidemiological Study on Small Gestational Ages). The intervention consists of 25 sessions administered over a 5- to 8-week period. The primary endpoint will be the visuospatial processing, assessed by the score of the visuospatial index: score of the WPPSI-IV (Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence). The secondary endpoints will allow to assess the executive functions, language and abilities, infant behavior, quality of life assessment, school performance and parental anxiety.\nThis project's primary goal is to demonstrate the necessity of early visuospatial memory assessment within the vulnerable population of very preterm children, and to prove the feasibility and efficacy of computerized cognitive training using online software programs. A better global neuropsychological development improvement (visuospatial processing and other far transfer) can be expected with an improvement in learning and decreased behavioral problems. In the long term, these improvements might also reduce those global costs linked to the consequences of extreme prematurity.\nNCT02757794 (registered on 2nd May 2016 at ClinicalTrial.gov).", "We sought to identify and correlate the severity of traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) associated with olfactory dysfunction with cognitive and behavioral profiles.\nPatients with TBI undergoing treatment in a specialized neuro-rehabilitation hospital.\nProspective study.\nGlasgow Coma Scale (GCS) at the time of injury and during posttraumatic amnesia. Motor functions were assessed with the Functional Instrument Measure and Disability Rating Scales. The Wechsler Adult Intelligence test was used for neuropsychologic assessment and the Neuropsychiatric Inventory was used to assess behavioral changes. The Barcelona Smell Test-24 was used to study subjective smell loss.\nA total of 111 patients with TBI were enrolled (33 females; mean age 32.86\u00a0years); 38.73% exhibited smell loss. Patients with no olfactory impairment (OI) had worse TBIs than those with OI (GCS scores 5.65 and 7.74, respectively); no significant differences in cognitive behaviors, such as attention memory, visuoperception, and visuoconstruction, were observed. However, patients with TBI and olfactory dysfunction showed statistically significant alterations in neuropsychiatric behavioral performances such as feeding when compared with patients with TBI without smell loss.\nOlfactory dysfunction in patients with a TBI correlates with altered neuropsychiatric behavioral performances such as feeding, sleeping, and motor behavior.", "The recent curriculum reform in China puts forward higher requirements for the development of physical education. In order to further improve students' physical quality and motor skills, the traditional model was improved to address the lack of accuracy in motion recognition and detection of physical condition so as to assist teachers to improve students' physical quality. First, the physical education teaching activities required by the new curriculum reform were studied with regard to the actual needs of China's current social, political, and economic development; next, the application of artificial intelligence technology to physical education teaching activities was proposed; and finally, deep learning technology was studied and a human movement recognition model based on a long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network was established to identify the movement state of students in physical education teaching activities. The designed model includes three components: data acquisition, data calculation, and data visualization. The functions of each layer were introduced; then, the intelligent wearable system was adopted to detect the status of students and a feedback system was established to assist teaching; and finally, the dataset was constructed to train and test the designed model. The experimental results demonstrate that the recognition accuracy and loss value of the training model meet the practical requirements; in the algorithm test, the motion recognition accuracy of the designed model for different subjects was greater than 97.5%. Compared with the traditional human motion recognition algorithm, the designed model had a better recognition effect. Hence, the designed model can meet the actual needs of physical education. This exploration provides a new perspective for promoting the intelligent development of physical education.", "Sign language recognition, especially the sentence recognition, is of great significance for lowering the communication barrier between the hearing/speech impaired and the non-signers. The general glove solutions, which are employed to detect motions of our dexterous hands, only achieve recognizing discrete single gestures (i.e., numbers, letters, or words) instead of sentences, far from satisfying the meet of the signers' daily communication. Here, we propose an artificial intelligence enabled sign language recognition and communication system comprising sensing gloves, deep learning block, and virtual reality interface. Non-segmentation and segmentation assisted deep learning model achieves the recognition of 50 words and 20 sentences. Significantly, the segmentation approach splits entire sentence signals into word units. Then the deep learning model recognizes all word elements and reversely reconstructs and recognizes sentences. Furthermore, new/never-seen sentences created by new-order word elements recombination can be recognized with an average correct rate of 86.67%. Finally, the sign language recognition results are projected into virtual space and translated into text and audio, allowing the remote and bidirectional communication between signers and non-signers.", "Product customisation is a topic of growing interest in Smart Manufacturing. Allowing customers to design intended products brings additional challenges to the manufacturing task, such as the increase in flexibility of the assembly theatre, the compilation of assembly instructions for possibly unique products, and stress-related risks for human operators. This work introduces ViTroVo, an artificial intelligence framework capable of (1) autonomously building a graph of assembly steps via trial-and-error (in vitro Assembly Search) and (2) presenting relevant instructions to a human operator and, by autonomously detecting her progress and affective state, adapting accordingly (in vivo Adaptive Operator Guidance). The power of ViTroVo resides in its versatile way to manipulate a given product's component Augmented Computer Aided Design (CAD+) models throughout the whole assembly task. We conducted an empirical evaluation involving participants instructed to assemble a previously unseen product. The encouraging results make us believe ViTroVo's architecture could become the foundations of highly customised flexible manufacturing.", "Artificial intelligence and machine learning are employed in creating functions for the prediction of self-compacting concrete (SCC) strength based on input variables proportion as cement replacement. SCC incorporating waste material has been used in learning approaches. Artificial neural network (ANN) support vector machine (SVM) and gene expression programming (GEP) consisting of 300 datasets have been utilized in the model to foresee the mechanical property of SCC. Data used in modeling consist of several input parameters such as cement, water-binder ratio, coarse aggregate, fine aggregate, and fly ash (FA) in combination with the superplasticizer. The best predictive models were selected based on the coefficient of determination (R2) results and model validation. Empirical relation with mathematical expression has been proposed using ANN, SVM, and GEP. The efficiency of the models is assessed by permutation features importance, statistical analysis, and comparison between regression models. The results reveal that the proposed machine learning models achieved adamant accuracy and has elucidated performance in the prediction aspect.", "A family history of alcoholism (FH) increases risk for alcohol use disorder (AUD), yet many at-risk individuals never develop alcohol use problems. FH is associated with intermediate levels of risk phenotypes, whereas distinct, compensatory brain changes likely promote resilience. Although several cognitive, behavioral, and personality factors have been associated with AUD, the relative contributions of these processes and their neural underpinnings to risk or resilience processes remains less clear. We examined whole-brain resting-state functional connectivity (FC) and behavioral metrics from 841 young adults from the Human Connectome Project, including healthy controls, individuals with AUD, and their unaffected siblings. First, we identified functional connections in which unaffected siblings were intermediate between controls and AUD, indicating AUD risk, and those in which siblings diverged, indicating resilience. Canonical correlations relating brain risk and resilience FC to behavioral patterns revealed AUD risk and resilience phenotypes. Risk phenotypes primarily implicated frontal-parietal networks corresponding with executive function, impulsivity, externalizing behaviors, and social-emotional intelligence. Conversely, resilience-related phenotypes were underpinned by networks of medial prefrontal, striatal, temporal, brainstem and cerebellar connectivity, which associated with high trait attention and low antisocial behavior. Additionally, we calculated \"polyphenotypic\" risk and resilience scores, to investigate how the relative load of risk and resilience phenotypes influenced the probability of an AUD diagnosis. Polyphenotypic scores predicted AUD in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, resilience phenotypes interacted with risk phenotypes, reducing their effects. The hypothesis-generating results revealed interpretable AUD-related phenotypes and offer brain-informed targets for developing more effective interventions.", "Emotionally intelligent leaders demonstrate a sensitivity to their own and other people's psychological health and well-being, directing others towards common goals while developing effective personal relationships with their colleagues and team members. Emotional intelligence is particularly relevant in the context of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, where nurse leaders need to demonstrate this skill when supporting their teams to manage high levels of stress, exhaustion and the risk of moral injury. This article explores emotional intelligence, discusses its importance as a characteristic of effective nurse leaders and managers, and suggests practical activities that leaders can undertake to develop their emotional intelligence skills.", "Online exam supervision technologies have recently generated significant controversy and concern. Their use is now booming due to growing demand for online courses and for off-campus assessment options amid COVID-19 lockdowns. Online proctoring technologies purport to effectively oversee students sitting online exams by using artificial intelligence (AI) systems supplemented by human invigilators. Such technologies have alarmed some students who see them as a \"Big Brother-like\" threat to liberty and privacy, and as potentially unfair and discriminatory. However, some universities and educators defend their judicious use. Critical ethical appraisal of online proctoring technologies is overdue. This essay provides one of the first sustained moral philosophical analyses of these technologies, focusing on ethical notions of academic integrity, fairness, non-maleficence, transparency, privacy, autonomy, liberty, and trust. Most of these concepts are prominent in the new field of AI ethics, and all are relevant to education. The essay discusses these ethical issues. It also offers suggestions for educational institutions and educators interested in the technologies about the kinds of inquiries they need to make and the governance and review processes they might need to adopt to justify and remain accountable for using online proctoring technologies. The rapid and contentious rise of proctoring software provides a fruitful ethical case study of how AI is infiltrating all areas of life. The social impacts and moral consequences of this digital technology warrant ongoing scrutiny and study.", "Endoscopic differential diagnoses of gastric mucosal lesions (benign gastric ulcer, early gastric cancer [EGC], and advanced gastric cancer) remain challenging. We aimed to develop and validate convolutional neural network-based artificial intelligence (AI) models: lesion detection, differential diagnosis (AI-DDx), and invasion depth (AI-ID; pT1a vs pT1b among EGC) models.\nThis study included 1366 consecutive patients with gastric mucosal lesions from 2 referral centers in\u00a0Korea. One representative endoscopic image from each patient was used. Histologic diagnoses were set as\u00a0the criterion standard. Performance of the AI-DDx (training/internal/external validation set, 1009/112/245) and AI-ID (training/internal/external validation set, 620/68/155) was compared with visual diagnoses by independent endoscopists (stratified by novice [<1 year of experience], intermediate [2-3 years of experience], and expert [>5 years of experience]) and EUS results, respectively.\nThe AI-DDx showed good diagnostic performance for both internal (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUROC]\u00a0= .86) and external validation (AUROC\u00a0= .86). The performance of the AI-DDx was better than that of novice (AUROC\u00a0= .82, P\u00a0= .01) and intermediate endoscopists (AUROC\u00a0= .84, P\u00a0= .02) but was comparable with experts (AUROC\u00a0= .89, P\u00a0= .12) in the external validation set. The AI-ID showed a fair performance in both internal (AUROC\u00a0= .78) and external validation sets (AUROC\u00a0= .73), which were significantly better than EUS results performed by experts (internal validation, AUROC\u00a0= .62; external validation, AUROC\u00a0= .56; both P\u00a0< .001).\nThe AI-DDx was comparable with experts and outperformed novice and intermediate endoscopists for the differential diagnosis of gastric mucosal lesions. The AI-ID performed better than EUS for evaluation of invasion depth.", "Deep learning (DL) is a relatively newer subdomain of machine learning (ML) with incredible potential for certain applications in the medical field. Given recent advances in its use in neuro-oncology, its role in diagnosing, prognosticating, and managing the care of cancer patients has been the subject of many research studies. The gamut of studies has shown that the landscape of algorithmic methods is constantly improving with each iteration from its inception. With the increase in the availability of high-quality data, more training sets will allow for higher fidelity models. However, logistical and ethical concerns over a prospective trial comparing prognostic abilities of DL and physicians severely limit the ability of this technology to be widely adopted. One of the medical tenets is judgment, a facet of medical decision making in DL that is often missing because of its inherent nature as a \"black box.\" A natural distrust for newer technology, combined with a lack of autonomy that is normally expected in our current medical practices, is just one of several important limitations in implementation. In our review, we will first define and outline the different types of artificial intelligence (AI) as well as the role of AI in the current advances of clinical medicine. We briefly highlight several of the salient studies using different methods of DL in the realm of neuroradiology and summarize the key findings and challenges faced when using this nascent technology, particularly ethical challenges that could be faced by users of DL.", "When using a smartwatch to obtain electrocardiogram (ECG) signals from multiple leads, the device has to be placed on different parts of the body sequentially. The ECG signals measured from different leads are asynchronous. Artificial intelligence (AI) models for asynchronous ECG signals have barely been explored.\nWe aimed to develop an AI model for detecting acute myocardial infarction using asynchronous ECGs and compare its performance with that of the automatic ECG interpretations provided by a commercial ECG analysis software. We sought to evaluate the feasibility of implementing multiple lead-based AI-enabled ECG algorithms on smartwatches. Moreover, we aimed to determine the optimal number of leads for sufficient diagnostic power.\nWe extracted ECGs recorded within 24 hours from each visit to the emergency room of Ajou University Medical Center between June 1994 and January 2018 from patients aged 20 years or older. The ECGs were labeled on the basis of whether a diagnostic code corresponding to acute myocardial infarction was entered. We derived asynchronous ECG lead sets from standard 12-lead ECG reports and simulated a situation similar to the sequential recording of ECG leads via smartwatches. We constructed an AI model based on residual networks and self-attention mechanisms by randomly masking each lead channel during the training phase and then testing the model using various targeting lead sets with the remaining lead channels masked.\nThe performance of lead sets with 3 or more leads compared favorably with that of the automatic ECG interpretations provided by a commercial ECG analysis software, with 8.1%-13.9% gain in sensitivity when the specificity was matched. Our results indicate that multiple lead-based AI-enabled ECG algorithms can be implemented on smartwatches. Model performance generally increased as the number of leads increased (12-lead sets: area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUROC] 0.880; 4-lead sets: AUROC 0.858, SD 0.008; 3-lead sets: AUROC 0.845, SD 0.011; 2-lead sets: AUROC 0.813, SD 0.018; single-lead sets: AUROC 0.768, SD 0.001). Considering the short amount of time needed to measure additional leads, measuring at least 3 leads-ideally more than 4 leads-is necessary for minimizing the risk of failing to detect acute myocardial infarction occurring in a certain spatial location or direction.\nBy developing an AI model for detecting acute myocardial infarction with asynchronous ECG lead sets, we demonstrated the feasibility of multiple lead-based AI-enabled ECG algorithms on smartwatches for automated diagnosis of cardiac disorders. We also demonstrated the necessity of measuring at least 3 leads for accurate detection. Our results can be used as reference for the development of other AI models using sequentially measured asynchronous ECG leads via smartwatches for detecting various cardiac disorders.", "True evidence-informed decision-making in public health relies on incorporating evidence from a number of sources in addition to traditional scientific evidence. Lack of access to these types of data as well as ease of use and interpretability of scientific evidence contribute to limited uptake of evidence-informed decision-making in practice. An electronic evidence system that includes multiple sources of evidence and potentially novel computational processing approaches or artificial intelligence holds promise as a solution to overcoming barriers to evidence-informed decision-making in public health.\nThis study aims to understand the needs and preferences for an electronic evidence system among public health professionals in Canada.\nAn invitation to participate in an anonymous web-based survey was distributed via listservs of 2 Canadian public health organizations in February 2019. Eligible participants were English- or French-speaking individuals currently working in public health. The survey contained both multiple-choice and open-ended questions about the needs and preferences relevant to an electronic evidence system. Quantitative responses were analyzed to explore differences by public health role. Inductive and deductive analysis methods were used to code and interpret the qualitative data. Ethics review was not required by the host institution.\nRespondents (N=371) were heterogeneous, spanning organizations, positions, and areas of practice within public health. Nearly all (364/371, 98.1%) respondents indicated that an electronic evidence system would support their work. Respondents had high preferences for local contextual data, research and intervention evidence, and information about human and financial resources. Qualitative analyses identified several concerns, needs, and suggestions for the development of such a system. Concerns ranged from the personal use of such a system to the ability of their organization to use such a system. Recognized needs spanned the different sources of evidence, including local context, research and intervention evidence, and resources and tools. Additional suggestions were identified to improve system usability.\nCanadian public health professionals have positive perceptions toward an electronic evidence system that would bring together evidence from the local context, scientific research, and resources. Elements were also identified to increase the usability of an electronic evidence system.", "Speed of sensory information processing has long been recognized as an important characteristic of global intelligence, though few studies have concurrently investigated the contribution of different types of information processing to nonverbal IQ in children, nor looked at whether chronological age vs. months of early schooling plays a larger role. Thus, this study investigated the speed of visual information processing in three tasks including a simple visual inspection time (IT) task, a visual-verbal processing task using Rapid Automatic Naming (RAN) of objects as an accepted preschool predictor of reading, and a visuomotor processing task using a game-like iPad application, (the \"SLURP\" task) that requires writing like skills, in association with nonverbal IQ (Raven's Coloured Progressive Matrices) in children (n = 100) aged 5-7 years old. Our results indicate that the rate and accuracy of information processing for all three tasks develop with age, but that only RAN and SLURP rates show significant improvement with years of schooling. RAN and SLURP also correlated significantly with nonverbal IQ scores, but not with IT. Regression analyses demonstrate that months of formal schooling provide additional contributions to the speed of dual-task visual-verbal (RAN) and visuomotor performance and Raven's scores supporting the domain-specific hypothesis of processing speed development for specific skills as they contribute to global measures such as nonverbal IQ. Finally, RAN and SLURP are likely to be useful measures for the early identification of young children with lower intelligence and potentially poor reading.", "The Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic impelled several research efforts, from collecting COVID-19 patients' data to screening them for virus detection. Some COVID-19 symptoms are related to the functioning of the respiratory system that influences speech production; this suggests research on identifying markers of COVID-19 in speech and other human generated audio signals. In this article, we give an overview of research on human audio signals using 'Artificial Intelligence' techniques to screen, diagnose, monitor, and spread the awareness about COVID-19. This overview will be useful for developing automated systems that can help in the context of COVID-19, using non-obtrusive and easy to use bio-signals conveyed in human non-speech and speech audio productions.", "Although intelligence beliefs have been applied to explain the influence of cognition, behavior, and creativity, the research on creativity is still limited. Therefore, in order to effectively expand the understanding of the influence of intelligence beliefs on the creative performance of learners' graphics, the implicit theories of intelligence were exploited as the basis of this study. Three hypothetical pathways were proposed to be explored, and a research model was validated. First- and second-year students from a technical high school in New Taipei City were invited to participate. There were 273 valid data (88.9% of complete data). Reliability and validity analyses were performed, as well as overall model fit analysis and research model validation, and descriptive statistical analysis of the learners' performance in applying the operational virtual reality (VR). The results of this study showed that: (1) Incremental beliefs of aesthetic intelligence had a positive effect on spatial performance; (2) entity belief of spatial intelligence (EBSI) had a negative effect on spatial performance; and (3) spatial performance had a positive effect on graphical design performance. From the results, it is clear that design teachers can assess students' implicit beliefs in the early stages of teaching to actively promote better spatial performance when students show high levels of entity beliefs.", "We aimed to reveal the relationship of meditation with emotional intelligence (EI), sleep quality and melatonin level.\nA cross-sectional study.\nOur current research was performed on middle-aged women. EI scale, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and night-time saliva melatonin were measured for 65 participants including 33 meditators and 32 controls.\nThe meditation group showed a significantly higher EI score than the control group. In the regression analysis between EI and age, only the meditation group showed a significant positive correlation. The Pearson correlation analysis among all participants revealed a significant negative correlation between PSQI and EI. There was no significant group difference in the melatonin and PSQI.", "The early detection of retinopathy among diabetics is of utmost importance.\nTo estimate the diagnostic accuracy of two diabetic retinopathy (DR) screening strategies currently used in the Chilean public health system.\nCross-sectional observational study of 371 diabetic patients aged 61 \u00b1 14 years (61% women) who underwent DR screening at a public Hospital between July 1 and August 31, 2019. The mydriatic retinal photographs of all participants were classified using artificial intelligence software (DART) and trained medical technologists, independently. The precision of both strategies was compared with the reference standard, namely the evaluation of the fundus by an ophthalmologist with a slit lamp. Participants with severe non-proliferative DR or worse were considered as positive cases. The ophthalmologist was blind to the results of the screening tests.\nTwenty four percent of participants had DR, including 34 (9.2%) who had sight threatening DR in at least one eye. The sensitivity and specificity of DART were 100% (95% confidence intervals (CI): 90-100%) and 55,4% (95% CI: 50-61%), respectively. Medical technologists had a sensitivity of 97,1% (95% CI: 85-100%) and a specificity of 91,7% (95% CI: 88-94%). The only case missed by medical technologists was a patient with unilateral panphotocoagulated DR.\nBoth strategies had a similar sensitivity to detect cases of sight-threatening DR. However, the specificity of DART was significantly lower compared to medical technologists, which would greatly increase the burden on the health system, a very important aspect to consider in a screening strategy.", "Cerebral palsy (CP) is the leading cause of disability in children. While motor deficits define CP, many patients experience behavioral and cognitive deficits which limit participation. The purpose of this study was to contribute to our understanding of developmental delay and how to measure these deficits among children with CP.\nChildren 5 to 15\u2009years with hemiplegic CP were recruited. Cognition and motor ability were assessed. The brain injury associated with observed motor deficits was identified. Accelerometers measured real-world bilateral upper extremity movement and caregivers completed behavioral assessments.\nEleven children participated, 6 with presumed perinatal stroke. Four children scored below average intelligence quotient while other measures of cognition were within normal limits (except processing speed). Motor scores confirmed asymmetrical deficits. Approximately one third of scores indicated deficits in attention, behavior, or depression.\nOur findings corroborate that children with CP experience challenges that are broader than motor impairment alone. Despite the variation in brain injury, all participants completed study procedures.\nOur findings suggest that measuring behavior in children with CP may require a more comprehensive approach and that caregivers are amenable to using online collection tools which may assist in addressing the therapeutic needs of children with CP.", "Preterm children obtain worse scores in tests that evaluate visuospatial functions. Pascual's graphomotor test (PGMt) assesses maturity in copying drawings in childhood, quickly evaluating the graphomotor aptitude that is a partial aspect of non-verbal intelligence.\nTo evaluate visuospatial functions in preterm children compared to full-term children. To assess the capacity of the Pascual graphomotor test (PGMt) to detect visuospatial disorders more specifically than non-verbal intelligence quotient (IQ).\ncase and control study.\npreterm children between 5 and 11\u00a0years of age without cognitive delay; controls: full-term children with the same characteristics. For each child clinical history, neurological examination, language-free intelligence test Toni 2 (IQ) and Pascual's graphomotor test (PGMt) were carried out.\n135 children were enrolled (59 cases vs. 79 controls). The mean age was 7.4\u00a0years. 55% were male. The mean gestational age of cases was 30.5\u00a0weeks with 34% extremely preterm. Cases obtained worse mean scores in both tests. The mean IQ scores were: cases 117.4, controls 125.0 (p\u00a0=\u00a00.004). The mean graphomotor quotient (GQ) scores were statistically and clinically significant (cases 76.8; controls 98.3, p\u00a0=\u00a00.001). Although we have found a positive correlation between IQ and GQ scores (cc\u00a0=\u00a00.31 p\u00a0=\u00a00.01), the differences found in the GQ between groups have been maintained regardless of the IQ in the multivariate analysis (GQ: cases 78.3 (SD 14.8), controls 98.3 (SD 12.5), p\u00a0=\u00a00.04).\nGQ is a useful tool for screening for visuospatial anomalies. GQ more specifically measures the visuoperceptive disorder regardless of non-verbal cognitive level.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) assistance has been considered as a promising way to improve colonoscopic polyp detection, but there are limited prospective studies on real-time use of AI systems.\nWe conducted a prospective, multicenter, randomized controlled trial of patients undergoing colonoscopy at six centers. Eligible patients were randomly assigned to conventional colonoscopy (control group) or AI-assisted colonoscopy (AI group). AI assistance was our newly developed AI system for real-time colonoscopic polyp detection. Primary outcome is polyp detection rate (PDR). Secondary outcomes include polyps per positive patient (PPP), polyps per colonoscopy (PPC), and non-first polyps per colonoscopy (PPC-Plus).\nA total of 2352 patients were included in the final analysis. Compared with the control, AI group did not show significant increment in PDR (38.8% vs. 36.2%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.183), but its PPC-Plus was significantly higher (0.5 vs. 0.4, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). In addition, AI group detected more diminutive polyps (76.0% vs. 68.8%, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) and flat polyps (5.9% vs. 3.3%, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). The effects varied somewhat between centers. In further logistic regression analysis, AI assistance independently contributed to the increment of PDR, and the impact was more pronounced for male endoscopists, shorter insertion time but longer withdrawal time, and elderly patients with larger waist circumference.\nThe intervention of AI plays a limited role in overall polyp detection, but increases detection of easily missed polyps; ChiCTR.org.cn number, ChiCTR1800015607.", "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the most sensitive imaging modality in detecting breast cancer. The purpose of this systematic review is to investigate the role of human extracted MRI phenotypes in classifying molecular subtypes of breast cancer.\nWe performed a literature search of published articles on the application of MRI phenotypic features in invasive breast cancer molecular subtype classifications by radiologists' interpretation on Medline Complete, Pubmed, and Google scholar from 1st January 2000 to 31st March 2021. Of the 1453 literature identified, 42 fulfilled the inclusion criteria.\nAll studies were case-controlled, retrospective study and research-based. The majority of the studies assessed the MRI features using American College of Radiology- Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (ACR-BIRADS) classification and using dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) kinetic features, Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC) values, and T2 sequence. Most studies divided invasive breast cancer into 4 main subtypes, luminal A, luminal B, HER2, and triple-negative (TN) cancers, and used 2 readers. We present a summary of the radiologists' extracted breast MRI phenotypical features and their correlating breast cancer subtypes classifications. The characteristic features are morphology, enhancement kinetics, and T2 signal intensity. We found that the TN subtype has the most distinctive MRI features compared to the other subtypes and luminal A and B have many similar features.\nThe MRI features which are predictive of each subtype are the morphology, internal enhancement features, and T2 signal intensity, predominantly between TN and the rest. Radiologists' visual interpretation of some of MRI features may offer insight into the respective invasive breast cancer molecular subtype. However, current evidence are still limited to \"suggestive\" features instead of a diagnostic standard.\u00a0 Further research is recommended to explore this potential application, for example, by augmentation of radiologists' visual interpretation by artificial intelligence.", "Little is known about the potential of artificial intelligence in forensic shotgun pattern interpretation. As shooting distance is among the main factors behind shotgun patterning, this proof-of-concept study aimed to explore the potential of neural net architectures to correctly classify shotgun pattern images in terms of shooting distance. The study material comprised a total of 106 shotgun pattern images from two discrete shooting distances (n\u00a0=\u00a054 images from 10\u00a0m and n\u00a0=\u00a052 images from 17.5\u00a0m) recorded on blank white paper. The dataset was used to train, validate and test deep learning algorithms to correctly classify images in terms of shooting distance. The open source AIDeveloper software was used for the deep learning procedure. In this dataset, a TinyResNet-based algorithm reached the highest testing accuracy of 94%. Of the testing set, the algorithm classified all 10\u00a0m patterns correctly, and misclassified one 17.5\u00a0m pattern. On the basis of these preliminary data, it seems achievable to develop algorithms that would serve as a beneficial tool for forensic investigators when estimating shooting distances from shotgun patterns. In the future, studies with larger and more complex datasets are needed to develop robust and applicable algorithms for forensic shotgun pattern interpretation.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) is widely discussed in the popular literature and is portrayed as impacting many aspects of human life, both in and out of the workplace. The potential for revolutionizing healthcare is significant because of the availability of increasingly powerful computational platforms and methods, along with increasingly informative sources of patient data, both in and out of clinical settings. This review aims to provide a realistic assessment of the potential for AI in understanding and managing diabetes, accounting for the state of the art in the methodology and medical devices that collect data, process data, and act accordingly. Acknowledging that many conflicting definitions of AI have been put forth, this article attempts to characterize the main elements of the field as they relate to diabetes, identifying the main perspectives and methods that can (i) affect basic understanding of the disease, (ii) affect understanding of risk factors (genetic, clinical, and behavioral) of diabetes development, (iii) improve diagnosis, (iv) improve understanding of the arc of disease (progression and personal/societal impact), and finally (v) improve treatment.", "Although coaching is a co-created process, researchers investigating the psychological aspects of Olympic coaching have tended to overlook the perceptions of athletes and whether these distinguish between performance-related outcomes. The objective of this research was to examine whether athletes' perceptions of their coaches discriminate between world-leading (i.e., Olympic gold medal winning) and world-class (i.e., Olympic non-gold medal winning) coaches. Observer-reported psychometric questionnaires were completed by 38 Olympic swimmers who had collectively won 59 Olympic medals, of which 31 were gold. The questionnaires assessed perceptions of 12 variables within the Big Five personality traits, the dark triad, and emotional intelligence, and the data was analyzed using three one-way multivariate analysis of variance and follow-up univariate F-tests. The results showed that world-leading coaches were perceived to be significantly higher on conscientiousness, openness to experience, perception of emotion, and management of others emotion, and lower on narcissism, than world-class coaches. This suggests that athletes' perceptions of their coaches may discriminate between world-leading and world-class coaches. The implications for coaches' psychological development are discussed and compared with previously reported Olympic coaches' perceptions of themselves.", "In recent years, interest in home energy management systems (HEMS) has grown significantly, as well as the development of Voice Assistants that substantially increase home comfort. This paper presents a novel merging of HEMS with the Assistant paradigm. The combination of both concepts has allowed the creation of a high-performance and easy-to-manage expert system (ES). It has been developed in a framework that includes, on the one hand, the efficient energy management functionality boosted with an Internet of Things (IoT) platform, where artificial intelligence (AI) and big data treatment are blended, and on the other hand, an assistant that interacts both with the user and with the HEMS itself. The creation of this ES has made it possible to optimize consumption levels, improve security, efficiency, comfort, and user experience, as well as home security (presence simulation or security against intruders), automate processes, optimize resources, and provide relevant information to the user facilitating decision making, all based on a multi-objective optimization (MOP) problem model. This paper presents both the scheme and the results obtained, the synergies generated, and the conclusions that can be drawn after 24 months of operation.", "Machine learning (ML) represents a collection of advanced data modeling techniques beyond the traditional statistical models and tests with which most clinicians are familiar. While a subset of artificial intelligence, ML is far from the science fiction impression frequently associated with AI. At its most basic, ML is about pattern finding, sometimes with complex algorithms. The advanced mathematical modeling of ML is seeing expanding use throughout healthcare and increasingly in the day-to-day practice of surgeons. As with any new technique or technology, a basic understanding of principles, applications, and limitations are essential for appropriate implementation. This primer is intended to provide the surgical reader an accelerated introduction to applied ML and considerations in potential research applications or the review of publications, including ML techniques.", "How does the human brain code knowledge about the world? While disciplines such as artificial intelligence represent world knowledge based on human language, neurocognitive models of knowledge have been dominated by sensory embodiment, in which knowledge is derived from sensory/motor experience and supported by high-level sensory/motor and association cortices. The neural correlates of an alternative disembodied symbolic system had previously been difficult to establish. A recent line of studies exploring knowledge about visual properties, such as color, in visually deprived individuals converge to provide positive, compelling evidence for non-sensory, language-derived, knowledge representation in dorsal anterior temporal lobe and extended language network, in addition to the sensory-derived representations, leading to a sketch of a dual-coding knowledge neural framework.", "The growing demand for everyday data insights drives the pursuit of more sophisticated infrastructures and artificial intelligence algorithms. When combined with the growing number of interconnected devices, this originates concerns about scalability and privacy. The main problem is that devices can detect the environment and generate large volumes of possibly identifiable data. Public cloud-based technologies have been proposed as a solution, due to their high availability and low entry costs. However, there are growing concerns regarding data privacy, especially with the introduction of the new General Data Protection Regulation, due to the inherent lack of control caused by using off-premise computational resources on which public cloud belongs. Users have no control over the data uploaded to such services as the cloud, which increases the uncontrolled distribution of information to third parties. This work aims to provide a modular approach that uses cloud-of-clouds to store persistent data and reduce upfront costs while allowing information to remain private and under users' control. In addition to storage, this work also extends focus on usability modules that enable data sharing. Any user can securely share and analyze/compute the uploaded data using private computing without revealing private data. This private computation can be training machine learning (ML) models. To achieve this, we use a combination of state-of-the-art technologies, such as MultiParty Computation (MPC) and K-anonymization to produce a complete system with intrinsic privacy properties.", "Soil-transmitted helminths (STH) are the most prevalent pathogens among the group of neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). The Kato-Katz technique is the diagnosis method recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) although it often presents a decreased sensitivity in low transmission settings and it is labour intensive. Visual reading of Kato-Katz preparations requires the samples to be analyzed in a short period of time since its preparation. Digitizing the samples could provide a solution which allows to store the samples in a digital database and perform remote analysis. Artificial intelligence (AI) methods based on digitized samples can support diagnosis by performing an objective and automatic quantification of disease infection. In this work, we propose an end-to-end pipeline for microscopy image digitization and automatic analysis of digitized images of STH. Our solution includes (a) a digitization system based on a mobile app that digitizes microscope samples using a 3D printed microscope adapter, (b) a telemedicine platform for remote analysis and labelling, and (c) novel deep learning algorithms for automatic assessment and quantification of parasitological infections by STH. The deep learning algorithm has been trained and tested on 51 slides of stool samples containing 949 Trichuris spp. eggs from 6 different subjects. The algorithm evaluation was performed using a cross-validation strategy, obtaining a mean precision of 98.44% and a mean recall of 80.94%. The results also proved the potential of generalization capability of the method at identifying different types of helminth eggs. Additionally, the AI-assisted quantification of STH based on digitized samples has been compared to the one performed using conventional microscopy, showing a good agreement between measurements. In conclusion, this work has presented a comprehensive pipeline using smartphone-assisted microscopy. It is integrated with a telemedicine platform for automatic image analysis and quantification of STH infection using AI models.", "Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are vital energy-storage devices in modern society. However, the performance and cost are still not satisfactory in terms of energy density, power density, cycle life, safety, etc. To further improve the performance of batteries, traditional \"trial-and-error\" processes require a vast number of tedious experiments. Computational chemistry and artificial intelligence (AI) can significantly accelerate the research and development of novel battery systems. Herein, a heterogeneous category of AI technology for predicting and discovering battery materials and estimating the state of the battery system is reviewed. Successful examples, the challenges of deploying AI in real-world scenarios, and an integrated framework are analyzed and outlined. The state-of-the-art research about the applications of ML in the property prediction and battery discovery, including electrolyte and electrode materials, are further summarized. Meanwhile, the prediction of battery states is also provided. Finally, various existing challenges and the framework to tackle the challenges on the further development of machine learning for rechargeable LIBs are proposed.", "Nowadays people are mostly focused on their work while ignoring their health which in turn is creating a drastic effect on their health in the long run. Remote health monitoring through telemedicine can help people discover potential health threats in time. In the COVID-19 pandemic, remote health monitoring can help obtain and analyze biomedical signals including human body temperature without direct body contact. This technique is of great significance to achieve safe and efficient health monitoring in the COVID-19 pandemic. Existing remote biomedical signal monitoring methods cannot effectively analyze the time series data. This paper designs a remote biomedical signal monitoring framework combining the Internet of Things (IoT), 5G communication and artificial intelligence techniques. In the constructed framework, IoT devices are used to collect biomedical signals at the perception layer. Subsequently, the biomedical signals are transmitted through the 5G network to the cloud server where the GRU-AE deep learning model is deployed. It is noteworthy that the proposed GRU-AE model can analyze multi-dimensional biomedical signals in time series. Finally, this paper conducts a 24-week monitoring experiment for 2000 subjects of different ages to obtain real data. Compared with the traditional biomedical signal monitoring method based on the AutoEncoder model, the GRU-AE model has better performance. The research has an important role in promoting the development of biomedical signal monitoring techniques, which can be effectively applied to some kinds of remote health monitoring scenario.", "Electrocardiographic signals (ECG) and heart rate viability measurements (HRV) provide information in a range of specialist fields, extending to musical perception. The ECG signal records heart electrical activity, while HRV reflects the state or condition of the autonomic nervous system. HRV has been studied as a marker of diverse psychological and physical diseases including coronary heart disease, myocardial infarction, and stroke. HRV has also been used to observe the effects of medicines, the impact of exercise and the analysis of emotional responses and evaluation of effects of various quantifiable elements of sound and music on the human body. Variations in blood pressure, levels of stress or anxiety, subjective sensations and even changes in emotions constitute multiple aspects that may well-react or respond to musical stimuli. Although both ECG and HRV continue to feature extensively in research in health and perception, methodologies vary substantially. This makes it difficult to compare studies, with researchers making recommendations to improve experiment planning and the analysis and reporting of data. The present work provides a methodological framework to examine the effect of sound on ECG and HRV with the aim of associating musical structures and noise to the signals by means of artificial intelligence (AI); it first presents a way to select experimental study subjects in light of the research aims and then offers possibilities for selecting and producing suitable sound stimuli; once sounds have been selected, a guide is proposed for optimal experimental design. Finally, a framework is introduced for analysis of data and signals, based on both conventional as well as data-driven AI tools. AI is able to study big data at a single stroke, can be applied to different types of data, and is capable of generalisation and so is considered the main tool in the analysis.", "Degenerative Cervical Myelopathy (DCM) is a common and disabling condition, with a relatively modest research capacity. In order to accelerate knowledge discovery, the AO Spine RECODE-DCM project has recently established the top priorities for DCM research. Uptake of these priorities within the research community will require their effective dissemination, which can be supported by identifying key opinion leaders (KOLs). In this paper, we aim to identify KOLs using artificial intelligence. We produce and explore a DCM co-authorship network, to characterise researchers' impact within the research field.\nThrough a bibliometric analysis of 1674 scientific papers in the DCM field, a co-authorship network was created. For each author, statistics about their connections to the co-authorship network (and so the nature of their collaboration) were generated. Using these connectedness statistics, a neural network was used to predict H-Index for each author (as a proxy for research impact). The neural network was retrospectively validated on an unseen author set.\nDCM research is regionally clustered, with strong collaboration across some international borders (e.g., North America) but not others (e.g., Western Europe). In retrospective validation, the neural network achieves a correlation coefficient of 0.86 (p<0.0001) between the true and predicted H-Index of each author. Thus, author impact can be accurately predicted using only the nature of an author's collaborations.\nAnalysis of the neural network shows that the nature of collaboration strongly impacts an author's research visibility, and therefore suitability as a KOL. This also suggests greater collaboration within the DCM field could help to improve both individual research visibility and global synergy.", "Sustainable ultrathin stretchable power sources have emerged with the development of wearable electronics. They obtain energy from living organisms and the environment to drive these wearable electronics. Here, an ultrathin stretchable and triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) improved by chargeable carbon black (CB)/thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) composite material (CT-TENG) is proposed for mechanical energy harvesting and physiological signal sensing. The CB/TPU composite can act as both a stretchable electrode and a triboelectric layer due to the coexistence of conductive CB and dielectric TPU. The CT-TENG demonstrates good stretchability (\u2248646%), ultrathin thickness (\u224850 \u03bcm), and a lightweight (\u224862 mg). The triboelectric electrode material can be improved by postcharging treatment. With the corona charging process, the output performance of the CT-TENG was improved eightfold and reached 41 V. Moreover, the CT-TENG with a self-powered sensing capability can inspect the amplitude and frequency of different physiological movements. Consequently, the CT-TENG is promising in promoting the development of electronic skins, wearable systems of self-powered sensors, human-machine interactions, soft robotics, and artificial intelligence applications.", "The rapid development of human-machine interfaces and artificial intelligence is dependent on flexible and wearable soft devices such as sensors and energy storage systems. One of the key factors for these devices is the design of a flexible electrode with high sensitivity, fast response time, and a wide working range. Here, we report the fabrication of strain sensors and all-solid-state flexible supercapacitors using Co@N-CNT/MXenes as an electrode material. The manufactured sensor shows a high tensile range (strain up to 200%) and high stability. The resistance change caused by the fingers touching the sensor can be used to transmit the Morse code information. Flexible supercapacitors serving as power supply demonstrate excellent cycling stability (85\u2009000 cycles) and coulombic efficiency (99.7%) for their high surface area and pseudocapacitance. A self-powered integrated system composed of the strain sensor and flexible supercapacitor is fabricated and operates stably in a wide strain sensing test range. Moreover, the flexible solar-charging self-powered integrated system could be attached to the human body for stable human motion detection. This study clearly shows that appropriate selection of a single functional material to enable it to be used in multi-functional sensors and supercapacitors can simplify the process and reduce the cost of manufacturing wearable devices.", "Recent efforts for cell-based meat cuts focus on engineering edible scaffolds, with visual cues which are key to enhancing consumer acceptance, receiving less attention Here, we employed artificial intelligence (AI)-based screening of potential plant materials and discovered that jackfruit (Artocarpus heterophyllus) has the natural structures to recapitulate marbling visuals of meat cuts. Plant tissue compositions are exploited for its differential polyphenol adsorption to produce complex marbling patterns. A one-step colour control method by varying oxidation and incubation conditions of polyphenols was developed to produce permanent meat-like colours resembling chicken, pork, and beef. The scaffold exhibits a meat-like browning behaviour when cooked and is shown to support high-density porcine myoblasts culture without masking the marbled appearance. Surveys with 78 volunteers found that marbled jackfruit scaffolds improved consumer perception of cell-based meat by \u223c8%. Our approach of combining AI, tissue engineering, and sensory science unlocks the possibility of creating a range of novel cell-based meat cuts with consumer focus.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science with a variety of subfields and techniques, exploited to serve as a deductive tool that performs tasks originally requiring human cognition. AI tools and its subdomains are being incorporated into healthcare delivery for the improvement of medical data interpretation encompassing clinical management, diagnostics, and prognostic outcomes. In the field of neuroradiology, AI manifested through deep machine learning and connected neural networks (CNNs) has demonstrated incredible accuracy in identifying pathology and aiding in diagnosis and prognostication in several areas of neurology and neurosurgery. In this literature review, we survey the available clinical data highlighting the utilization of AI in the field of neuroradiology across multiple neurological and neurosurgical subspecialties. In addition, we discuss the emerging role of AI in neuroradiology, its strengths and limitations, as well as future needs in strengthening its role in clinical practice. Our review evaluated data across several subspecialties of neurology and neurosurgery including vascular neurology, spinal pathology, traumatic brain injury (TBI), neuro-oncology, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, and epilepsy. AI has established a strong presence within the realm of neuroradiology as a successful and largely supportive technology aiding in the interpretation, diagnosis, and even prognostication of various pathologies. More research is warranted to establish its full scientific validity and determine its maximum potential to aid in optimizing and providing the most accurate imaging interpretation.", "The aim of the current study was to investigate the personality characteristics and developmental characteristics of primary school students' personality types in a cross-sectional sample of 10,366 Chinese children. The Personality Inventory for Primary School Student was used to evaluate primary school students' personality. Latent profile analysis (LPA) was used to classify primary school students' personality types. One-way ANOVA was used to explore the personality characteristics of personality types, and Chi-square tests were used to investigate grade and gender differences of primary school students' personality types. Results showed that the primary school students could be divided into three personality types: the resilient, the overcontrolled, and the undercontrolled. Resilients had the highest scores, and undercontrollers had the lowest scores on all of five personality dimensions (intelligence, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and emotional stability). The overcontrollers' scores on personality were between the other two types, with lower emotional stability. As the grade level increased, the proportion of undercontrolled students in primary schools generally showed an upward trend and reached the maximum in grade 5. The proportion of resilient students in primary schools generally showed a downward trend. The proportion of resilient students was highest in grade 2 and lowest in grade 5. Girls were significantly more likely than boys to be resilient personality types, while boys were significantly more likely than girls to be undercontrolled personality types. The overcontrolled personality type did not show significant gender differences. Because of the undesirable internalizing problems related to overcontrollers and the externalizing problems related to undercontrollers, our results have implications for Chinese schools, families, and society in general.", "Diabetes mellitus is a major health problem among people with physical disabilities. Health coaching has been proven to be an effective approach in terms of behavioral changes, patient self-efficacy, adherence to treatment, health service use, and health outcomes. Telehealth systems combined with health coaching have the potential to improve the quality of health care by increasing access to services. Treatment fidelity is particularly important for behavior change studies; however, fidelity protocols are inadequately administered and reported in the literature.\nThe aim of this study is to outline all the intervention fidelity strategies and procedures of a telecoaching intervention-artificial intelligence for diabetes management (AI4DM)-which is a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of a telehealth platform in adults with type 2 diabetes and permanent impaired mobility. AI4DM aims to create a web-based disability-inclusive diabetes self-management program. We selected the National Institutes of Health Behavior Change Consortium (NIH BCC) fidelity framework to describe strategies to ensure intervention fidelity in our research.\nWe have developed fidelity strategies based on the five fidelity domains outlined by the NIH BCC-focusing on study design, provider training, treatment delivery, treatment receipt, and enactment of treatment skills. The design of the study is grounded in the social cognitive theory and is intended to ensure that both arms would receive the same amount of attention from the intervention. All providers will receive standardized training to deliver consistent health coaching to the participants. The intervention will be delivered through various controlling and monitoring strategies to reduce differences within and between treatment groups. The content and structure of the study are delivered to ensure comprehension and participation among individuals with low health literacy. By constantly reviewing and monitoring participant progress and protocol adherence, we intend to ensure that participants use cognitive and behavioral skills in real-world settings to engage in health behavior.\nEnrollment for AI4DM will begin in October 2021 and end in October 2022. The results of this study will be reported in late 2022.\nDeveloping and using fidelity protocols in behavior change studies is essential to ensure the internal and external validity of interventions. This study incorporates NIH BCC recommendations into an artificial intelligence embedded telecoaching platform for diabetes management designed for people with physical disabilities. The developed fidelity protocol can provide guidance for other researchers conducting telehealth interventions within behavioral health settings to present more consistent and reproducible research.\nClinicalTrials.gov NCT04927377; http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04927377.\nPRR1-10.2196/31695.", "Scientists should not play a role in investigations nor should investigators play a role in the scientific analyses. One way to bridge the relationship between the forensic scientist and the police investigator is through an Intelligence Analyst (IA) who is part of the forensic services operation. The IA offers the ability to walk between the role of scientist and law enforcement, receiving data after completion of scientific analyses and translating the information into actionable intelligence. The additional bridging and translating services represent a paradigm shift with increased emphasis on investigative contributions from forensic analysis. Forensic intelligence incorporates forensic data early in an investigation in a holistic case approach that incorporates possible datasets and information that could be relevant to the investigation. We present a brief review of the value added when an IA provides the bridge between the forensic laboratory and police investigators to enhance the use of forensic evidence.", "The borderline intellectual functioning (BIF) is a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by a borderline intelligence quotient (range 70-85) with difficulties in cognitive and social domains. Children with BIF often live in adverse conditions and show academic and behavioral difficulties. Rehabilitation programs for these children focus mainly on cognitive aspects, sometimes with the aid of new technologies that are able to engage and motivate. In this framework, the affective development of children with BIF and its possible role both in the difficulties they manifest and in the rehabilitation is still poorly investigated. In this work, we investigate the characteristics of the internal working models of these children by applying the separation anxiety test, using both the classical and a new coding system to identify the specific features of the attachment representation. Results delineate a profile characterized by low self-confidence and high separation anxiety, with a tendency to somatization. In the light of these results, we suggest that this attachment profile has an impact on the therapeutic relationships and on the efficacy in the use of technological devices. We propose a new perspective in which the interpersonal relationship with the psychologist and the support of the self-confidence of children are crucial to treating cognitive and behavioral difficulties in children with BIF. Only in this case, the use of new technologies and tools may be effective in promoting the greatest possible benefit from therapeutic interventions.", "We aimed to develop a novel recurrence prediction model for stage II-III colon cancer using simple auto-artificial intelligence (AI) with improved accuracy compared to conventional statistical models.\nA total of 787 patients who had undergone curative surgery for stage II-III colon cancer between 2000 and 2018 were included. Binomial logistic regression analysis was used to calculate the effect of variables on recurrence. The auto-AI software 'Prediction One' (Sony Network Communications Inc.) was used to predict recurrence with the same dataset used for the conventional statical model. Predictive accuracy was assessed by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).\nThe AUC of the multivariate model was 0.719 (95%CI=0.655-0.784), whereas that of the AI model was 0.815, showing a significant improvement.\nThis auto-AI prediction model demonstrates improved accuracy compared to the conventional model. It could be constructed by clinical surgeons who are not familiar with AI.", "Biological thiols importantly regulate the intracellular redox activity and metabolic level, but many of the developed probes for biothiols are facing difficulty in effectively distinguishing GSH from Cys/Hcy due to the similarity in mechanism. In this work, despite the previous pattern of \"Logic Gate\", we reported the concept of \"Fluorescence Fusion\" for the first time to achieve only one excitation-emission process. The exploited the probe, MZ-NBD, could quickly measure GSH in 10\u00a0min with a large Stokes shift (130\u00a0nm). Though the reacting mechanism was similar, only GSH could cause the \"Fluorescence Fusion\" with only one strong fluorescence response while Cys/Hcy caused two peaks. Adjusting the excitation wavelength could hardly split the fused peak into two. Though image recognition by artificial intelligence could easily distinguish the patterns of peaks, here we used the signal-treating method to realize the high selectivity towards GSH. Moreover, MZ-NBD could be utilized for rapid detection of GSH in living MCF-7\u00a0cells, which was more suitable for GSH than using the \"Logic Gate\" strategy. More than introducing a novel probe with the new concept, this work was meaningful as the linker of traditional reaction-based fluorescent probes and potential image recognition by artificial intelligence, thus led to various future researches in inter-disciplines.", "New technologies, such as brain-computer interfaces technology, advanced artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and virtual reality technology, have a strong influence on our daily activities. The application and commercialization of these technologies are prevailing globally, such as distance education, health monitoring, smart home devices, and robots. However, we still know little about the roles of individual emotion and the external environment on the commercialization of these new technologies. Therefore, we focus on the emotional factor of the leader, which is their passion for work, and discuss its effect on technology commercialization. We also analyzed the moderating role of incubation support in the relationship between the leader's emotion and technology commercialization. The results contribute to the application of emotion in improving the commercialization of new technologies.", "By means of artificial intelligence, 3D angiography is a novel postprocessing method for 3D imaging of cerebral vessels. Because 3D angiography does not require a mask run like the current standard 3D-DSA, it potentially offers a considerable reduction of the patient radiation dose. Our aim was an assessment of the diagnostic value of 3D angiography for visualization of cerebrovascular pathologies.\n3D-DSA data sets of cerebral aneurysms (n CA = 10), AVMs (n AVM = 10), and dural arteriovenous fistulas (dAVFs) (n dAVF = 10) were reconstructed using both conventional and prototype software. Corresponding reconstructions have been analyzed by 2 neuroradiologists in a consensus reading in terms of image quality, injection vessel diameters (vessel diameter [VD] 1/2), vessel geometry index (VGI = VD1/VD2), and specific qualitative/quantitative parameters of AVMs (eg, location, nidus size, feeder, associated aneurysms, drainage, Spetzler-Martin score), dAVFs (eg, fistulous point, main feeder, diameter of the main feeder, drainage), and cerebral aneurysms (location, neck, size).\nIn total, 60 volumes have been successfully reconstructed with equivalent image quality. The specific qualitative/quantitative assessment of 3D angiography revealed nearly complete accordance with 3D-DSA in AVMs (eg, mean nidus size3D angiography/3D-DSA= 19.9 [SD, 10.9]/20.2 [SD, 11.2] mm; r = 0.9, P = .001), dAVFs (eg, mean diameter of the main feeder3D angiography/3D-DSA= 2.04 [SD, 0.65]/2.05 [SD, 0.63] mm; r = 0.9, P = .001), and cerebral aneurysms (eg, mean size3D angiography/3D-DSA= 5.17 [SD, 3.4]/5.12 [SD, 3.3] mm; r = 0.9, P = .001). Assessment of the geometry of the injection vessel in 3D angiography data sets did not differ significantly from that of 3D-DSA (vessel geometry indexAVM: r = 0.84, P = .003; vessel geometry indexdAVF: r = 0.82, P = .003; vessel geometry indexCA: r = 0.84, P <.001).\nIn this study, the artificial intelligence-based 3D angiography was a reliable method for visualization of complex cerebrovascular pathologies and showed results comparable with those of 3D-DSA. Thus, 3D angiography is a promising postprocessing method that provides a significant reduction of the patient radiation dose.", "While some evidence suggests a relationship between spiritual intelligence and depression, overall, research has yielded inconclusive results. We set out to expand the literature by further exploring this relationship in a Canadian sample. We also aimed to investigate the moderating effect of gender, shedding additional light on an interaction mostly overlooked in the current research. A clinical sample of 39 participants (66.7% female) completed measures of SI and depression before receiving treatment for depression in an outpatient mental health clinic. Results indicated that overall, there was a negative relationship between SI and depression symptoms (r(39)\u2009=\u2009-\u20090.55, p\u2009<\u2009.001); our findings illustrate that this beneficial relationship was driven by women. Future research of interventions aimed at improving spirituality as a means of reducing depression symptoms is warranted.", "Nowadays, releasing the Emerging Pollutants (EPs) in the nature is one of the main reasons for many health and environmental disasters. Amoxicillin as an antibiotic is one of the EPs and categorized as the Endocrine Disrupting Compounds (EDCs) in hazardous materials. Accumulation of amoxicillin in the soil bulk increases the cancer risk, drug resistances and other epidemiological diseases. Hence, the soil bioremediation of antibiotics can be a solution for this problem which is more environmental-friendly system. This study technically creates a bio-engine setup in soil bulk for remediation of amoxicillin based on Aspergillus Flavus (AF) activities and Removal Percentage (RP) of amoxicillin with Aflatoxin B1 Generation (AG) controls. The main novelty is to propose a hybrid computational intelligence approach to do optimization for mechanical and biological aspects and to predict the behavior of bio-engine's effective mechanical and biological features in an intelligent way. The optimization model is formulated by the Central Composite Design (CCD) which is set by the Response Surface Methodology (RSM). The prediction model is formulated by the Random Forest (RF), Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) and Random Tree (RT) algorithms. According to the experimental practices from real soil samples in different times and places, concentration of amoxicillin and Aflatoxin B1 are set equal to 25\u00a0mg/L (ppm) and 15\u00a0\u03bcg/L (ppb). Likewise, the outcomes of experiments in CCD-RSM computations are evaluated by curve fitting comparisons between linear, 2FI, quadratic and cubic polynomial equations with considering to regression coefficient and predicted regression coefficient values, ANOVA and optimization by sequential differentiation. Based on the results of CCD-RSM, the RP performance in the optimum conditions is measured around 86% and in 25 days after runtime, the RP and AG are balanced in the safe mode. The proposed hybrid model achieves the 0.99 accuracy. The applicability of the research is done using real field evaluations from drug industrial park in Mashhad city in Iran. Finally, a broad analysis is done and managerial insights are concluded. The main findings of the present research are: (I) with application of bioremediation from fungus activities, amoxicillin amounts can be control in soil resources with minimum AG, (II) ANFIS model has the best accuracy for smart monitoring of amoxicillin bioremediation in soil environments and (III) based on the statistical assessments Aeration Intensity and AF/Biological Waste ratio are most effective on the amoxicillin removal percentage.", "To predict the vault and the EVO-implantable collamer lens (ICL) size by artificial intelligence (AI) and big data analytics.\nSix thousand two hundred and ninety-seven eyes implanted with an ICL from 3536 patients were included. The vault values were measured by the anterior segment analyzer (Pentacam HR). Permutation importance and Impurity-based feature importance are used to investigate the importance between the vault and input parameters. Regression models and classification models are applied to predict the vault. The ICL size is set as the target of the prediction, and the vault and the other input features are set as the new inputs for the ICL size prediction. Data were collected from 2015 to 2020. Random Forest, Gradient Boosting and XGBoost were demonstrated satisfying accuracy and mean area under the curve (AUC) scores in vault predicting and ICL sizing.\nIn the prediction of the vault, the Random Forest has the best results in the regression model (R2=0.315), then follows the Gradient Boosting (R2=0.291) and XGBoost (R2=0.285). The maximum classification accuracy is 0.828 in Random Forest, and the mean AUC is 0.765. The Random Forest predicts the ICL size with an accuracy of 82.2% and the Gradient Boosting and XGBoost, which are also compatible with 81.5% and 81.8% accuracy, respectively.\nRandom Forest, Gradient Boosting and XGBoost models are applicable for vault predicting and ICL sizing. AI may assist ophthalmologists in improving ICL surgery safety, designing surgical strategies, and predicting clinical outcomes.", "To monitor groundwater salinization due to seawater intrusion (SWI) in the aquifer of the eastern Nile Delta, Egypt, we developed a predictive regression model based on an innovative approach using SWI indicators and artificial intelligence (AI) methodologies. Hydrogeological and hydrogeochemical data of the groundwater wells in three periods (1996, 2007, and 2018) were used as input data for the AI methods. All the studied indicators were enrolled in feature extraction process where the most significant inputs were determined, including the studied year, the distance from the shoreline, the aquifer type, and the hydraulic head. These inputs were used to build four basic AI models to get the optimal prediction results of the used indicators (the base exchange index (BEX), the groundwater quality index for seawater intrusion (GQISWI), and water quality). The machine learning models utilized in this study are logistic regression, Gaussian process regression, feedforward backpropagation neural networks (FFBPN), and deep learning-based long-short-term memory. The FFBPN model achieved higher evaluation results than other models in terms of root mean square error (RMSE) and R2 values in the testing phase, with R2 values of 0.9667, 0.9316, and 0.9259 for BEX, GQISWI, and water quality, respectively. Accordingly, the FFBPN was used to build a predictive model for electrical conductivity for the years 2020 and 2030. Reasonable results were attained despite the imbalanced nature of the dataset for different times and sample sizes. The results show that the 1000 \u03bcS/cm boundary is expected to move inland ~9.5 km (eastern part) to ~10 km (western part) to ~12.4 km (central part) between 2018 and 2030. This encroachment would be hazardous to water resources and agriculture unless action plans are taken.", "Endothelial glycocalyx (EG) is a forest-like structure, covering the lumen side of blood vessel walls. EG is exposed to the mechanical forces of blood flow, mainly shear, and closely associated with vascular regulation, health, diseases, and therapies. One hallmark function of the EG is mechanotransduction, which means the EG senses the mechanical signals from the blood flow and then transmits the signals into the cells. Using numerical modelling methods or in silico experiments to investigate EG-related topics has gained increasing momentum in recent years, thanks to tremendous progress in supercomputing. Numerical modelling and simulation allows certain very specific or even extreme conditions to be fulfilled, which provides new insights and complements experimental observations. This mini review examines the application of numerical methods in EG-related studies, focusing on how computer simulation contributes to the understanding of EG as a mechanotransducer. The numerical methods covered in this review include macroscopic (i.e., continuum-based), mesoscopic [e.g., lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) and dissipative particle dynamics (DPD)] and microscopic [e.g., molecular dynamics (MD) and Monte Carlo (MC) methods]. Accounting for the emerging trends in artificial intelligence and the advent of exascale computing, the future of numerical simulation for EG-related problems is also contemplated.", "Systematic and scoping literature searches are increasingly resource intensive. We present the results of a scoping review which combines the use of a novel artificial-intelligence-(AI)-assisted Medline search tool with two other 'traditional' literature search methods. We illustrate this novel approach with a case study to identify and map the range of conditions (clinical presentations, complications, coinfections and health problems) associated with gonorrhoea infection.\nTo fully characterize the range of health outcomes associated with gonorrhoea, we combined a high yield preliminary search with a traditional systematic search, then supplemented with the output of a novel AI-assisted Medline search tool based on natural language processing methods to identify eligible literature.\nWe identified 189 health conditions associated with gonorrhoea infection of which: 53 were identified through the initial 'high yield' search; 99 through the systematic search; and 124 through the AI-assisted search. These were extracted from 107 unique references and 21 International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems Ninth and Tenth Revision (ICD 9/10) or Read codes. Health conditions were mapped to the urogenital tract (n\u00a0=\u200986), anorectal tract (n\u00a0=\u20096) oropharyngeal tract (n\u00a0=\u20095) and the eye (n\u00a0=\u200914); and other conditions such as systemic (n\u00a0=\u200961) and neonatal conditions (n\u00a0=\u20097), psychosocial associations (n\u00a0=\u20093), and co-infections (n\u2009=\u20097). The 107 unique references attained a Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) score of \u22652++ (n\u00a0=\u20092), 2+ (14 [13%]), 2- (30 [28%]) and 3 (45 [42%]), respectively. The remaining papers (n\u00a0=\u200916) were reviews.\nThrough AI screening of Medline, we captured - titles, abstracts, case reports and case series related to rare but serious health conditions related to gonorrhoea infection. These outcomes might otherwise have been missed during a systematic search. The AI-assisted search provided a useful addition to traditional/manual literature searches especially when rapid results are required in an exploratory setting.", "We aimed to develop a machine learning (ML) classifier to detect and compare major psychiatric disorders using electroencephalography (EEG). We retrospectively collected data from medical records, intelligence quotient (IQ) scores from psychological assessments, and quantitative EEG (QEEG) at resting-state assessments from 945 subjects [850 patients with major psychiatric disorders (six large-categorical and nine specific disorders) and 95 healthy controls (HCs)]. A combination of QEEG parameters including power spectrum density (PSD) and functional connectivity (FC) at frequency bands was used to establish models for the binary classification between patients with each disorder and HCs. The support vector machine, random forest, and elastic net ML methods were applied, and prediction performances were compared. The elastic net model with IQ adjustment showed the highest accuracy. The best feature combinations and classification accuracies for discrimination between patients and HCs with adjusted IQ were as follows: schizophrenia = alpha PSD, 93.83%; trauma and stress-related disorders = beta FC, 91.21%; anxiety disorders = whole band PSD, 91.03%; mood disorders = theta FC, 89.26%; addictive disorders = theta PSD, 85.66%; and obsessive-compulsive disorder = gamma FC, 74.52%. Our findings suggest that ML in EEG may predict major psychiatric disorders and provide an objective index of psychiatric disorders.", "To describe the innovative intraoperative technologies emerging to aid surgeons during minimally invasive robotic-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy.\nWe searched multiple electronic databases reporting on intraoperative imaging and navigation technologies, robotic surgery in combination with 3D modeling and 3D printing used during laparoscopic or robotic-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy. Additional searches were conducted for articles that considered the role of artificial intelligence and machine learning and their application to robotic surgery. We excluded studies using intraoperative navigation technologies during open radical prostatectomy and studies considering technology to visualize lymph nodes. Intraoperative imaging using either transrectal ultrasonography or augmented reality was associated with a potential decrease in positive surgical margins rates. Improvements in detecting capsular involvement may be seen with augmented reality. The benefit, feasibility and applications of other imaging modalities such as 3D-printed models and optical imaging are discussed.\nThe application of image-guided surgery and robotics has led to the development of promising new intraoperative imaging technologies such as augmented reality, fluorescence imaging, optical coherence tomography, confocal laser endomicroscopy and 3D printing. Currently challenges regarding tissue deformation and automatic tracking of prostate movements remain and there is a paucity in the literature supporting the use of these technologies. Urologic surgeons are encouraged to improve and test these advanced technologies in the clinical arena, preferably with comparative, randomized, trials.", "A deep learning model (DLM) that enables non-invasive hypokalemia screening from an electrocardiogram (ECG) may improve the detection of this life-threatening condition. This study aimed to develop and evaluate the performance of a DLM for the detection of hypokalemia from the ECGs of emergency patients.\nWe used a total of 9908 ECG data from emergency patients who were admitted at the Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, Jiangxi, China, from September 2017 to October 2020. The DLM was trained using 12 ECG leads (lead I, II, III, aVR, aVL, aVF, and V1-6) to detect patients with serum potassium concentrations <3.5 mmol/L and was validated using retrospective data from the Jiangling branch of the Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University. The blood draw was completed within 10 min before and after the ECG examination, and there was no new or ongoing infusion during this period.\nWe used 6904 ECGs and 1726 ECGs as development and internal validation data sets, respectively. In addition, 1278 ECGs from the Jiangling branch of the Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University were used as external validation data sets. Using 12 ECG leads (leads I, II, III, aVR, aVL, aVF, and V1-6), the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of the DLM was 0.80 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.77-0.82) for the internal validation data set. Using an optimal operating point yielded a sensitivity of 71.4% and a specificity of 77.1%. Using the same 12 ECG leads, the external validation data set resulted in an AUC for the DLM of 0.77 (95% CI: 0.75-0.79). Using an optimal operating point yielded a sensitivity of 70.0% and a specificity of 69.1%.\nIn this study, using 12 ECG leads, a DLM detected hypokalemia in emergency patients with an AUC of 0.77 to 0.80. Artificial intelligence could be used to analyze an ECG to quickly screen for hypokalemia.", "In this review, the fundamental basis of machine learning (ML) and data mining (DM) are summarized together with the techniques for distilling knowledge from state-of-the-art omics experiments. This includes an introduction to the basic mathematical principles of unsupervised/supervised learning methods, dimensionality reduction techniques, deep neural networks architectures and the applications of these in bioinformatics. Several case studies under evaluation mainly involve next generation sequencing (NGS) experiments, like deciphering gene expression from total and single cell (scRNA-seq) analysis; for the latter, a description of all recent artificial intelligence (AI) methods for the investigation of cell sub-types, biomarkers and imputation techniques are described. Other areas of interest where various ML schemes have been investigated are for providing information regarding transcription factors (TF) binding sites, chromatin organization patterns and RNA binding proteins (RBPs), while analyses on RNA sequence and structure as well as 3D dimensional protein structure predictions with the use of ML are described. Furthermore, we summarize the recent methods of using ML in clinical oncology, when taking into consideration the current omics data with pharmacogenomics to determine personalized treatments. With this review we wish to provide the scientific community with a thorough investigation of main novel ML applications which take into consideration the latest achievements in genomics, thus, unraveling the fundamental mechanisms of biology towards the understanding and cure of diseases.", "The emergence of artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things has led to a growing demand for wearable and maintenance-free power sources. The continual push toward lower operating voltages and power consumption in modern integrated circuits has made the development of devices powered by body heat finally feasible. In this context, thermoelectric (TE) materials have emerged as promising candidates for the effective conversion of body heat into electricity to power wearable devices without being limited by environmental conditions. Driven by rapid advances in processing technology and the performance of TE materials over the past two decades, wearable thermoelectric generators (WTEGs) have gradually become more flexible and stretchable so that they can be used on complex and dynamic surfaces. In this review, the functional materials, processing techniques, and strategies for the device design of different types of WTEGs are comprehensively covered. Wearable self-powered systems based on WTEGs are summarized, including multi-function TE modules, hybrid energy harvesting, and all-in-one energy devices. Challenges in organic TE materials, interfacial engineering, and assessments of device performance are discussed, and suggestions for future developments in the area are provided. This review will promote the rapid implementation of wearable TE materials and devices in self-powered electronic systems.", "The study aims to explore the application of international classification of diseases (ICD) coding technology and embedded electronic medical record (EMR) system. The study established an EMR information knowledge system and collected the data of patient medical records and disease diagnostic codes on the front pages of 8 clinical departments of endocrinology, oncology, obstetrics and gynecology, ophthalmology, orthopedics, neurosurgery, and cardiovascular medicine for statistical analysis. Natural language processing-bidirectional recurrent neural network (NLP-BIRNN) algorithm was used to optimize medical records. The results showed that the coder was not clear about the basic rules of main diagnosis selection and the classification of disease coding and did not code according to the main diagnosis principles. The disease was not coded according to different conditions or specific classification, the code of postoperative complications was inaccurate, the disease diagnosis was incomplete, and the code selection was too general. The solutions adopted were as follows: communication and knowledge training should be strengthened for coders and medical personnel. BIRNN was compared with the convolutional neural network (CNN) and recurrent neural network (RNN) in accuracy, symptom accuracy, and symptom recall, and it suggested that the proposed BIRNN has higher value. Pathological language reading under artificial intelligence algorithm provides some convenience for disease diagnosis and treatment.", "Artificial intelligence in colonoscopy is an emerging field, and its application may help colonoscopists improve inspection quality and reduce the rate of missed polyps and adenomas. Several deep learning-based computer-assisted detection (CADe) techniques were established from small single-center datasets, and unrepresentative learning materials might confine their application and generalization in wide practice. Although CADes have been reported to identify polyps in colonoscopic images and videos in real time, their diagnostic performance deserves to be further validated in clinical practice.\nTo train and test a CADe based on multicenter high-quality images of polyps and preliminarily validate it in clinical colonoscopies.\nWith high-quality screening and labeling from 55 qualified colonoscopists, a dataset consisting of over 71000 images from 20 centers was used to train and test a deep learning-based CADe. In addition, the real-time diagnostic performance of CADe was tested frame by frame in 47 unaltered full-ranged videos that contained 86 histologically confirmed polyps. Finally, we conducted a self-controlled observational study to validate the diagnostic performance of CADe in real-world colonoscopy with the main outcome measure of polyps per colonoscopy in Changhai Hospital.\nThe CADe was able to identify polyps in the test dataset with 95.0% sensitivity and 99.1% specificity. For colonoscopy videos, all 86 polyps were detected with 92.2% sensitivity and 93.6% specificity in frame-by-frame analysis. In the prospective validation, the sensitivity of CAD in identifying polyps was 98.4% (185/188). Folds, reflections of light and fecal fluid were the main causes of false positives in both the test dataset and clinical colonoscopies. Colonoscopists can detect more polyps (0.90 vs 0.82, P < 0.001) and adenomas (0.32 vs 0.30, P = 0.045) with the aid of CADe, particularly polyps < 5 mm and flat polyps (0.65 vs 0.57, P < 0.001; 0.74 vs 0.67, P = 0.001, respectively). However, high efficacy is not realized in colonoscopies with inadequate bowel preparation and withdrawal time (P = 0.32; P = 0.16, respectively).\nCADe is feasible in the clinical setting and might help endoscopists detect more polyps and adenomas, and further confirmation is warranted.", "Obesity is a major global health challenge and a risk factor for the leading causes of death, including heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and several types of cancer. Attempts to manage and regulate obesity have led to the implementation of various dietary regulatory initiatives to provide information on the calorie contents of meals. Although knowledge of the calorie content is useful for meal planning, it is not sufficient as other factors, including health status (diabetes, hypertension, etc.) and level of physical activity, are essential in the decision process for obesity management. In this work, we present an artificial intelligence- (AI-) based application that is driven by a genetic algorithm (GA) as a potential tool for tracking a user's energy balance and predicting possible calorie intake required to meet daily calorie needs for obesity management. The algorithm takes the users' input information on desired foods which are selected from a database and extracted records of users on cholesterol level, diabetes status, and level of physical activity, to predict possible meals required to meet the users need. The micro- and macronutrients of food content are used for the computation and prediction of the potential foods required to meet the daily calorie needs. The functionality and performance of the model were tested using a sample of 30 volunteers from the University of Ghana. Results revealed that the model was able to predict both glycemic and non-glycemic foods based on the condition of the user as well as the macro- and micronutrients requirements. Moreover, the system is able to adequately track the progress of the user's weight loss over time, daily nutritional needs, daily calorie intake, and predictions of meals that must be taken to avoid compromising their health. The proposed system can serve as a useful resource for individuals, dieticians, and other health management personnel for managing obesity, patients, and for training students in fields of dietetics and consumer science.", "We previously reported that children with the autosomal dominant Alzheimer disease (ADAD) presenilin 1 (PSEN1) E280A variant had early life plasma biomarker findings consistent with amyloid \u03b2 overproduction. However, the cognitive functioning of children with this variant has not been characterized vs those without the variant.\nTo test whether cognitive functioning of children with and without the PSEN1 E280A variant in the same ADAD cohort differed by genetic status (ie, PSEN1 variant) and sex.\nThis cohort study was conducted among 1354 children (including 265 children with the variant) aged 6 to 16 years recruited from the Alzheimer Prevention Initiative Colombia Registry. Participants from the city of Medell\u00edn and surrounding suburban areas traveled to the University of Antioquia to undergo all procedures. Participants were administered a Spanish version of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, Fourth Edition (WISC-IV) to measure general cognitive functioning. Data were analyzed from July through November 2020.\nUnivariate general linear models were used to characterize differences on WISC-IV cognitive performance by genetic status, sex, and the interaction of genetic status with sex. Urbanity, socioeconomic status, and education were entered as covariates.\nAmong 1354 children with ADAD (695 [51.3%] girls; mean [SD] age, 11.64 [2.64] years), there were 265 children with the variant (19.6%) and 1089 children without the variant (80.4%). Children with and without the variant did not differ by demographic variables or performance on WISC-IV indices. Irrespective of genetic status, boys had statistically significantly decreased mean scores on indices for working memory (90.27 [95% CI, 89.21-91.34] vs 92.99 [95% CI, 91.98-93.99]; mean difference\u2009=\u2009-2.72; P\u2009<\u2009.001), perceptual reasoning (91.56 [95% CI, 90.47-92.65] vs. 93.27 [95% CI, 91.23-94.30]; mean difference\u2009=\u2009-1.71; P\u2009=\u2009.03), and verbal comprehension (88.69 [95% CI, 87.54-89.84] vs. 90.81 [95% CI, 89.73-91.90]; mean difference\u2009=\u2009-2.12; P\u2009=\u2009.009) compared with girls. In the interaction between sex and genetic status, boys with the variant had worse mean working memory index performance (88.78 [95% CI, 86.86-90.70]) than girls with the variant (93.75 [95% CI, 91.95-95.55]; mean difference\u2009=\u2009-4.97; P\u2009=\u2009.001), as well as boys (91.77 [95% CI, 90.85-92.70]; mean difference\u2009=\u2009-2.99; P\u2009=\u2009.04) and girls (92.22 [95% CI, 91.32-93.13]; mean difference\u2009=\u2009-3.44; P\u2009=\u2009.009) without the variant.\nThis study found that boys with the PSEN1 variant had decreased working memory abilities compared with girls with the variant and boys and girls without the variant, suggesting a sex-specific genetic risk in early life cognitive performance among individuals with the PSEN1 variant. This increased risk of future cognitive difficulties among boys with the variant may have important downstream implications for learning and academic achievement and could be associated with sex differences seen in adulthood on episodic memory measures.", "It is well known that pedestrians are vulnerable road users. Their risk of being injured or killed in road traffic crashes is even higher as vehicle drivers often violate traffic rules and do not slow down or yield in front of crosswalks. In order to reduce this risk, many countries have issued strict regulations requiring vehicles to yield to pedestrians in front of crosswalks. While extensive literature exists on the interaction between vehicles and pedestrians, the consideration of heterogeneity in the behavior of vehicles is vastly overlooked. Accordingly, this study analyzes the yielding behavior of three types of vehicles under the \"pedestrian priority\" policy by processing drone footage collected in Xi'an City (China) with a Machine Vision Intelligent Algorithm. Moreover, this study proposes four additional indicators to the widely used yielding rate and yielding delay with the aim of evaluating yielding behavior of three types of vehicles. The results show that buses have the best yielding behavior from the perspective of yielding rate, yielding delay, waiting time, yielding angle and waiting site. Buses perform well in observing pedestrian dynamics near crosswalk, and perform exceptionally well in considering the \"blind area\" of vision. The location of the waiting site in front of the stop line and the length of the waiting time contribute to the safe crossing of pedestrians. In contrast, private cars perform badly in yielding to pedestrians. However, serious polarization can be observed across private cars, as the performance varies across the board. The relaxation of the homogenization assumption of the behavior of vehicles in pedestrian-vehicle interaction, alongside the improvements in the analysis via Machine Vision Intelligent Algorithm of videos acquired via drone, shows the possibility of having a deeper understanding of the yielding behavior of vehicles at crosswalk. The extension of the use of artificial intelligence methods to analyze drone footage has immense potential in understanding road user behavior and hence providing knowledge for crash prevention.", "Learning to act in an environment to maximise rewards is among the brain's key functions. This process has often been conceptualised within the framework of reinforcement learning, which has also gained prominence in machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) as a way to optimise decision making. A common aspect of both biological and machine reinforcement learning is the reactivation of previously experienced episodes, referred to as replay. Replay is important for memory consolidation in biological neural networks and is key to stabilising learning in deep neural networks. Here, we review recent developments concerning the functional roles of replay in the fields of neuroscience and AI. Complementary progress suggests how replay might support learning processes, including generalisation and continual learning, affording opportunities to transfer knowledge across the two fields to advance the understanding of biological and artificial learning and memory.", "Developing and enhancing emotional intelligence in nursing students is a necessary element of nursing education. Various evidence-based strategies to cultivate emotional intelligence characteristics, such as self-reflection, self-awareness, problem-solving, and interprofessional collaboration in nursing students, are described along with the value of role-modeling Christian qualities that promote empathy and compassion in nursing graduates.", "The purpose of this study was to describe incident reporters' views identified by artificial intelligence concerning the prevention of medication incidents that were assessed, causing serious or moderate harm to patients. The information identified the most important risk management areas in these medication incidents. This was a retrospective record review using medication-related incident reports from one university hospital in Finland between January 2017 and December 2019 (n = 3496). Of these, incidents that caused serious or moderate harm to patients (n = 137) were analysed using artificial intelligence. Artificial intelligence classified reporters' views on preventing incidents under the following main categories: (1) treatment, (2) working, (3) practices, and (4) setting and multiple sub-categories. The following risk management areas were identified: (1) verification, documentation and up-to-date drug doses, drug lists and other medication information, (2) carefulness and accuracy in managing medications, (3) ensuring the flow of information and communication regarding medication information and safeguarding continuity of patient care, (4) availability, update and compliance with instructions and guidelines, (5) multi-professional cooperation, and (6) adequate human resources, competence and suitable workload. Artificial intelligence was found to be useful and effective to classifying text-based data, such as the free text of incident reports.", "COVID-19 vaccines show excellent efficacy in clinical trials and effectiveness in real-world data, but some people still become infected with SARS-CoV-2 after vaccination. This study aimed to identify risk factors for post-vaccination SARS-CoV-2 infection and describe the characteristics of post-vaccination illness.\nThis prospective, community-based, nested, case-control study used self-reported data (eg, on demographics, geographical location, health risk factors, and COVID-19 test results, symptoms, and vaccinations) from UK-based, adult (\u226518 years) users of the COVID Symptom Study mobile phone app. For the risk factor analysis, cases had received a first or second dose of a COVID-19 vaccine between Dec 8, 2020, and July 4, 2021; had either a positive COVID-19 test at least 14 days after their first vaccination (but before their second; cases 1) or a positive test at least 7 days after their second vaccination (cases 2); and had no positive test before vaccination. Two control groups were selected (who also had not tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 before vaccination): users reporting a negative test at least 14 days after their first vaccination but before their second (controls 1) and users reporting a negative test at least 7 days after their second vaccination (controls 2). Controls 1 and controls 2 were matched (1:1) with cases 1 and cases 2, respectively, by the date of the post-vaccination test, health-care worker status, and sex. In the disease profile analysis, we sub-selected participants from cases 1 and cases 2 who had used the app for at least 14 consecutive days after testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 (cases 3 and cases 4, respectively). Controls 3 and controls 4 were unvaccinated participants reporting a positive SARS-CoV-2 test who had used the app for at least 14 consecutive days after the test, and were matched (1:1) with cases 3 and 4, respectively, by the date of the positive test, health-care worker status, sex, body-mass index (BMI), and age. We used univariate logistic regression models (adjusted for age, BMI, and sex) to analyse the associations between risk factors and post-vaccination infection, and the associations of individual symptoms, overall disease duration, and disease severity with vaccination status.\nBetween Dec 8, 2020, and July 4, 2021, 1\u2009240\u2009009 COVID Symptom Study app users reported a first vaccine dose, of whom 6030 (0\u00b75%) subsequently tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (cases 1), and 971\u2009504 reported a second dose, of whom 2370 (0\u00b72%) subsequently tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (cases 2). In the risk factor analysis, frailty was associated with post-vaccination infection in older adults (\u226560 years) after their first vaccine dose (odds ratio [OR] 1\u00b793, 95% CI 1\u00b750-2\u00b748; p<0\u00b70001), and individuals living in highly deprived areas had increased odds of post-vaccination infection following their first vaccine dose (OR 1\u00b711, 95% CI 1\u00b701-1\u00b723; p=0\u00b7039). Individuals without obesity (BMI <30 kg/m2) had lower odds of infection following their first vaccine dose (OR 0\u00b784, 95% CI 0\u00b775-0\u00b794; p=0\u00b70030). For the disease profile analysis, 3825 users from cases 1 were included in cases 3 and 906 users from cases 2 were included in cases 4. Vaccination (compared with no vaccination) was associated with reduced odds of hospitalisation or having more than five symptoms in the first week of illness following the first or second dose, and long-duration (\u226528 days) symptoms following the second dose. Almost all symptoms were reported less frequently in infected vaccinated individuals than in infected unvaccinated individuals, and vaccinated participants were more likely to be completely asymptomatic, especially if they were 60 years or older.\nTo minimise SARS-CoV-2 infection, at-risk populations must be targeted in efforts to boost vaccine effectiveness and infection control measures. Our findings might support caution around relaxing physical distancing and other personal protective measures in the post-vaccination era, particularly around frail older adults and individuals living in more deprived areas, even if these individuals are vaccinated, and might have implications for strategies such as booster vaccinations.\nZOE, the UK Government Department of Health and Social Care, the Wellcome Trust, the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, UK Research and Innovation London Medical Imaging and Artificial Intelligence Centre for Value Based Healthcare, the UK National Institute for Health Research, the UK Medical Research Council, the British Heart Foundation, and the Alzheimer's Society.", "A number of Artificial Intelligence (AI) ethics frameworks have been published in the last 6\u00a0years in response to the growing concerns posed by the adoption of AI in different sectors, including healthcare. While there is a strong culture of medical ethics in healthcare applications, AI-based Healthcare Applications (AIHA) are challenging the existing ethics and regulatory frameworks. This scoping review explores how ethics frameworks have been implemented in AIHA, how these implementations have been evaluated and whether they have been successful. AI specific ethics frameworks in healthcare appear to have a limited adoption and they are mostly used in conjunction with other ethics frameworks. The operationalisation of ethics frameworks is a complex endeavour with challenges at different levels: ethics principles, design, technology, organisational, and regulatory. Strategies identified in this review are proactive, contextual, technological, checklist, organisational and/or evidence-based approaches. While interdisciplinary approaches show promises, how an ethics framework is implemented in an AI-based Healthcare Application is not widely reported, and there is a need for transparency for trustworthy AI.", "Sepsis is a severe infection that increases mortality risk and is one if the main causes of death in intensive care units. Accurate detection is key to successful interventions, but diagnosis of sepsis is complicated because the initial signs and symptoms are not specific. Biomarkers that have been proposed have low specificity and sensitivity, are expensive, and not available in every hospital. In this study, we propose the use of artificial intelligence in the form of a neural network to diagnose sepsis using only common laboratory tests and vital signs that are routine and widely available.\nA retrospective, cross sectional cohort of 113 patients from an intensive care unit, each with 48 routinely evaluated vital signs and biochemical parameters was used to train, validate and test a neural network with 48 inputs, 10 neurons in a single hidden layer and one output. The sensitivity and specificity of the neural network as a point sampled diagnostic test was calculated.\nAll but one case were correctly diagnosed by the neural network, with 91% sensitivity and 100% specificity in the validation data set, and 100% sensitivity and specificity in the test data set.\nThe designed neural network system can identify patients with sepsis, with minimal resources using standard laboratory tests widely available in most health care facilities. This should reduce the burden on the medical staff of a difficult diagnosis and should improve outcomes for patients with sepsis.", "The complexity of the emotional presentation of users to Artificial Intelligence (AI) virtual assistants is mainly manifested in user motivation and social emotion, but the current research lacks an effective conversion path from emotion to acceptance. This paper innovatively cuts from the perspective of trust, establishes an AI virtual assistant acceptance model, conducts an empirical study based on the survey data from 240 questionnaires, and uses multilevel regression analysis and the bootstrap method to analyze the data. The results showed that functionality and social emotions had a significant effect on trust, where perceived humanity showed an inverted U relationship on trust, and trust mediated the relationship between both functionality and social emotions and acceptance. The findings explain the emotional complexity of users toward AI virtual assistants and extend the transformation path of technology acceptance from the trust perspective, which has implications for the development and design of AI applications.", "Musculoskeletal research has been enriched in the past ten years with a great wealth of new discoveries arising from genome wide association studies (GWAS). In addition to the novel factors identified by GWAS, the advent of whole-genome and whole-exome sequencing efforts in family based studies has also identified new genes and pathways. However, the function and the mechanisms by which such genes influence clinical traits remain largely unknown. There is imperative need to bring multidisciplinary expertise together that will allow translating these genomic discoveries into useful clinical applications with the potential of improving patient care. Therefore \"GEnomics of MusculoSkeletal traits TranslatiOnal NEtwork\" (GEMSTONE) aims to set the ground for the: 1) functional characterization of discovered genes and pathways; 2)\u00a0understanding of the correspondence between molecular and clinical assessments; and 3)\u00a0implementation of novel methodological approaches. This research network is funded by The European Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST). GEMSTONE includes six working groups (WG), each with specific objectives: WG1-Study populations and expertise groups: creating, maintaining and updating an inventory of experts and resources (studies and datasets) participating in the network, helping to assemble focus groups defined by phenotype, functional and methodological expertise. WG2-Phenotyping: describe ways to decompose the phenotypes of the different functional studies into meaningful components that will aid the interpretation of identified biological pathways. WG3 Monogenic conditions - human KO models: makes an inventory of genes underlying musculoskeletal monogenic conditions that aids the assignment of genes to GWAS signals and prioritizing GWAS genes as candidates responsible for monogenic presentations, through biological plausibility. WG4 Functional investigations: creating a roadmap of genes and pathways to be prioritized for functional assessment in cell and organism models of the musculoskeletal system. WG5 Bioinformatics seeks the integration of the knowledge derived from the distinct efforts, with particular emphasis on systems biology and artificial intelligence applications. Finally, WG6 Translational outreach: makes a synopsis of the knowledge derived from the distinct efforts, allowing to prioritize factors within biological pathways, use refined disease trait definitions and/or improve study design of future investigations in a potential therapeutic context (e.g. clinical trials) for musculoskeletal diseases.", "Diagnostic support using artificial intelligence may contribute to the equalization of endoscopic diagnosis of colorectal lesions. We developed computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) support system for diagnosing colorectal lesions using the NBI International Colorectal Endoscopic (NICE) classification and the Japan NBI Expert Team (JNET) classification.\nUsing Residual Network as the classifier and NBI images as training images, we developed a CADx based on the NICE classification (CADx-N) and a CADx based on the JNET classification (CADx-J). For validation, 480 non-magnifying and magnifying NBI images were used for the CADx-N and 320 magnifying NBI images were used for the CADx-J. The diagnostic performance of the CADx-N was evaluated using the magnification rate.\nThe accuracy of the CADx-N for Types 1, 2, and 3 was 97.5%, 91.2%, and 93.8%, respectively. The diagnostic performance for each magnification level was good (no statistically significant difference). The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy of the CADx-J were 100%, 96.3%, 82.8%, 100%, and 96.9% for Type 1; 80.3%, 93.7%, 94.1%, 79.2%, and 86.3% for Type 2A; 80.4%, 84.7%, 46.8%, 96.3%, and 84.1% for Type 2B; and 62.5%, 99.6%, 96.8%, 93.8%, and 94.1% for Type 3, respectively.\nThe multi-class CADx systems had good diagnostic performance with both the NICE and JNET classifications and may aid in educating non-expert endoscopists and assist in diagnosing colorectal lesions.", "Computer aided orthopedic surgery suffers from low clinical adoption, despite increased accuracy and patient safety. This can partly be attributed to cumbersome and often radiation intensive registration methods. Emerging RGB-D sensors combined with artificial intelligence data-driven methods have the potential to streamline these procedures. However, developing such methods requires vast amount of data. To this end, a multi-modal approach that enables acquisition of large clinical data, tailored to pedicle screw placement, using RGB-D sensors and a co-calibrated high-end optical tracking system was developed. The resulting dataset comprises RGB-D recordings of pedicle screw placement along with individually tracked ground truth poses and shapes of spine levels L1-L5 from ten cadaveric specimens. Besides a detailed description of our setup, quantitative and qualitative outcome measures are provided. We found a mean target registration error of 1.5 mm. The median deviation between measured and ground truth bone surface was 2.4 mm. In addition, a surgeon rated the overall alignment based on 10% random samples as 5.8 on a scale from 1 to 6. Generation of labeled RGB-D data for orthopedic interventions with satisfactory accuracy is feasible, and its publication shall promote future development of data-driven artificial intelligence methods for fast and reliable intraoperative registration.", "The complex polygenic nature of lung cancer is not fully characterized. Our study seeks to identify novel phenotypes associated with lung cancer using cross-trait linkage disequilibrium score regression (LDSR). We measured pairwise genetic correlation (rg) and SNP heritability (h2) between 347 traits and lung cancer risk using genome-wide association study summary statistics from the UKBB and OncoArray consortium. Further, we conducted analysis after removing genomic regions previously associated with smoking behaviors to mitigate potential confounding effects. We found significant negative genetic correlations between lung cancer risk and dietary behaviors, fitness metrics, educational attainment, and other psychosocial traits. Alcohol taken with meals (rg\u2009=\u2009-\u00a00.41, h2\u2009=\u20090.10, p\u2009=\u20091.33\u2009\u00d7\u200910-16), increased fluid intelligence scores (rg\u2009=\u2009-\u00a00.25, h2\u2009=\u20090.22, p\u2009=\u20094.54\u2009\u00d7\u200910-8), and the\u00a0age at which\u00a0full time education was completed (rg\u2009=\u2009-\u00a00.45, h2\u2009=\u20090.11, p\u2009=\u20091.24\u2009\u00d7\u200910-20) demonstrated negative genetic correlation with lung cancer susceptibility. The body mass index was positively correlated with lung cancer risk (rg\u2009=\u20090.20, h2\u2009=\u20090.25, p\u2009=\u20092.61\u2009\u00d7\u200910-9). This analysis reveals shared genetic architecture between several traits and lung cancer predisposition. Future work should test for causal relationships and investigate common underlying genetic mechanisms across these genetically correlated traits.", "Intellectual disability (ID) is a neurodevelopmental disorder defined by below-average intelligence (intelligence quotient of <70) accompanied by adaptive behavior deficits. Defects in the functions of neural stem cells during brain development are closely linked to the pathogenesis of ID. To understand the molecular etiology of ID, we examined neural stem cells from individuals with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), a genetic disorder in which approximately one-third of the patients exhibit ID. In this study, we generated induced pluripotent stem cells from peripheral blood mononuclear cells from a normal individual and DMD patients with and without ID to identify ID-specific functional and molecular abnormalities. We found defects in neural ectoderm formation in the group of DMD patients with ID. Our transcriptome analysis of patient-derived neural stem cells revealed altered expression of genes related to the hippo signaling pathway and neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, implicating these in the pathogenesis of ID in patients with DMD.", "The objective of the study is to conduct an exploratory review of the Covid-19 pandemic by focusing on the theme of Covid-19 pandemic morbidity and mortality, considering the dynamics of artificial intelligence and quality of life (QOL). The methods used in this research paper include a review of literature, anecdotal evidence, and reports on the morbidity of COVID-19, including the scope of its devastating effects in different countries such as the US, Africa, UK, China, and Brazil, among others. The findings of this study suggested that the devastating effects of the coronavirus are felt across different vulnerable populations. These include the elderly, front-line workers, marginalized communities, visible minorities, and more. The challenge in Africa is especially daunting because of inadequate infrastructure, and financial and human resources, among others. Besides, AI technology is being successfully used by scientists to enhance the development process of vaccines and drugs. However, its usage in other stages of the pandemic has not been adequately explored. Ultimately, it has been concluded that the effects of the Covid-19 are producing unprecedented and catastrophic outcomes in many countries. With a few exceptions, the common and current intervention approach is driven by many factors, including the compilation of relevant reliable and compelling data sets. On a positive note, the compelling trailblazing and catalytic contributions of AI towards the rapid discovery of COVID-19 vaccines are a good indication of future technological innovations and their effectiveness.", "Disruptive innovation completely changes the traditional way that we operate and may only be realized in retrospect. For example, shoulder superior capsule reconstruction (SCR) is a complete change from the traditional methods of treating massive, irreparable rotator cuff tears and pseudoparalysis. Classic examples of disruptions in orthopaedic surgery include distraction osteogenesis, total hip joint replacement arthroplasty, and modern orthopaedic trauma care. Orthopaedic technologies that promise future disruption include artificial intelligence, surgical simulation, and orthopaedic biologics, including mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC) and gene therapy. Most of all, arthroscopic surgery completely changed the way we operate by using new methods and technology. Many never saw it coming. The challenge going forward is to motivate and foster new ideas and research that result in innovation and progress. Skepticism has a place, but not at the expense of transformative ideas, particularly as medical journals offer the alternative of prospective hypothesis testing using the scientific method, followed by unbiased peer review, and publication. Medical journals should be a forum for disruptive research.", "Prediction of breeding values is central to plant breeding and has been revolutionized by the adoption of genomic selection (GS). Use of machine- and deep-learning algorithms applied to complex traits in plants can improve prediction accuracies. Because of the tremendous increase in collected data in breeding programs and the slow rate of genetic gain increase, it is required to explore the potential of artificial intelligence in analyzing the data. The main objectives of this study include optimization of multitrait (MT) machine- and deep-learning models for predicting grain yield and grain protein content in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) using spectral information. This study compares the performance of four machine- and deep-learning-based unitrait (UT) and MT models with traditional genomic best linear unbiased predictor (GBLUP) and Bayesian models. The dataset consisted of 650 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) from a spring wheat breeding program grown for three years (2014-2016), and spectral data were collected at heading and grain filling stages. The MT-GS models performed 0-28.5 and -0.04 to 15% superior to the UT-GS models. Random forest and multilayer perceptron were the best performing machine- and deep-learning models to predict both traits. Four explored Bayesian models gave similar accuracies, which were less than machine- and deep-learning-based models and required increased computational time. Green normalized difference vegetation index (GNDVI) best predicted grain protein content in seven out of the nine MT-GS models. Overall, this study concluded that machine- and deep-learning-based MT-GS models increased prediction accuracy and should be employed in large-scale breeding programs.", "Children born preterm (<37 weeks' gestation) have an increased risk of poor neurodevelopment, including lower intelligence quotient (IQ) scores compared with their term-born counterparts.\nTo explore the differences in psychometric scores for cognition and motor skills when they are age-standardized according to chronological age instead of corrected age for children born preterm.\nWe assessed = 554 children born <33 weeks' gestation with the Bayley Scales of Infant Development, 2nd edition (mental and motor scores) at 18 months and the Weschler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (IQ score) at seven years of age. Scores were standardized according to chronological age and corrected age and differences between mean chronological and corrected scores were compared, along with the proportion of children whose scores could be classified as impaired.\nWhen scores were standardized according to chronological age instead of corrected age there was a large significant difference of 17.3 points on the mental scale (79.5 vs. 96.8, respectively) and 11.8 points on the motor scale (84.8 vs. 96.6, respectively) at 18 months. By seven years, the difference in IQ scores remained, although of a smaller magnitude at 1.9 points between mean chronological and corrected age scoring (97.2 vs. 99.1, respectively).\nConsistent with previous literature, outcome assessments for preterm infants consistently differed according to use of chronological or corrected age to standardized scores. Cognitive scores were impacted more severely than motor scores, and differences were more substantial in early childhood than later in childhood. For clinical purposes, correction for preterm birth is only likely to have an impact during early childhood, however assessments for research purposes should continue to correct into childhood to account for the persistent bias due to preterm birth.", "Sleep bruxism (SBx) activity is classically identified by capturing masseter and/or temporalis masticatory muscles electromyographic activity (EMG-MMA) during in-laboratory polysomnography (PSG). We aimed to identify stereotypical mandibular jaw movements (MJM) in patients with SBx and to develop rhythmic masticatory muscles activities (RMMA) automatic detection using an artificial intelligence (AI) based approach.\nThis was a prospective, observational study of 67 suspected obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) patients in whom PSG with masseter EMG was performed with simultaneous MJM recordings. The system used to collect MJM consisted of a small hardware device attached on the chin that communicates to a cloud-based infrastructure. An extreme gradient boosting (XGB) multiclass classifier was trained on 79,650 10-second epochs of MJM data from the 39 subjects with a history of SBx targeting 3 labels: RMMA episodes (n=1072), micro-arousals (n=1311), and MJM occurring at the breathing frequency (n=77,267).\nValidated on unseen data from 28 patients, the model showed a very good epoch-by-epoch agreement (Kappa = 0.799) and balanced accuracy of 86.6% was found for the MJM events when using RMMA standards. The RMMA episodes were detected with a sensitivity of 84.3%. Class-wise receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis confirmed the well-balanced performance of the classifier for RMMA (ROC area under the curve: 0.98, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.97-0.99). There was good agreement between the MJM analytic model and manual EMG signal scoring of RMMA (median bias -0.80 events/h, 95% CI -9.77 to 2.85).\nSBx can be reliably identified, quantified, and characterized with MJM when subjected to automated analysis supported by AI technology.", "COVID-19 Coronavirus variants are emerging across the globe causing ongoing pandemics. It is important to estimate the case fatality ratio (CFR) during such an epidemic of a potentially fatal disease.\nFirstly, we have performed a non-parametric approach for odds ratios with corresponding confidence intervals (CIs) and illustrated relative risks and cumulative mortality rates of COVID-19 data of Spain. We have demonstrated the modified non-parametric approach based on Kaplan-Meier (KM) technique using COVID-19 data of Italy. We have also performed the significance of characteristics of patients regarding outcome by age for both genders. Furthermore, we have applied a non-parametric cure model using Nadaraya-Watson weight to estimate cure-rate using Israel data. Simulations are based on R-software.\nThe analytical illustrations of these approaches predict the effects of patients based on covariates in different scenarios. Sex differences are increased from ages less than 60 years to 60-69 years but decreased thereafter with the smallest sex difference at ages 80 years in a case for estimating both purposes RR (relative risk) and OR (odds ratio). The non-parametric approach investigates the range of cure-rate ranges from 5.3% to 9% and from 4% to 7% approximately for male and female respectively. The modified KM estimator performs for such censored data and detects the changes in CFR more rapidly for both genders and age-wise.\nOlder-age, male-sex, number of comorbidities and access to timely health care are identified as some of the risk factors associated with COVID-19 mortality in Spain. The non-parametric approach has investigated the influence of covariates on models and it provides the effect in both genders and age. The health impact of public for inaccurate estimates, inconsistent intelligence, conflicting messages, or resulting in misinformation can increase awareness among people and also induce panic situations that accompany major outbreaks of COVID-19.", "Chronic Tic Disorder (CTD), Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) and Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) are complex neuropsychiatric disorders that frequently co-occur. The aim of this study was to examine WISC-IV performance of a clinical cohort of children with CTD, OCD and/or ADHD.\nN\u2009=\u2009185 children aged 6 to 17\u00a0years from Germany with CTD, OCD and/or ADHD were examined with the WISC-IV that comprises four index scores (VCI: Verbal Comprehension Index, PRI: Perceptual Reasoning Index, WMI: Working Memory Index, PSI: Processing Speed Index) and a Full Scale Intelligence Quotient (FSIQ). WISC-IV profiles of children with CTD-only, OCD-only, ADHD-only, CTD+ADHD, CTD+OCD and CTD+OCD+ADHD were compared with the WISC-IV norm (N\u2009=\u20091650, M\u2009=\u2009100 and SD\u2009=\u200915) and among each other.\nUnpaired t-tests revealed that children with ADHD-only showed significant lower PSI scores, whereas children with CTD-only and OCD-only had significant higher VCI scores as compared to the German WISC-IV norm. One-way ANOVA revealed that children with ADHD-only showed significant lower WMI scores as compared to children with CTD+OCD.\nWe were able to confirm previous evidence on WISC-IV profiles in ADHD in a German clinical sample and contribute new findings on cognitive performance in children with (non-)comorbid CTD and OCD that have to be seen in light of the study's limitations.", "To introduce the 2021 International Medical Informatics Association (IMIA) Yearbook by the editors.\nThe editorial provides an introduction and overview to the 2021 IMIA Yearbook whose special topic is \"Managing Pandemics with Health Informatics - Successes and Challenges\". The Special Topic, the keynote paper, and survey papers are discussed. The IMIA President's statement and the IMIA dialogue with the World Health Organization are introduced. The sections' changes in the Yearbook Editorial Committee are also described.\nHealth informatics, in the context of a global pandemic, led to the development of ways to collect, standardize, disseminate and reuse data worldwide: public health data but also information from social networks and scientific literature. Fact checking methods were mostly based on artificial intelligence and natural language processing. The pandemic also introduced new challenges for telehealth support in times of critical response. Next generation sequencing in bioinformatics helped in decoding the sequence of the virus and the development of messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) vaccines.\nThe Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic shows the need for timely, reliable, open, and globally available information to support decision making and efficiently control outbreaks. Applying Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) requirements for data is a key success factor while challenging ethical issues have to be considered.", "Transforming neural activities into language is revolutionary for human-computer interaction as well as functional restoration of aphasia. Present rapid development of artificial intelligence makes it feasible to decode the neural signals of human visual activities. In this paper, a novel Progressive Transfer Language Decoding Model (PT-LDM) is proposed to decode visual fMRI signals into phrases or sentences when natural images are being watched. The PT-LDM consists of an image-encoder, a fMRI encoder and a language-decoder. The results showed that phrases and sentences were successfully generated from visual activities. Similarity analysis showed that three often-used evaluation indexes BLEU, ROUGE and CIDEr reached 0.182, 0.197 and 0.680 averagely between the generated texts and the corresponding annotated texts in the testing set respectively, significantly higher than the baseline. Moreover, we found that higher visual areas usually had better performance than lower visual areas and the contribution curve of visual response patterns in language decoding varied at successively different time points. Our findings demonstrate that the neural representations elicited in visual cortices when scenes are being viewed have already contained semantic information that can be utilized to generate human language. Our study shows potential application of language-based brain-machine interfaces in the future, especially for assisting aphasics in communicating more efficiently with fMRI signals.", "The development of artificial intelligence (AI) and other machine diagnostic systems, also known as software as a medical device, and its recent introduction into clinical practice requires a deeply rooted foundation in bioethics for consideration by regulatory agencies and other stakeholders around the globe.\nTo initiate a dialogue on the issues to consider when developing a bioethically sound foundation for AI in medicine, based on images of eye structures, for discussion with all stakeholders.\nThe scope of the issues and summaries of the discussions under consideration by the Foundational Principles of Ophthalmic Imaging and Algorithmic Interpretation Working Group, as first presented during the Collaborative Community on Ophthalmic Imaging inaugural meeting on September 7, 2020, and afterward in the working group.\nArtificial intelligence has the potential to improve health care access and patient outcome fundamentally while decreasing disparities, lowering cost, and enhancing the care team. Nevertheless, substantial concerns exist. Bioethicists, AI algorithm experts, as well as the Food and Drug Administration and other regulatory agencies, industry, patient advocacy groups, clinicians and their professional societies, other provider groups, and payors (i.e., stakeholders) working together in collaborative communities to resolve the fundamental ethical issues of nonmaleficence, autonomy, and equity are essential to attain this potential. Resolution impacts all levels of the design, validation, and implementation of AI in medicine. Design, validation, and implementation of AI warrant meticulous attention.\nThe development of a bioethically sound foundation may be possible if it is based in the fundamental ethical principles of nonmaleficence, autonomy, and equity for considerations for the design, validation, and implementation for AI systems. Achieving such a foundation will be helpful for continuing successful introduction into medicine before consideration by regulatory agencies. Important improvements in accessibility and quality of health care, decrease in health disparities, and lower cost thereby can be achieved. These considerations should be discussed with all stakeholders and expanded on as a useful initiation of this dialogue.", "Gastric cancer accounts for a significant proportion of worldwide cancer-related morbidity and mortality. The well documented precancerous cascade provides an opportunity for clinicians to detect and treat gastric cancers at an endoscopically curable stage. In high prevalence regions such as Japan and Korea, this has led to the implementation of population screening programs. However, guidelines remain ambiguous in lower prevalence regions. In recent years, there have been many advances in the endoscopic diagnosis and treatment of early gastric cancer and precancerous lesions. More advanced endoscopic imaging has led to improved detection and characterization of gastric lesions as well as superior accuracy for delineation of margins prior to resection. In addition, promising early data on artificial intelligence in gastroscopy suggests a future role for this technology in maximizing the yield of advanced endoscopic imaging. Data on endoscopic resection (ER) are particularly robust in Japan and Korea, with high rates of curative ER and markedly reduced procedural morbidity. However, there is a shortage of data in other regions to support the applicability of protocols from these high prevalence countries. Future advances in endoscopic therapeutics will likely lead to further expansion of the current indications for ER, as both technology and proceduralist expertise continue to grow.", "Many states in the U.S. have faced shortages of medical resources because of the surge in the number of patients suffering from COVID-19. As many projections indicate, the situation will be far worse in coming months. The upcoming challenge is not only due to the exponential growth in cases but also because of inherent uncertainty and lags associated with disease progression. In this paper, we present a collection of models for decision intelligence which provide decision-support for ventilator allocation based on predictions from well-accepted oracles of disease progression. It is clear from our study that without coordination among states, there is a very high risk of ventilator shortages in certain states. However, such shortages can be reduced, provided neighboring states agree to share ventilators as suggested by our models. We show that despite the explosive growth in cases and associated uncertainty in ventilator demand, our simulation results hold the promise of reducing unmet demand, even in the face of significant uncertainty. This paper also provides the first evidence that coordination between neighboring states can lead to significant reduction in ventilator shortages across the U.S.", "COVID-19 remains globally a highly infectious disease targeting multiple organs. Rehabilitation is increasingly valued among the supportive care fields to combat COVID-19 as currently definitive curative treatment remains largely absent. This narrative review is to address rehabilitation related topics associated with the treatment of COVID-19 patients. Nosocomial spread remains a high risk for healthcare workers, with comparable high ratios of exposed workers suffering from the disease with more severe clinical course. Primary principle of rehabilitation is to protect rehabilitation physicians and cover all person-to-person interactions. Translating perspectives are encouraged through each multidisciplinary approach. Rehabilitation for the outpatient remains a potential beneficial approach. Artificial intelligence can potentially provide aid and possible answers to important problems that may emerge involving COVID-19. The real value of rehabilitation in COVID-19 may be very impactful and beneficial for patient's physical and mental health.", "Healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) are among the most common adverse events in hospitals. We used artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms for infection surveillance in a cohort study. The model correctly detected 67 out of 73 patients with HAIs. The final model used a multilayer perceptron neural network achieving an area under receiver operating curve (AUROC) of 90.27%; specificity of 78.86%; sensitivity of 88.57%. Respiratory infections had the best results (AUROC \u226593.47%). The AI algorithm could identify most HAIs. AI is a feasible method for HAI surveillance, has the potential to save time, promote accurate hospital-wide surveillance, and improve infection prevention performance.", "Online social networking is an intrinsic part of present life. However, if individuals believe that some basic psychological needs can only be fulfilled through social networking sites, an addictive pattern of usage may emerge. Problematic social media use (PSMU) is a growing concern in adolescence. The present study aimed at contributing to prior scientific literature by testing a model that considers low emotional intelligence (EI) as a vulnerability factor, perceived stress and depressive symptoms as affective and cognitive responses to conflicting situations, and PSMU as a maladaptive coping mechanism. In this study, 2068 Spanish adolescents (46.2% male, 53.8% female) within the ages of 12 and 19 (M\u00a0=\u00a014.61, SD\u00a0=\u00a01.62) completed self-report measures of the above-mentioned constructs. Results indicated that (a) perceived stress was a significant mediator in the association between EI and PSMU, (b) depressive symptoms were a significant mediator in this link, and (c) a significant serial mediation model was supported, in which lower EI predicted higher perceived stress, which contributed to higher levels of depressive symptoms, thus resulting in higher PSMU. These results provide important empirical evidence suggesting promising pathways towards preventing PSMU in adolescents, such as EI training, teaching stress-reduction techniques and focusing on reducing depressive symptoms.", "Colon capsule endoscopy (CCE) was introduced in 2006 as a novel way to visualise the colonic mucosa. Initially, CCE validity was limited by low completion rates (CR) and poor image quality. Through technical progress and improved bowel preparations, CCE now offers an adjunct to diagnostic colonoscopy. As referred in this review, several studies have shown promising results regarding polyp detection rates by the use of CCE. Improvements in CR and quality of bowel preparation are needed for CCE to be on a par with conventional colonoscopy. Research in artificial intelligence is evolving to aid in diagnostics and staging using CCE.", "Research on the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into community-based primary health care (CBPHC) has highlighted several advantages and disadvantages in practice regarding, for example, facilitating diagnosis and disease management, as well as doubts concerning the unintended harmful effects of this integration. However, there is a lack of evidence about a comprehensive knowledge synthesis that could shed light on AI systems tested or implemented in CBPHC.\nWe intended to identify and evaluate published studies that have tested or implemented AI in CBPHC settings.\nWe conducted a systematic scoping review informed by an earlier study and the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) scoping review framework and reported the findings according to PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis-Scoping Reviews) reporting guidelines. An information specialist performed a comprehensive search from the date of inception until February 2020, in seven bibliographic databases: Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), ScienceDirect, and IEEE Xplore. The selected studies considered all populations who provide and receive care in CBPHC settings, AI interventions that had been implemented, tested, or both, and assessed outcomes related to patients, health care providers, or CBPHC systems. Risk of bias was assessed using the Prediction Model Risk of Bias Assessment Tool (PROBAST). Two authors independently screened the titles and abstracts of the identified records, read the selected full texts, and extracted data from the included studies using a validated extraction form. Disagreements were resolved by consensus, and if this was not possible, the opinion of a third reviewer was sought. A third reviewer also validated all the extracted data.\nWe retrieved 22,113 documents. After the removal of duplicates, 16,870 documents were screened, and 90 peer-reviewed publications met our inclusion criteria. Machine learning (ML) (41/90, 45%), natural language processing (NLP) (24/90, 27%), and expert systems (17/90, 19%) were the most commonly studied AI interventions. These were primarily implemented for diagnosis, detection, or surveillance purposes. Neural networks (ie, convolutional neural networks and abductive networks) demonstrated the highest accuracy, considering the given database for the given clinical task. The risk of bias in diagnosis or prognosis studies was the lowest in the participant category (4/49, 4%) and the highest in the outcome category (22/49, 45%).\nWe observed variabilities in reporting the participants, types of AI methods, analyses, and outcomes, and highlighted the large gap in the effective development and implementation of AI in CBPHC. Further studies are needed to efficiently guide the development and implementation of AI interventions in CBPHC settings.", "In a world where automation is becoming increasingly common, easier collection of mass of data and powerful computer processing has meant a transformation in the field of artificial intelligence (AI). The diabetic foot is a multifactorial problem; its issues render it suitable for analysis, interrogation, and development of AI. The latter has the potential to deliver many solutions to issues of delayed diagnosis, compliance, and defining preventative treatments. We describe the use of AI and the development of artificial neural networks that may supplement the failed networks in the diabetic foot. The potential of this technology, current developing applications, and their limitations for diabetic foot care are suggested.", "Blockchain and artificial intelligence technologies are novel innovations in healthcare sector. Data on healthcare indices are collected from data published on Web of Sciences and other Google survey from various governing bodies. In this review, we focused on various aspects of blockchain and artificial intelligence and also discussed about integrating both technologies for making a significant difference in healthcare by promoting the implementation of a generalizable analytical technology that can be integrated into a more comprehensive risk management approach. This article has shown the various possibilities of creating reliable artificial intelligence models in e-Health using blockchain, which is an open network for the sharing and authorization of information. Healthcare professionals will have access to the blockchain to display the medical records of the patient, and AI uses a variety of proposed algorithms and decision-making capability, as well as large quantities of data. Thus, by integrating the latest advances of these technologies, the medical system will have improved service efficiency, reduced costs, and democratized healthcare. Blockchain enables the storage of cryptographic records, which AI needs.", "Inspired by the embodied intelligence observed in octopus arms, we introduce magnetically controlled origami robotic arms based on Kresling patterns for multimodal deformations, including stretching, folding, omnidirectional bending, and twisting. The highly integrated motion of the robotic arms is attributed to inherent features of the reconfigurable Kresling unit, whose controllable bistable deploying/folding and omnidirectional bending are achieved through precise magnetic actuation. We investigate single- and multiple-unit robotic systems, the latter exhibiting higher biomimetic resemblance to octopus' arms. We start from the single Kresling unit to delineate the working mechanism of the magnetic actuation for deploying/folding and bending. The two-unit Kresling assembly demonstrates the basic integrated motion that combines omnidirectional bending with deploying. The four-unit Kresling assembly constitutes a robotic arm with a larger omnidirectional bending angle and stretchability. With the foundation of the basic integrated motion, scalability of Kresling assemblies is demonstrated through distributed magnetic actuation of double-digit number of units, which enables robotic arms with sophisticated motions, such as continuous stretching and contracting, reconfigurable bending, and multiaxis twisting. Such complex motions allow for functions mimicking octopus arms that grasp and manipulate objects. The Kresling robotic arm with noncontact actuation provides a distinctive mechanism for applications that require synergistic robotic motions for navigation, sensing, and interaction with objects in environments with limited or constrained access. Based on small-scale Kresling robotic arms, miniaturized medical devices, such as tubes and catheters, can be developed in conjunction with endoscopy, intubation, and catheterization procedures using functionalities of object manipulation and motion under remote control.", "Chest radiography (CXR) is the most widely-used thoracic clinical imaging modality and is crucial for guiding the management of cardiothoracic conditions. The detection of specific CXR findings has been the main focus of several artificial intelligence (AI) systems. However, the wide range of possible CXR abnormalities makes it impractical to detect every possible condition by building multiple separate systems, each of which detects one or more pre-specified conditions. In this work, we developed and evaluated an AI system to classify CXRs as normal or abnormal. For training and tuning the system, we used a de-identified dataset of 248,445 patients from a multi-city hospital network in India. To assess generalizability, we evaluated our system using 6 international datasets from India, China, and the United States. Of these datasets, 4 focused on diseases that the AI was not trained to detect: 2 datasets with tuberculosis and 2 datasets with coronavirus disease 2019. Our results suggest that the AI system trained using a large dataset containing a diverse array of CXR abnormalities generalizes to new patient populations and unseen diseases. In a simulated workflow where the AI system prioritized abnormal cases, the turnaround time for abnormal cases reduced by 7-28%. These results represent an important step towards evaluating whether AI can be safely used to flag cases in a general setting where previously unseen abnormalities exist. Lastly, to facilitate the continued development of AI models for CXR, we release our collected labels for the publicly available dataset.", "This study aimed to develop an AI model for detecting a caller's emotional state during out-of-hospital cardiac arrest calls by processing audio recordings of dispatch communications.\nAudio recordings of 337 out-of-hospital cardiac arrest calls from March-April 2011 were retrieved. The callers' emotional state was classified based on the emotional content and cooperative scores. Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients extracted essential information from the voice signals. A support vector machine was utilised for the automatic judgement, and repeated random sub-sampling cross validation (RRS-CV) was applied to evaluate robustness. The results from the artificial intelligence classifier were compared with the consensus of expert reviewers.\nThe audio recordings were classified into five emotional content and cooperative score levels. The proposed model had an average positive predictive value of 72.97%, a negative predictive value of 93.47%, sensitivity of 38.76%, and specificity of 98.29%. If only the first 10 seconds of the recordings were considered, it had an average positive predictive value of 84.62%, a negative predictive value of 93.57%, sensitivity of 52.38%, and specificity of 98.64%. The artificial intelligence model's performance maintained preferable results for emotionally stable cases.\nArtificial intelligence models can possibly facilitate the judgement of callers' emotional states during dispatch conversations. This model has the potential to be utilised in practice, by pre-screening emotionally stable callers, thus allowing dispatchers to focus on cases that are judged to be emotionally unstable. Further research and validation are required to improve the model's performance and make it suitable for the general population.", "Bromoiesol sulfates A (1) and B (2), new polyhalogenated aryl sulfates, were isolated from a Salileptolyngbya sp. marine cyanobacterium along with their hydrolyzed compounds, bromoiesols A (3) and B (4). To pick up the candidates of their structures, we used Small Molecule Accurate Recognition Technology (SMART), an artificial intelligence-based structure-prediction tool, and their structures were elucidated on the basis of single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis of bromoiesols (3 and 4). In addition, to verify the structures, the total synthesis of bromoiesol A sulfate (1) and bromoiesol A (3) was achieved. The bromoiesol family, especially bromoiesols (3 and 4), selectively inhibited the growth of the bloodstream form of Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense, the causative agent of human African sleeping sickness.", "Creating a widely excepted model on the measure of intelligence became inevitable due to the existence of an abundance of different intelligent systems. Measuring intelligence would provide feedback for the developers and ultimately lead us to create better artificial systems. In the present paper, we show a solution where learning as a process is examined, aiming to detect pre-written solutions and separate them from the knowledge acquired by the system. In our approach, we examine image recognition software by executing different transformations on objects and detect if the software was resilient to it. A system with the required intelligence is supposed to become resilient to the transformation after experiencing it several times. The method is successfully tested on a simple neural network, which is not able to learn most of the transformations examined. The method can be applied to any image recognition software to test its abstraction capabilities.", "Quantifying meibomian gland morphology from meibography images is used for the diagnosis, treatment, and management of meibomian gland dysfunction in clinics. A novel and automated method is described for quantifying meibomian gland morphology from meibography images.\nMeibomian gland morphological abnormality is a common clinical sign of meibomian gland dysfunction, yet there exist no automated methods that provide standard quantifications of morphological features for individual glands. This study introduces an automated artificial intelligence approach to segmenting individual meibomian gland regions in infrared meibography images and analyzing their morphological features.\nA total of 1443 meibography images were collected and annotated. The dataset was then divided into development and evaluation sets. The development set was used to train and tune deep learning models for segmenting glands and identifying ghost glands from images, whereas the evaluation set was used to evaluate the performance of the model. The gland segmentations were further used to analyze individual gland features, including gland local contrast, length, width, and tortuosity.\nA total of 1039 meibography images (including 486 upper and 553 lower eyelids) were used for training and tuning the deep learning model, whereas the remaining 404 images (including 203 upper and 201 lower eyelids) were used for evaluations. The algorithm on average achieved 63% mean intersection over union in segmenting glands, and 84.4% sensitivity and 71.7% specificity in identifying ghost glands. Morphological features of each gland were also fed to a support vector machine for analyzing their associations with ghost glands. Analysis of model coefficients indicated that low gland local contrast was the primary indicator for ghost glands.\nThe proposed approach can automatically segment individual meibomian glands in infrared meibography images, identify ghost glands, and quantitatively analyze gland morphological features.", "Past studies have reported emotional intelligence (EI) as a relevant factor in development and maintenance of eating disorders (ED), as well as in increasing self-esteem and reducing anxiety. Similarly, research has showed that anxiety and self-esteem are positively and negatively associated to ED criteria, respectively. However, no prior studies have yet tested the multiple intervening roles of both self-esteem and anxiety as potential mediators of the association between EI and ED symptomatology. The present study aims to bridge these gaps by testing a sequential path model. Specifically, we examine the potential sequential mediation effects of self-esteem-anxiety on the link between EI and ED. A sample composed of 516 Spanish undergraduate students and community adults completed measures of EI, self-esteem, anxiety, and ED symptomatology. The results show that high levels of EI were positively associated with self-esteem and negatively associated with anxiety and ED symptoms. Anxiety was positively associated to ED symptoms, while self-esteem levels were negatively linked to ED symptoms. Moreover, path analyses showed that self-esteem and anxiety fully mediated the relationship between EI and ED symptoms in sequence. These findings suggest that EI plays a key role in reducing symptomatology of ED through increased self-esteem and reduced anxiety symptoms, providing novel evidence regarding psychological mechanisms through which EI contributes to a reduction of ED symptomatology. Implications for assessing and improving these psychological resources in ED preventive programs are discussed.", "Leadership during the emergence of the novel coronavirus pandemic is complex and involves coordinated efforts between multiple levels of leadership from the medical, installation, local, state, and federal levels. Medical intelligence is critical to successful pandemic threat mitigation. We describe one of the first coronavirus (Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19)) impacted Department of Defense Medical Treatment Facility's strategic activation of a COVID-19 Medical Intelligence Team (MIT), the products developed, and lessons learned during the pandemic onset. The MIT bridged COVID-19 knowledge and policy gaps by developing and delivering daily intelligence briefings on four domains: epidemiology and infectious disease, healthcare capabilities and infrastructure, policy and regulations, and diagnostics and therapeutic interventions. Twenty-three products were developed and delivered to aid in leadership decision-making and local policy development in the absence of higher-level policy and guidance. Employing MITs in future pandemic response strategy may more effectively mitigate pandemic threats and improve force health protection.", "With the overnight growth in Working from Home (WFH) owing to the pandemic, organisations and their employees have had to adapt work-related processes and practices quickly with a huge reliance upon technology. Everyday activities such as social interactions with colleagues must therefore be reconsidered. Existing literature emphasises that social interactions, typically conducted in the traditional workplace, are a fundamental feature of social life and shape employees' experience of work. This experience is completely removed for many employees due to the pandemic and, presently, there is a lack of knowledge on how individuals maintain social interactions with colleagues via technology when working from home. Given that a lack of social interaction can lead to social isolation and other negative repercussions, this study aims to contribute to the existing body of literature on remote working by highlighting employees' experiences and practices around social interaction with colleagues. This study takes an interpretivist and qualitative approach utilising the diary-keeping technique to collect data from twenty-nine individuals who had started to work from home on a full-time basis as a result of the pandemic. The study explores how participants conduct social interactions using different technology platforms and how such interactions are embedded in their working lives. The findings highlight the difficulty in maintaining social interactions via technology such as the absence of cues and emotional intelligence, as well as highlighting numerous other factors such as job uncertainty, increased workloads and heavy usage of technology that affect their work lives. The study also highlights that despite the negative experiences relating to working from home, some participants are apprehensive about returning to work in the traditional office place where social interactions may actually be perceived as a distraction. The main contribution of our study is to highlight that a variety of perceptions and feelings of how work has changed via an increased use of digital media while working from home exists and that organisations need to be aware of these differences so that they can be managed in a contextualised manner, thus increasing both the efficiency and effectiveness of working from home.", "The development of modern agriculture has prompted the greater input of herbicides, insecticides, and fertilizers. However, precision release and targeted delivery of these agrochemicals still remain a challenge. Here, a pesticide-fertilizer all-in-one combination (PFAC) strategy and deep learning are employed to form a system for controlled and targeted delivery of agrochemicals. This system mainly consists of three components: (1) hollow mesoporous silica (HMS), to encapsulate herbicides and phase-change material; (2) polydopamine (PDA) coating, to provide a photothermal effect; and (3) a zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF8), to provide micronutrient Zn2+ and encapsulate insecticides. Results show that the PFAC at concentration of 5 mg mL-1 reaches the phase transition temperature of 1-tetradecanol (37.5 \u00b0C) after 5 min of near-infrared (NIR) irradiation (800 nm, 0.5 W cm-2). The data of corn and weed are collected and relayed to deep learning algorithms for model building to realize object detection and further targeted weeding. In-field treatment results indicated that the growth of chicory herb was significantly inhibited when treated with the PFAC compared with the blank group after 24 h under NIR irradiation for 2 h. This system combines agrochemical innovation and artificial intelligence technology, achieves synergistic effects of weeding and insecticide and nutrient supply, and will potentially achieve precision and sustainable agriculture.", "We aimed to construct an artificial intelligence (AI) guided identification of suspicious bone metastatic lesions from the whole-body bone scintigraphy (WBS) images by convolutional neural networks (CNNs).\nWe retrospectively collected the 99mTc-MDP WBS images with confirmed bone lesions from 3352 patients with malignancy. 14,972 bone lesions were delineated manually by physicians and annotated as benign and malignant. The lesion-based differentiating performance of the proposed network was evaluated by fivefold cross validation, and compared with the other three popular CNN architectures for medical imaging. The average sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and the area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) were calculated. To delve the outcomes of this study, we conducted subgroup analyses, including lesion burden number and tumor type for the classifying ability of the CNN.\nIn the fivefold cross validation, our proposed network reached the best average accuracy (81.23%) in identifying suspicious bone lesions compared with InceptionV3 (80.61%), VGG16 (81.13%) and DenseNet169 (76.71%). Additionally, the CNN model's lesion-based average sensitivity and specificity were 81.30% and 81.14%, respectively. Based on the lesion burden numbers of each image, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was 0.847 in the few group (lesion number n\u2009\u2264\u20093), 0.838 in the medium group (n\u2009=\u20094-6), and 0.862 in the extensive group (n\u2009>\u20096). For the three major primary tumor types, the CNN-based lesion identifying AUC value was 0.870 for lung cancer, 0.900 for prostate cancer, and 0.899 for breast cancer.\nThe CNN model suggests potential in identifying suspicious benign and malignant bone lesions from whole-body bone scintigraphic images.", "Background An artificial intelligence model that assesses primary bone tumors on radiographs may assist in the diagnostic workflow. Purpose To develop a multitask deep learning (DL) model for simultaneous bounding box placement, segmentation, and classification of primary bone tumors on radiographs. Materials and Methods This retrospective study analyzed bone tumors on radiographs acquired prior to treatment and obtained from patient data from January 2000 to June 2020. Benign or malignant bone tumors were diagnosed in all patients by using the histopathologic findings as the reference standard. By using split-sample validation, 70% of the patients were assigned to the training set, 15% were assigned to the validation set, and 15% were assigned to the test set. The final performance was evaluated on an external test set by using geographic validation, with accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and 95% CIs being used for classification, the intersection over union (IoU) being used for bounding box placements, and the Dice score being used for segmentations. Results Radiographs from 934 patients (mean age, 33 years \u00b1 19 [standard deviation]; 419 women) were evaluated in the internal data set, which included 667 benign bone tumors and 267 malignant bone tumors. Six hundred fifty-four patients were in the training set, 140 were in the validation set, and 140 were in the test set. One hundred eleven patients were in the external test set. The multitask DL model achieved 80.2% (89 of 111; 95% CI: 72.8, 87.6) accuracy, 62.9% (22 of 35; 95% CI: 47, 79) sensitivity, and 88.2% (67 of 76; CI: 81, 96) specificity in the classification of bone tumors as malignant or benign. The model achieved an IoU of 0.52 \u00b1 0.34 for bounding box placements and a mean Dice score of 0.60 \u00b1 0.37 for segmentations. The model accuracy was higher than that of two radiologic residents (71.2% and 64.9%; P = .002 and P < .001, respectively) and was comparable with that of two musculoskeletal fellowship-trained radiologists (83.8% and 82.9%; P = .13 and P = .25, respectively) in classifying a tumor as malignant or benign. Conclusion The developed multitask deep learning model allowed for accurate and simultaneous bounding box placement, segmentation, and classification of primary bone tumors on radiographs. \u00a9 RSNA, 2021 Online supplemental material is available for this article. See also the editorial by Carrino in this issue.", "Numerous therapeutic strategies have been developed for osteoarthritis (OA) management, including intra-articular (IA) injections. The ideal IA formulation should control cartilage degradation and restore synovial fluid viscosity. To this end, we propose to combine thermo-sensitive polymers (poloxamers) with hyaluronic acid (HA) to develop suitable beta-lapachone (\u03b2Lap) loaded IA formulations. The development of IA formulations with these components entails several difficulties: low \u03b2Lap solubility, unknown \u03b2Lap therapeutic dose and the bonded commitment of easy administration and viscosupplementation. An optimized formulation was designed using artificial intelligence tools based on the experimental results of a wide variety of hydrogels and its therapeutic capacity was evaluated on an ex vivo OA model. The formulation presented excellent rheological properties and significantly decreased the secretion of degradative (MMP13) and pro-inflammatory (CXCL8) molecules. Therefore, the developed formulation is a promising candidate for OA treatment restoring the synovial fluid rheological properties while decreasing inflammation and cartilage degradation.", "Machine learning is a rapidly evolving field that offers physicians an innovative and comprehensive mechanism to examine various aspects of patient data. Cervical and lumbar degenerative spine disorders are commonly age-related disease processes that can utilize machine learning to improve patient outcomes with careful patient selection and intervention. The aim of this study is to examine the current applications of machine learning in cervical and lumbar degenerative spine disease. A systematic review was conducted using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. A search of PubMed, Embase, Medline, and Cochrane was conducted through May 31st, 2020, using the following terms: \"artificial intelligence\" OR \"machine learning\" AND \"neurosurgery\" AND \"spine.\" Studies were included if original research on machine learning was utilized in patient care for degenerative spine disease, including radiographic machine learning applications. Studies focusing on robotic applications in neurosurgery, navigation, or stereotactic radiosurgery were excluded. The literature search identified 296 papers, with 35 articles meeting inclusion criteria. There were nine studies involving cervical degenerative spine disease and 26 studies on lumbar degenerative spine disease. The majority of studies for both cervical and lumbar spines utilized machine learning for the prediction of postoperative outcomes, with 5 (55.6%) and 15 (61.5%) studies, respectively. Machine learning applications focusing on degenerative lumbar spine greatly outnumber the current volume of cervical spine studies. The current research in lumbar spine also demonstrates more advanced clinical applications of radiographic, diagnostic, and predictive machine learning models.", "The incorporation of patients' perspectives into drug discovery and development has become critically important from the viewpoint of accounting for modern-day business dynamics. There is a trend among patients to narrate their disease experiences on social media. The insights gained by analyzing the data pertaining to such social-media posts could be leveraged to support patient-centered drug development. Manual analysis of these data is nearly impossible, but artificial intelligence enables automated and cost-effective processing, also referred as social media mining (SMM). This paper discusses the fundamental SMM methods along with several relevant drug-development use cases.", "In current precision prostate cancer (PCa) surgery era the identification of the best patients candidate for prostate biopsy still remains an open issue. The aim of this study was to evaluate if the prostate target biopsy (TB) outcomes could be predicted by using artificial intelligence approach based on a set of clinical pre-biopsy.\nPre-biopsy characteristics in terms of PSA, PSA density, digital rectal examination (DRE), previous prostate biopsies, number of suspicious lesions at mp-MRI, lesion volume, lesion location, and Pi-Rads score were extracted from our prospectively maintained TB database from March 2014 to December 2019. Our approach is based on Fuzzy logic and associative rules mining, with the aim to predict TB outcomes.\nA total of 1448 patients were included. Using the Frequent-Pattern growth algorithm we extracted 875 rules and used to build the fuzzy classifier. 963 subjects were classified whereas for the remaining 484 subjects were not classified since no rules matched with their input variables. Analyzing the classified subjects we obtained a specificity of 59.2% and sensitivity of 90.8% with a negative and the positive predictive values of 81.3% and 76.6%, respectively. In particular, focusing on ISUP\u2009\u2265\u20093 PCa, our model is able to correctly predict the biopsy outcomes in 98.1% of the cases.\nIn this study we demonstrated that the possibility to look at several pre-biopsy variables simultaneously with artificial intelligence algorithms can improve the prediction of TB outcomes, outclassing the performance of PSA, its derivates and MRI alone.", "This study describes a method to assist the task of predicting the result of the decision-making process of an individual based on psychological and emotional aspects and using artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. This study presents indicators created for profile identification, which are organized in primary and circumstantial categories. These indicators are merged according to the ultimate purpose of profile identification, including the expected behavioral pattern for a person who performs a decision-making process. The person behavior hypothesis was successfully tested and can be approximated by an indicator such as mental functioning pattern, and the mental functioning pattern hypothesis can signal the most likely decisions of an individual. Four debtor decision variables were assessed in a debt negotiation process, in order to validate the method, which is applicable to other decision-making domains. The best signaling of the most likely decision of the debtor was seven times greater than that of a random prediction, while the gain of the worst decision signaling variable was 20%.", "We survey recent work in biomedical NLP on building more adaptable or generalizable models, with a focus on work dealing with electronic health record (EHR) texts, to better understand recent trends in this area and identify opportunities for future research.\nWe searched PubMed, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) anthology, the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) proceedings, and Google Scholar for the years 2018-2020. We reviewed abstracts to identify the most relevant and impactful work, and manually extracted data points from each of these papers to characterize the types of methods and tasks that were studied, in which clinical domains, and current state-of-the-art results.\nThe ubiquity of pre-trained transformers in clinical NLP research has contributed to an increase in domain adaptation and generalization-focused work that uses these models as the key component. Most recently, work has started to train biomedical transformers and to extend the fine-tuning process with additional domain adaptation techniques. We also highlight recent research in cross-lingual adaptation, as a special case of adaptation.\nWhile pre-trained transformer models have led to some large performance improvements, general domain pre-training does not always transfer adequately to the clinical domain due to its highly specialized language. There is also much work to be done in showing that the gains obtained by pre-trained transformers are beneficial in real world use cases. The amount of work in domain adaptation and transfer learning is limited by dataset availability and creating datasets for new domains is challenging. The growing body of research in languages other than English is encouraging, and more collaboration between researchers across the language divide would likely accelerate progress in non-English clinical NLP.", "Large and complex renal stones are usually treated with percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL). One of the crucial steps in this procedure is the access to the collecting system with the percutaneous puncture and this maneuver leads to a risk of vascular and neighboring organs' injury. In the last years, the application of virtual image-guided surgery has gained wide diffusion even in this specific field.\nTo provide a short overview of the most recent evidence on current applications of virtual imaging guidance for PCNL.\nA non-systematic review of the literature was performed. Medline, PubMed, the Cochrane Database and Embase were screened for studies regarding the use virtual imaging guidance for PCNL.\n3D virtual navigation technology for PCNL was first used in urology with the purpose of surgical training and surgical planning; subsequently, the field of surgical navigation with different modalities (from cognitive to augmented reality or mixed reality) had been explored. Finally, anecdotal preliminary experiences explored the potential application of artificial intelligence guidance for percutaneous puncture.\nNowadays, many experiences proved the potential benefit of virtual guidance for surgical simulation and training. Focusing on surgery, this tool revealed to be useful both for surgical planning, allowed to achieve a better surgical performance, and for surgical navigation by using augmented reality and mixed reality systems aimed to assist the surgeon in real time during the intervention.", "Traffic congestion has become common in urban areas worldwide. To solve this problem, the method of searching a solution using artificial intelligence has recently attracted widespread attention because it can solve complex problems such as traffic signal control. This study developed two traffic signal control models using reinforcement learning and a microscopic simulation-based evaluation for an isolated intersection and two coordinated intersections. To develop these models, a deep Q-network (DQN) was used, which is a promising reinforcement learning algorithm. The performance was evaluated by comparing the developed traffic signal control models in this research with the fixed-time signal optimized by Synchro model, which is a traffic signal optimization model. The evaluation showed that the developed traffic signal control model of the isolated intersection was validated, and the coordination of intersections was superior to that of the fixed-time signal control method.", "This article provides an up-to-date review of technological advances in 3 key areas related to diet monitoring and precision nutrition. First, we review developments in mobile applications, with a focus on food photography and artificial intelligence to facilitate the process of diet monitoring. Second, we review advances in 2 types of wearable and handheld sensors that can potentially be used to fully automate certain aspects of diet logging: physical sensors to detect moments of dietary intake, and chemical sensors to estimate the composition of diets and meals. Finally, we review new programs that can generate personalized/precision nutrition recommendations based on measurements of gut microbiota and continuous glucose monitors with artificial intelligence. The article concludes with a discussion of potential pitfalls of some of these technologies.", "Effective inclusive education is key in promoting the long-term outcomes of children with autism spectrum conditions (ASC). However, no concrete consensus exists to guide teacher-student interactions in the classroom. In this work, we explore the potential of artificial intelligence as an approach in autism education to assist teachers in effective practice in developing social and educational outcomes for children with ASC. We form a protocol to systematically capture such interactions, and conduct a statistical analysis to uncover basic patterns in the collected observations, including the longer-term effect of specific teacher communication strategies on student response. In addition, we deploy machine learning techniques to predict student response given the form of communication used by teachers under specific classroom conditions and in relation to specified student attributes. Our analysis, drawn on a sample of 5460 coded interactions between teachers and seven students, sheds light on the varying effectiveness of different communication strategies and demonstrates the potential of this approach in making a contribution to autism education.", "Zebrafish provide a unique opportunity for drug screening in living animals, with the fast-developing, transparent embryos allowing for relatively high-throughput, microscopy-based screens. However, the limited availability of rapid, flexible imaging and analysis platforms has limited the use of zebrafish in drug screens. We have developed an easy-to-use, customisable automated screening procedure suitable for high-throughput phenotype-based screens of live zebrafish. We utilised the WiScan\u00ae Hermes High Content Imaging System to rapidly acquire brightfield and fluorescent images of embryos, and the WiSoft\u00ae Athena Zebrafish Application for analysis, which harnesses an Artificial Intelligence-driven algorithm to automatically detect fish in brightfield images, identify anatomical structures, partition the animal into regions and exclusively select the desired side-oriented fish. Our initial validation combined structural analysis with fluorescence images to enumerate GFP-tagged haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells in the tails of embryos, which correlated with manual counts. We further validated this system to assess the effects of genetic mutations and X-ray irradiation in high content using a wide range of assays. Further, we performed simultaneous analysis of multiple cell types using dual fluorophores in high throughput. In summary, we demonstrate a broadly applicable and rapidly customisable platform for high-content screening in zebrafish. This article has an associated First Person interview with the first author of the paper.", "In this report, we give an overview of the proceedings from the online Imperial College London Neurotechnology Symposium 2020. The first part deals with the fundamentals of how artificial intelligence (AI) can be used to inform research frameworks used in the field of neurotechnology. The second part goes a level higher and shows how AI can be used in cutting-edge cellular and molecular methodologies and their applications. The final part focuses on the efforts to \"decode\" neural systems in brain-computer interfaces to advance neuroprosthetics.", "Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of mortality worldwide, with atherosclerotic coronary artery disease (CAD) accounting for the majority of cases. X-ray coronary angiography and computed tomography coronary angiography (CCTA) are the imaging modalities of choice for the assessment of CAD. However, the use of ionising radiation and iodinated contrast agents remain drawbacks. There is therefore a clinical need for an alternative modality for the early identification and longitudinal monitoring of CAD without these associated drawbacks. Coronary magnetic resonance angiography (CMRA) could be a potential alternative for the detection and monitoring of coronary arterial stenosis, without exposing patients to ionising radiation or iodinated contrast agents. Further advantages include its versatility, excellent soft tissue characterisation and suitability for repeat imaging. Despite the early promise of CMRA, widespread clinical utilisation remains limited due to long and unpredictable scan times, onerous scan planning, lower spatial resolution, as well as motion related image quality degradation. The past decade has brought about a resurgence in CMRA technology, with significant leaps in image acceleration, respiratory and cardiac motion estimation and advanced motion corrected or motion-resolved image reconstruction. With the advent of artificial intelligence, great advances are also seen in deep learning-based motion estimation, undersampled and super-resolution reconstruction promising further improvements of CMRA. This has enabled high spatial resolution (1 mm isotropic), 3D whole heart CMRA in a clinically feasible and reliable acquisition time of under 10 min. Furthermore, latest super-resolution image reconstruction approaches which are currently under evaluation promise acquisitions as short as 1 min. In this review, we will explore the recent technological advances that are designed to bring CMRA closer to clinical reality.", "Biological neuronal cells communicate using neurochemistry and electrical signals. The same phenomena also allow us to probe and manipulate neuronal systems and communicate with them. Neuronal system malfunctions cause a multitude of symptoms and functional deficiencies that can be assessed and sometimes alleviated by electrical stimulation. Our working hypothesis is that real-time closed-loop full-duplex measurement and stimulation paradigms can provide more in-depth insight into neuronal networks and enhance our capability to control diseases of the nervous system. In this study, we review extracellular electrical stimulation methods used in in vivo, in vitro, and in silico neuroscience research and in the clinic (excluding methods mainly aimed at neuronal growth and other similar effects) and highlight the potential of closed-loop measurement and stimulation systems. A multitude of electrical stimulation and measurement-based methods are widely used in research and the clinic. Closed-loop methods have been proposed, and some are used in the clinic. However, closed-loop systems utilizing more complex measurement analysis and adaptive stimulation systems, such as artificial intelligence systems connected to biological neuronal systems, do not yet exist. Our review promotes the research and development of intelligent paradigms aimed at meaningful communications between neuronal and information and communications technology systems, \"dialogical paradigms,\" which have the potential to take neuroscience and clinical methods to a new level.", "Hospital administrations and providers are more than ever in need for new technologies and innovative methods with clinical benefit at lower costs. Surgeons and clinicians depend on conventional risk stratification scores developed to allow physicians to establish the risk of perioperative mortality. However, the current practiced models of preventive cardiology largely depend on patient motivation and awareness to be able to apply such risk scores appropriately. It was not until the appearance of miniaturized pocket-sized, user-friendly digital technologies that the awareness started to grow, highlighting the importance of role of technology and artificial intelligence in modern-day medicine.", "Introduction Rapid influenza diagnostic tests (RIDTs) are considered essential for determining when to start influenza treatment using anti-influenza drugs, but their accuracy is about 70%. Under the COVID-19 pandemic, we hope to refrain from performing unnecessary RIDTs considering droplet infection of COVID-19 and influenza. We re-examined the medical questionnaire's importance and its relationship to the positivity of RIDTs. Then we built a positivity prediction model for RIDTs using automated artificial intelligence (AI). Methods We retrospectively investigated 96 patients who underwent RIDTs at the outpatient department from December 2019 to March 2020. We used a questionnaire sheet with 24 items\u00a0before conducting RIDTs. The factors associated with the positivity of RIDTs were statistically analyzed. We then used an automated AI framework to produce the positivity prediction model using the 24 items, sex, and age, with five-fold cross-validation. Results Of the 47 women and 49 men (median age was 39 years), 56 patients were RIDT\u00a0positive with influenza A. The AI-based model using 26 variables had an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.980. The stronger variables are subjective pretest probability, which is a numerically described score ranging from 0% to 100% of \"I think I have influenza,\" cough, past hours after the onset, muscle pain, and maximum body temperature in order. Conclusion We easily built the RIDT\u00a0positivity prediction model using automated AI. Its AUC was satisfactory, and it suggested the importance of a detailed medical interview. Both the univariate analysis and AI-based model suggested that subjective pretest probability, \"I think I have influenza,\" might be useful.", "Deficits in event-related potential (ERP) including duration mismatch negativity (MMN) and P3a have been demonstrated widely in chronic schizophrenia (SZ) but inconsistent findings were reported in first-episode patients. Psychotropic medications and diagnosis might contribute to different findings on MMN/P3a ERP in first-episode patients. The present study examined MMN and P3a in first episode drug na\u00efve SZ and bipolar disorder (BPD) patients and explored the relationships among ERPs, neurocognition and global functioning.\nTwenty SZ, 24 BPD and 49 age and sex-matched healthy controls were enrolled in this study. Data of clinical symptoms [Positive and Negative Symptoms Scale (PANSS), Young Manic Rating Scale (YMRS), Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD)], neurocognition [Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS), Cattell's Culture Fair Intelligence Test (CCFT), Delay Matching to Sample (DMS), Rapid Visual Information Processing (RVP)], and functioning [Functioning Assessment Short Test (FAST)] were collected. P3a and MMN were elicited using a passive auditory oddball paradigm.\nSignificant MMN and P3a deficits and impaired neurocognition were found in both SZ and BPD patients. In SZ, MMN was significantly correlated with FAST (r = 0.48) and CCFT (r = -0.31). In BPD, MMN was significantly correlated with DMS (r = -0.54). For P3a, RVP and FAST scores were significant predictors in SZ, whereas RVP, WAIS and FAST were significant predictors in BPD.\nThe present study found deficits in MMN, P3a, neurocognition in drug na\u00efve SZ and BPD patients. These deficits appeared to link with levels of higher-order cognition and functioning.", "Liveability is a multi-dimensional and hierarchical concept which consists of various criteria and sub-criteria and may be evaluated in different ways. The aim of this study was to systematically review indicators and methods used for the evaluation of urban liveability in literature.\nThe five-stage methodological framework of Arksey and O'Malley was used to conduct this scoping review. A systematic search of electronic databases, including Scopus, Medline (via PubMed), Embase, Web of Science and EBSCO was done until May 29, 2019. Web searching, searching reference lists and hand searching was also conducted to retrieve more relevant articles. Two reviewers screened the papers for eligibility based on the inclusion criteria and extracted their key data and reported them descriptively.\nSixty seven (67) out of 3,599 papers met the selection criteria. This review showed five distinct domains considered to be important components of liveability. These were Economical, Environmental, Institutional, Social, and Governance (Political) domains. The most important subdomains (indices) which were frequently applied in various studies were Environmental friendliness and Sustainability, Socio-Cultural Conditions and Economic Vibrancy and Competitiveness. We also identified seven different methodologies and six ranking tools used for assessing urban liveability. Among the quantitative methods, three methods accounted for 89.6% of the articles. These methods were the Analytical hierarchy process and entropy (AHP; n=24; 50%), Factor analysis & Principle Component Analysis (FA & PCA; n=12; 25%) and Spatial Multi-criteria Decision-making Method (Spatial; n=7; 14.6%). Among the ranking tools used, three ranking tools accounted for 65.4% of the articles. These tools were the Livable City Scientific Evaluation Standards (LCSES; n=9; 34.6%), The Global Liveable Cities Index (GLCI; n=4; 15.4%) and the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU; n=4; 15.4%).\nThis paper discusses and summarizes the latest indicators and methods used for determining urban liveability. The information offered in the review can help future investigators to decide which method suits their purpose and situation better and measure urban liveability more systematically than before.", "Natural language processing (NLP) is the subset of artificial intelligence focused on the computer interpretation of human language. It is an invaluable tool in the analysis, aggregation, and simplification of free text. It has already demonstrated significant potential in the analysis of radiology reports. There are abundant open-source libraries and tools available that facilitate its application to the benefit of radiology. Radiologists who understand its limitations and potential will be better positioned to evaluate NLP models, understand how they can improve clinical workflow, and facilitate research endeavors involving large amounts of human language. The advent of increasingly affordable and powerful computer processing, the large quantities of medical and radiologic data, and advances in machine learning algorithms have contributed to the large potential of NLP. In turn, radiology has significant potential to benefit from the ability of NLP to convert relatively standardized radiology reports to machine-readable data. NLP benefits from standardized reporting, but because of its ability to interpret free text by using context clues, NLP does not necessarily depend on it. An overview and practical approach to NLP is featured, with specific emphasis on its applications to radiology. A brief history of NLP, the strengths and challenges inherent to its use, and freely available resources and tools are covered to guide further exploration and study within the field. Particular attention is devoted to the recent development of the Word2Vec and BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) language models, which have exponentially increased the power and utility of NLP for a variety of applications. Online supplemental material is available for this article. \u00a9RSNA, 2021.", "Accurate prediction of any type of natural hazard is a challenging task. Of all the various hazards, drought prediction is challenging as it lacks a universal definition and is getting adverse with climate change impacting drought events both spatially and temporally. The problem becomes more complex as drought occurrence is dependent on a multitude of factors ranging from hydro-meteorological to climatic variables. A paradigm shift happened in this field when it was found that the inclusion of climatic variables in the data-driven prediction model improves the accuracy. However, this understanding has been primarily using statistical metrics used to measure the model accuracy. The present work tries to explore this finding using an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) model. The explainable deep learning model development and comparative analysis were performed using known understandings drawn from physical-based models. The work also tries to explore how the model achieves specific results at different spatio-temporal intervals, enabling us to understand the local interactions among the predictors for different drought conditions and drought periods. The drought index used in the study is Standard Precipitation Index (SPI) at 12\u00a0month scales applied for five different regions in New South Wales, Australia, with the explainable algorithm being SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). The conclusions drawn from SHAP plots depict the importance of climatic variables at a monthly scale and varying ranges of annual scale. We observe that the results obtained from SHAP align with the physical model interpretations, thus suggesting the need to add climatic variables as predictors in the prediction model.", "We argue that cognitive models can provide a common ground between human users and deep reinforcement learning (Deep RL) algorithms for purposes of explainable artificial intelligence (AI). Casting both the human and learner as cognitive models provides common mechanisms to compare and understand their underlying decision-making processes. This common grounding allows us to identify divergences and explain the learner's behavior in human understandable terms. We present novel salience techniques that highlight the most relevant features in each model's decision-making, as well as examples of this technique in common training environments such as Starcraft II and an OpenAI gridworld.", "Deep learning-based MRI diagnosis of internal joint derangement is an emerging field of artificial intelligence, which offers many exciting possibilities for musculoskeletal radiology. A variety of investigational deep learning algorithms have been developed to detect anterior cruciate ligament tears, meniscus tears, and rotator cuff disorders. Additional deep learning-based MRI algorithms have been investigated to detect Achilles tendon tears, recurrence prediction of musculoskeletal neoplasms, and complex segmentation of nerves, bones, and muscles. Proof-of-concept studies suggest that deep learning algorithms may achieve similar diagnostic performances when compared to human readers in meta-analyses; however, musculoskeletal radiologists outperformed most deep learning algorithms in studies including a direct comparison. Earlier investigations and developments of deep learning algorithms focused on the binary classification of the presence or absence of an abnormality, whereas more advanced deep learning algorithms start to include features for characterization and severity grading. While many studies have focused on comparing deep learning algorithms against human readers, there is a paucity of data on the performance differences of radiologists interpreting musculoskeletal MRI studies without and with artificial intelligence support. Similarly, studies demonstrating the generalizability and clinical applicability of deep learning algorithms using realistic clinical settings with workflow-integrated deep learning algorithms are sparse. Contingent upon future studies showing the clinical utility of deep learning algorithms, artificial intelligence may eventually translate into clinical practice to assist detection and characterization of various conditions on musculoskeletal MRI exams.", "Quantitative ultrasound (QUS) imaging is a safe, reliable, inexpensive, and real-time technique to extract physically descriptive parameters for assessing pathologies. Compared with other major imaging modalities such as computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, QUS suffers from several major drawbacks: poor image quality and inter- and intra-observer variability. Therefore, there is a great need to develop automated methods to improve the image quality of QUS. In recent years, there has been increasing interest in artificial intelligence (AI) applications in medical imaging, and a large number of research studies in AI in QUS have been conducted. The purpose of this review is to describe and categorize recent research into AI applications in QUS. We first introduce the AI workflow and then discuss the various AI applications in QUS. Finally, challenges and future potential AI applications in QUS are discussed.", "Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) formula is widely used for thousands of years in clinical practice. With the development of artificial intelligence, deep learning models may help doctors prescribe reasonable formulas. Meanwhile, current studies of formula recommendation only focus on the observable clinical symptoms and lack of molecular information. Here, inspired by the theory of TCM network pharmacology, we propose an intelligent formula recommendation system based on deep learning (FordNet), fusing the information of phenotype and molecule. We collected more than 20,000 electronic health records from TCM Master Li Jiren's experience from 2013 to March 2020. In the FordNet system, the feature of diagnosis description is extracted by convolution neural network and the feature of TCM formula is extracted by network embedding, which fusing the molecular information. A hierarchical sampling strategy for data augmentation is designed to effectively learn training samples. Based on the expanded samples, a deep neural network based quantitative optimization model is developed for TCM formula recommendation. FordNet performs significantly better than baseline methods (hit ratio of top 10 improved by 46.9% compared with the best baseline random forest method). Moreover, the molecular information helps FordNet improve 17.3% hit ratio compared with the model using only macro information. Clinical evaluation shows that FordNet can well learn the effective experience of TCM Master and obtain excellent recommendation results. Our study, for the first time, proposes an intelligent recommendation system for TCM formula integrating phenotype and molecule information, which has potential to improve clinical diagnosis and treatment, and promote the shift of TCM research pattern from \"experience based, macro\" to \"data based, macro-micro combined\" as well as the development of TCM network pharmacology.", "As the initial stage in the formation of human intelligence, the sensory-memory system plays a critical role for human being to perceive, interact, and evolve with the environment. Electronic implementation of such biological sensory-memory system empowers the development of environment-interactive artificial intelligence (AI) that can learn and evolve with diversified external information, which could potentially broaden the application of the AI technology in the field of human-computer interaction. Here, we report a multimodal artificial sensory-memory system consisting of sensors for generating biomimetic visual, auditory, tactile inputs, and flexible carbon nanotube synaptic transistor that possesses synapse-like signal processing and memorizing behaviors. The transduction of physical signals into information-containing, presynaptic action potentials and the synaptic plasticity of the transistor in response to single and long-term action potential excitations have been systematically characterized. The bioreceptor-like sensing and synapse-like memorizing behaviors have also been demonstrated. On the basis of the memory and learning characteristics of the sensory-memory system, the well-known psychological model describing human memory, the \"multistore memory\" model, and the classical conditioning experiment that demonstrates the associative learning of brain, \"Pavlov's dog's experiment\", have both been implemented electronically using actual physical input signals as the sources of the stimuli. The biomimetic intelligence demonstrated in this neurological sensory-memory system shows its potential in promoting the advancement in multimodal, user-environment interactive AI.", "To summarize key contributions to current research in the field of Clinical Research Informatics (CRI) and to select best papers published in 2020.\nA bibliographic search using a combination of Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) descriptors and free-text terms on CRI was performed using PubMed, followed by a double-blind review in order to select a list of candidate best papers to be then peer-reviewed by external reviewers. After peer-review ranking, a consensus meeting between two section editors and the editorial team was organized to finally conclude on the selected four best papers.\nAmong the 877 papers published in 2020 and returned by the search, there were four best papers selected. The first best paper describes a method for mining temporal sequences from clinical documents to infer disease trajectories and enhancing high-throughput phenotyping. The authors of the second best paper demonstrate that the generation of synthetic Electronic Health Record (EHR) data through Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) could be substantially improved by more appropriate training and evaluation criteria. The third best paper offers an efficient advance on methods to detect adverse drug events by computer-assisting expert reviewers with annotated candidate mentions in clinical documents. The large-scale data quality assessment study reported by the fourth best paper has clinical research informatics implications, in terms of the trustworthiness of inferences made from analysing electronic health records.\nThe most significant research efforts in the CRI field are currently focusing on data science with active research in the development and evaluation of Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML) algorithms based on ever more intensive use of real-world data and especially EHR real or synthetic data. A major lesson that the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has already taught the scientific CRI community is that timely international high-quality data-sharing and collaborative data analysis is absolutely vital to inform policy decisions.", "Neuromorphic engineering, a methodology for emulating synaptic functions or neural systems, has attracted tremendous attention for achieving next-generation artificial intelligence technologies in the field of electronics and photonics. However, to emulate human visual memory, an active pixel sensor array for neuromorphic photonics has yet to be demonstrated, even though it can implement an artificial neuron array in hardware because individual pixels can act as artificial neurons. Here, we present a neuromorphic active pixel image sensor array (NAPISA) chip based on an amorphous oxide semiconductor heterostructure, emulating the human visual memory. In the 8 \u00d7 8 NAPISA chip, each pixel with a select transistor and a neuromorphic phototransistor is based on a solution-processed indium zinc oxide back channel layer and sputtered indium gallium zinc oxide front channel layer. These materials are used as a triggering layer for persistent photoconductivity and a high-performance channel layer with outstanding uniformity. The phototransistors in the pixels exhibit both photonic potentiation and depression characteristics by a constant negative and positive gate bias due to charge trapping/detrapping. The visual memory and forgetting behaviors of the NAPISA can be successfully demonstrated by using the pulsed light stencil method without any software or simulation. This study provides valuable information to other neuromorphic devices and systems for next-generation artificial intelligence technologies.", "Melanoma, one of the most dangerous types of skin cancer, results in a very high mortality rate. Early detection and resection are two key points for a successful cure. Recent researches have used artificial intelligence to classify melanoma and nevus and to compare the assessment of these algorithms to that of dermatologists. However, training neural networks on an imbalanced dataset leads to imbalanced performance, the specificity is very high but the sensitivity is very low. This study proposes a method for improving melanoma prediction on an imbalanced dataset by reconstructed appropriate CNN architecture and optimized algorithms. The contributions involve three key features as custom loss function, custom mini-batch logic, and reformed fully connected layers. In the experiment, the training dataset is kept up to date including 17,302 images of melanoma and nevus which is the largest dataset by far. The model performance is compared to that of 157 dermatologists from 12 university hospitals in Germany based on the same dataset. The experimental results prove that our proposed approach outperforms all 157 dermatologists and achieves higher performance than the state-of-the-art approach with area under the curve of 94.4%, sensitivity of 85.0%, and specificity of 95.0%. Moreover, using the best threshold shows the most balanced measure compare to other researches, and is promisingly application to medical diagnosis, with sensitivity of 90.0% and specificity of 93.8%. To foster further research and allow for replicability, we made the source code and data splits of all our experiments publicly available.", "The effect of an unguided internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) stress management program on depression may be enhanced by applying artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to guide participants adopting the program.\nThe aim of this study is to describe a research protocol to investigate the effect of a newly developed iCBT stress management program adopting AI technologies on improving depression among healthy workers during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThis study is a two-arm, parallel, randomized controlled trial. Participants (N=1400) will be recruited, and those who meet the inclusion criteria will be randomly allocated to the intervention or control (treatment as usual) group. A 6-week, six-module, internet-based stress management program, SMART-CBT, has been developed that includes machine-guided exercises to help participants acquire CBT skills, and it applies machine learning and deep learning technologies. The intervention group will participate in the program for 10 weeks. The primary outcome, depression, will be measured using the Beck Depression Inventory II at baseline and 3- and 6-month follow-ups. A mixed model repeated measures analysis will be used to test the intervention effect (group \u00d7 time interactions) in the total sample (universal prevention) on an intention-to-treat basis.\nThe study was at the stage of recruitment of participants at the time of submission.

Although the virus and its interaction with the host have been thoroughly characterized, effective treatment regimens beyond symptom-based care and repurposed therapeutics could not be identified. Various countries have successfully developed vaccines to curb the disease-transmission and prevent future outbreaks. Vaccination-drives are being conducted on a war-footing, but the process is time-consuming, especially in the densely populated regions of the world. Bioinformaticians and computational biologists have been playing an efficient role in this state of emergency to escalate clinical research and therapeutic development. However, there are not many reviews available in the literature concerning COVID-19 and its management. Hence, we have focused on designing a comprehensive review on in-silico approaches concerning COVID-19 to discuss the relevant bioinformatics and computational resources, tools, patterns of research, outcomes generated so far and their future implications to efficiently model data based on epidemiology; identify drug targets to design new drugs; predict epitopes for vaccine design and conceptualize diagnostic models.

Smart healthcare cyber physical systems are the future systems as they integrate the physical and cyber world for efficient functioning of medical processes and treatment through external monitoring and control of patients, medical devices and equipment for continuous communication and information exchange of physiological data. Technologies like Internet of Things, Machine learning and Artificial Intelligence have given birth to smart cyber physical systems like Smart Healthcare Systems, Smart Homes, Smart Vehicular Systems and Smart Grid. Such systems are interdisciplinary in nature with multitude of technologies contributing to its effective working.

A class of cycloarenes called kekulenes have been the focus of several experimental and theoretical studies from the stand point of aromaticity, superaromaticity, chirality, and novel electrical and magnetic properties. In the present study, we investigate the entropies and topological characterization of different tessellations of kekulenes through topological computations of superaromatic structures with pores. We introduce the self-powered vertex degree-based topological indices and then derive the graph entropy measures for three different tessellations (zigzag, armchair, and rectangular) via various molecular descriptors that we derive here. Several applications to computing the molecular properties are pointed out. We demonstrate the existence of isentropic and yet nonisomorphic tessellations of kekulenes for the first time. The two tessellations are predicted to be quite close in energy with comparable energy gaps. Graph theory-based PPP methods with parameters derived from higher levels of theory are proposed to be promising tools for the predictions of relative stabilities of kekulene tessellations. We show that the developed techniques can be applied in the general context of artificial intelligence for the machine generation of nuclear magnetic resonance and electron spin resonance spectroscopic patterns as well as in robust computations of thermochemistry of a large combinatorial libraries of tessellations of kekulenes through the generation of bond-equivalence classes.", "Due to recent technological innovations, digital health is quickly transforming the means of healthcare delivery. Technologies such as artificial intelligence, wearables and virtual consultations are increasingly being integrated into routine clinical care and with careful consideration; these promise to bring improvements to both professional workloads and patient outcomes. We highlight the need for dedicated digital health education in order to ensure appropriate use of patient data, patient safeguarding and the means by which we might incorporate this in a post-covid COVID curriculum. We comment on what can be learnt by Barts X Medicine, the first digital health programme in England to be integrated into the medical curriculum, to improve medical teaching.", "Our goal was to examine the relationship between biological and sociocultural factors that predict utilitarian moral judgment. Utilitarian moral judgments occur when a specific action is based on the outcome rather than its consistency with social norms. We predicted that (1) individuals with higher levels of dopamine will make more utilitarian decisions and (2) individuals who express greater religiosity will make less utilitarian judgments. We measured dopamine using spontaneous eyeblink rate, an indirect measure associated with striatal dopaminergic transmission. A total of 96 participants completed a utilitarian moral judgment task where they made judgments regarding nonmoral, impersonal, personal low-conflict, and personal high-conflict moral dilemmas. Then, participants completed a questionnaire measuring religiosity. We found a negative relationship between religiosity and the proportion of \"yes\" judgments participants made in the high-conflict personal dilemmas, which was consistent with our second hypothesis. None of our other hypotheses were supported. Understanding biological and cultural factors that relate to utilitarian moral judgment may also help in developing artificial intelligence that more closely mimic human behavior.", "A problem is a situation in which an agent seeks to attain a given goal without knowing how to achieve it. Human problem solving is typically studied as a search in a problem space composed of states (information about the environment) and operators (to move between states). A problem such as playing a game of chess has  10 120 $10^{120}$  possible states, and a traveling salesperson problem with as little as 82 cities already has more than  10 120 $10^{120}$  different tours (similar to chess). Biological neurons are slower than the digital switches in computers. An exhaustive search of the problem space exceeds the capacity of current computers for most interesting problems, and it is fairly clear that humans cannot in their lifetime exhaustively search even small fractions of these problem spaces. Yet, humans play chess and solve logistical problems of similar complexity on a daily basis. Even for simple problems humans do not typically engage in exploring even a small fraction of the problem space. This begs the question: How do humans solve problems on a daily basis in a fast and efficient way? Recent work suggests that humans build a problem representation and solve the represented problem-not the problem that is out there. The problem representation that is built and the process used to solve it are constrained by limits of cognitive capacity and a cost-benefit analysis discounting effort and reward. In this article, we argue that better understanding the way humans represent and solve problems using heuristics can help inform how simpler algorithms and representations can be used in artificial intelligence to lower computational complexity, reduce computation time, and facilitate real-time computation in complex problem\u00a0solving.", "This paper examines how haptic technology, virtual reality, and artificial intelligence help to reduce the physical contact in medical training during the COVID-19 Pandemic. Notably, any mistake made by the trainees during the education process might lead to undesired complications for the patient. Therefore, training of the medical skills to the trainees have always been a challenging issue for the expert surgeons, and this is even more challenging in pandemics. The current method of surgery training needs the novice surgeons to attend some courses, watch some procedure, and conduct their initial operations under the direct supervision of an expert surgeon. Owing to the requirement of physical contact in this method of medical training, the involved people including the novice and expert surgeons confront a potential risk of infection to the virus. This survey paper reviews recent technological breakthroughs along with new areas in which assistive technologies might provide a viable solution to reduce the physical contact in the medical institutes during the COVID-19 pandemic and similar crises.", "Cultural heritage images are among the primary media for communicating and preserving the cultural values of a society. The images represent concrete and abstract content and symbolise the social, economic, political, and cultural values of the society. However, an enormous amount of such values embedded in the images is left unexploited partly due to the absence of methodological and technical solutions to capture, represent, and exploit the latent information. With the emergence of new technologies and availability of cultural heritage images in digital formats, the methodology followed to semantically enrich and utilise such resources become a vital factor in supporting users need. This paper presents a methodology proposed to unearth the cultural information communicated via cultural digital images by applying Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies (such as Computer Vision (CV) and semantic web technologies). To this end, the paper presents a methodology that enables efficient analysis and enrichment of a large collection of cultural images covering all the major phases and tasks. The proposed method is applied and tested using a case study on cultural image collections from the Europeana platform. The paper further presents the analysis of the case study, the challenges, the lessons learned, and promising future research areas on the topic.", "As edge computing platforms need low power consumption and small volume circuit with artificial intelligence (AI), we design a compact and stable memristive visual geometry group (MVGG) neural network for image classification. According to characteristics of matrix-vector multiplication (MVM) using memristor crossbars, we design three pruning methods named row pruning, column pruning, and parameter distribution pruning. With a loss of only 0.41% of the classification accuracy, a pruning rate of 36.87% is obtained. In the MVGG circuit, both the batch normalization (BN) layers and dropout layers are combined into the memristive convolutional computing layer for decreasing the computing amount of the memristive neural network. In order to further reduce the influence of multistate conductance of memristors on classification accuracy of MVGG circuit, the layer optimization circuit and the channel optimization circuit are designed in this article. The theoretical analysis shows that the introduction of the optimized methods can greatly reduce the impact of the multistate conductance of memristors on the classification accuracy of MVGG circuits. Circuit simulation experiments show that, for the layer-optimized MVGG circuit, when the number of multistate conductance of memristors is 25 = 32 , the optimized circuit can basically achieve an accuracy of the full-precision MVGG. For the channel-optimized MVGG circuit, when the number of multistate conductance of memristors is 22 = 4 , the optimized circuit can basically achieve an accuracy of the full-precision MVGG.", "The new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is spreading rapidly around the world. Artificial Intelligence (AI) assisted identification and detection of diseases is an effective method of medical diagnosis.\nTo present recent advances in AI-assisted diagnosis of COVID-19, we introduce major aspects of AI in the process of diagnosing COVID-19.\nIn this paper, we firstly cover the latest collection and processing methods of datasets of COVID-19. The processing methods mainly include building public datasets, transfer learning, unsupervised learning and weakly supervised learning, semi-supervised learning methods and so on. Secondly, we introduce the algorithm application and evaluation metrics of AI in medical imaging segmentation and automatic screening. Then, we introduce the quantification and severity assessment of infection in COVID-19 patients based on image segmentation and automatic screening. Finally, we analyze and point out the current AI-assisted diagnosis of COVID-19 problems, which may provide useful clues for future work.\nAI is critical for COVID-19 diagnosis. Combining chest imaging with AI can not only save time and effort, but also provide more accurate and efficient medical diagnosis results.", "This research paper aims to discover the elements of good physician leadership as perceived by physicians and to find out how the findings connect to the leadership theory.\nThe subjects (n = 50) of this qualitative study are physicians from four hierarchical levels (residents/specialising physicians, specialists, heads of departments and chief physicians). Content analysis with a constructivist-interpretative approach by thematisation was the chosen method, and it was also analysed how major leadership theories relate to good physician leadership.\nPhysician leaders are expected to possess the professional skills of physicians, understand how the work affects physicians' lives and be competent in applying suitable leadership approaches following different situations and people. Trust, fairness, empathy, social skills, two-way communication skills, regular feedback, collegial respect and emotional intelligence are expected. As medical expertise connects leaders and followers, success in medical leadership comes from credibility in medical expertise, making medical leadership an inseparable part of good physician leadership. Subordinates are physician colleagues, who have their informal leadership roles on their hierarchical levels, making physician leadership a multidimensional leadership setting wherein formal leaders lead informal leaders, which blurs the traditional leader-follower boundary. In summary, good physician leadership is leadership through medical expertise combined with good manners, collegiality and traits from different kinds of leadership theories.\nThis study discovers elements of good physician leadership in a Finnish health-care context in which no similar prior empirical research has been carried out.", "To highlight the recent literature on artificial intelligence (AI) pertaining to otological imaging and to discuss future directions, obstacles and opportunities.\nThe main themes in the recent literature centre around automated otoscopic image diagnosis and automated image segmentation for application in virtual reality surgical simulation and planning. Other applications that have been studied include identification of tinnitus MRI biomarkers, facial palsy analysis, intraoperative augmented reality systems, vertigo diagnosis and endolymphatic hydrops ratio calculation in Meniere's disease. Studies are presently at a preclinical, proof-of-concept stage.\nThe recent literature on AI in otological imaging is promising and demonstrates the future potential of this technology in automating certain imaging tasks in a healthcare environment of ever-increasing demand and workload. Some studies have shown equivalence or superiority of the algorithm over physicians, albeit in narrowly defined realms. Future challenges in developing this technology include the compilation of large high quality annotated datasets, fostering strong collaborations between the health and technology sectors, testing the technology within real-world clinical pathways and bolstering trust among patients and physicians in this new method of delivering healthcare.", "Due to the excessive use of raw materials in diagnostic tools and equipment during the COVID-19 pandemic, there is a dire need for cheaper and more effective methods in the healthcare system. With the development of artificial intelligence (AI) methods in medical sciences as low-cost and safer diagnostic methods, researchers have turned their attention to the use of imaging tools with AI that have fewer complications for patients and reduce the consumption of healthcare resources. Despite its limitations, X-ray is suggested as the first-line diagnostic modality for detecting and screening COVID-19 cases.\nThis systematic review assessed the current state of AI applications and the performance of algorithms in X-ray image analysis. The search strategy yielded 322 results from four databases and google scholar, 60 of which met the inclusion criteria. The performance statistics included the area under the receiver operating characteristics (AUC) curve, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity.\nThe average sensitivity and specificity of CXR equipped with AI algorithms for COVID-19 diagnosis were >96% (83%-100%) and 92% (80%-100%), respectively. For common X-ray methods in COVID-19 detection, these values were 0.56 (95% CI 0.51-0.60) and 0.60 (95% CI 0.54-0.65), respectively. AI has substantially improved the diagnostic performance of X-rays in COVID-19.\nX-rays equipped with AI can serve as a tool to screen the cases requiring CT scans. The use of this tool does not waste time or impose extra costs, has minimal complications, and can thus decrease or remove unnecessary CT slices and other healthcare resources.", "Aesthetic-musical awareness demarcates a person's own perception of their ability to connect with music and the emotions it evokes. This may imply a benefit for the affective state of the individual. Therefore, the aim of this study was to observe whether there are statistically significant differences in emotional intelligence, perceived academic self-efficacy, and perfectionistic automatic thoughts when there are high and low scores in aesthetic-musical awareness in late adolescence. Likewise, we also aimed to determine whether emotional intelligence, perceived academic self-efficacy, and perfectionistic automatic thoughts are predictors of high aesthetic-musical awareness. To this end, a sample of 798 Spanish students between 17 and 23 years of age (M age = 18.5 years) was used. Statistically significant differences were found for the dimensions of each variable when there were high and low scores in aesthetic-musical awareness (scores between d = -0.31 and -0.40), with higher mean scores for emotional intelligence, perceived academic self-efficacy, and perfectionistic automatic thoughts being present in the group with high aesthetic-musical awareness. Likewise, it was observed that the probability of presenting high scores in aesthetic-musical awareness was higher when there was an increase in emotional intelligence, perceived academic self-efficacy, and perceived automatic thoughts. In conclusion, the results found demonstrate that both emotional intelligence, perceived academic self-efficacy, and the presence of perfectionistic automatic thoughts influence on whether an individual has greater aesthetic-musical awareness. Taking into account previous studies that show how music influences the well-being of the person, these findings show a favorable link for the design of programs that benefit the emotional state of adolescents.", "Technological advancement has led to an increase in the number and type of trading venues and a diversification of goods traded. These changes have re-emphasized the importance of understanding the effects of market competition: does proliferation of trading venues and increased competition lead to dominance of a single market or coexistence of multiple markets? In this paper, we address these questions in a stylized model of zero-intelligence traders who make repeated decisions at which of three available markets to trade. We analyse the model numerically and analytically and find that the traders' decision parameters-memory length and how strongly decisions are based on past success-make the key difference between consolidated and fragmented steady states of the population of traders. All three markets coexist with equal shares of traders only when either learning is too weak and traders choose randomly, or when markets are identical. In the latter case, the population of traders fragments across the markets. With different markets, we note that market dominance is the more typical scenario. Overall we show that, contrary to previous research emphasizing the role of traders' heterogeneity, market coexistence can emerge simply as a consequence of co-adaptation of an initially homogeneous population of traders.", "Medical artificial intelligence (MAI) creates an opportunity to radically expand access to healthcare across the globe by allowing us to overcome the persistent labor shortages that limit healthcare access. This democratization of healthcare is the greatest moral promise of MAI. Whatever comes of the enthusiastic discourse about the ability of MAI to improve the state-of-the-art in high-income countries (HICs), it will be far less impactful than improving the desperate state-of-the-actual in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). However, the almost exclusive development of MAI in HICs risks this promise being thwarted by contextual bias, an algorithmic bias that arises when the context of the training data is significantly dissimilar from potential contexts of application, which makes the unreflective application of HIC-based MAI in LMIC contexts dangerous. The use of MAI in LMICs demands careful attention to context. In this paper, I aim to provide that attention. First, I illustrate the dire state of healthcare in LMICs and the hope that MAI may help us to improve this state. Next, I show that the radical differences between the health contexts of HICs and those of LMICs create an extraordinary risk of contextual bias. Then, I explore ethical challenges raised by this risk, and propose policies that will help to overcome those challenges. Finally, I sketch a wide range of related issues that need to be addressed to ensure that MAI has a positive impact on LMICs-and is able to improve, rather than worsen, global health equity.", "Streamflow (Qflow) prediction is one of the essential steps for the reliable and robust water resources planning and management. It is highly vital for hydropower operation, agricultural planning, and flood control. In this study, the convolution neural network (CNN) and Long-Short-term Memory network (LSTM) are combined to make a new integrated model called CNN-LSTM to predict the hourly Qflow (short-term) at Brisbane River and Teewah Creek, Australia. The CNN layers were used to extract the features of Qflow time-series, while the LSTM networks use these features from CNN for Qflow time series prediction. The proposed CNN-LSTM model is benchmarked against the standalone model CNN, LSTM, and Deep Neural Network models and several conventional artificial intelligence (AI) models. Qflow prediction is conducted for different time intervals with the length of 1-Week, 2-Weeks, 4-Weeks, and 9-Months, respectively. With the help of different performance metrics and graphical analysis visualization, the experimental results reveal that with small residual error between the actual and predicted Qflow, the CNN-LSTM model outperforms all the benchmarked conventional AI models as well as ensemble models for all the time intervals. With 84% of Qflow prediction error below the range of 0.05 m3\u00a0s-1, CNN-LSTM demonstrates a better performance compared to 80% and 66% for LSTM and DNN, respectively. In summary, the results reveal that the proposed CNN-LSTM model based on the novel framework yields more accurate predictions. Thus, CNN-LSTM has significant practical value in Qflow prediction.", "This paper introduces a multi-faceted security methodology based on Holism, Ambient Intelligence, Triangulation, and Stigmergy (HATS) to combat the spread of current pandemics such as fake news and COVID-19. HATS leverages the apparent complementarity and similarity of physical and mental pandemics using adversarial learning and transduction to promote immunity on both using conformal prediction and principled symbiosis. As such, HATS confronts both mental and physical adversity found in misinformation and disinformation. It confers herd immunity using holism and triangulation that call to advantage on sensitivity analysis using open set transduction and meta-reasoning. Ambient intelligence and stigmergy further mediate meta-reasoning and re-identification in building and sharing immunity. As change is constant and everything is fluid, as truth is not always reality and reality is not always truth, and as truth is imponderable and lie can become truth, two things have to happen. First, reconditioning and reconfiguration engage random deficiency to discern familiarity from strangeness and a-typicality. Second, transfer learning using trans-adaptation and transposition, serve adaptation and interoperability. Together, this empowers open set transduction in facing adaptive persistent threats such as deception and denial when it engages moving target defense using modification and de-identification. Immunology and security further come together using to advantage the coupling of active and adversarial learning.", "Intelligence quotient (IQ) is commonly measured in child development studies, while adaptive behavior is less frequently considered. Given its associations with functional outcomes in children with neurodevelopmental disabilities, adaptive behavior may be a useful outcome in general population samples, as well. This study aimed to compare social and environmental correlates of adaptive behavior vs. IQ in a sample of preschoolers exposed to the Flint water crisis (N = 184). Mother-child dyads were recruited from the community and administered a comprehensive battery to obtain information about child neurodevelopmental functioning, including direct assessment of IQ via the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence and assessment of parent-reported adaptive functioning via the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales. Multiple social environmental factors were explored as potential correlates of child outcomes (i.e., IQ and adaptive behavior), and robust correlates were identified using a data-driven approach [i.e., least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression]. We then examined associations between the LASSO-selected predictors and IQ and adaptive behavior while controlling for child age, child sex, and maternal age. Children in this sample showed relative strength in adaptive behaviors, with scores in the adequate range, while average IQs fell in the low-average range. Adaptive behavior was significantly associated with maternal nurturance practices, while IQ was associated with the maternal education level. Implications for the use of adaptive behavior as an outcome measure in studies of children at an increased risk for neurodevelopmental problems are discussed.", "The connectome of the brain has a great impact on the function of the brain as the structure of the connectome affects the speed and efficiency of information transfer. As a highly energy-consuming organ, an efficient network structure is essential. A previous study has shown consistent overall brain connectivity across a large variety of species. This connectivity conservation was explained by a balance between interhemispheric and intrahemispheric connections; that is, spices with highly connected hemispheres appear to have weaker interhemisphere connections. This study examines this connectivity trade-off in the human brain using diffusion-based tractography and network analysis in the Human Connectome Project (970 subjects, 527 female). We explore the biological origins of this phenomenon, heritability, and the effect on cognitive measures.The proportion of commissural fibers in the brain had a negative correlation to hemispheric efficiency, pointing to a trade-off between inner hemispheric and interhemispheric connectivity. Network hubs including anterior and middle cingulate cortex, superior frontal areas, medial occipital areas, the parahippocampal gyrus, post- and precentral gyri, and the precuneus had the strongest contribution to this phenomenon. Other results show a high heritability as well as a strong connection to crystalized intelligence. This work presents cohort-based network analysis research, spanning a large variety of samples and exploring the overall architecture of the human connectome. Our results show a connectivity conservation phenomenon at the base of the overall brain network architecture. This network structure may explain much of the functional, behavioral, and cognitive variability among different brains.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The network structure of the brain is at the basis of every brain function as it dictates the characteristics of information transfer. Understanding the patterns and mechanisms that guide the connectome structure is crucial to understanding the brain itself. Here we unravel the mechanism at the base of the connectivity conservation phenomenon by exploring the interaction between hemispheric and commissural connectivity in a large-scale cohort-based connectivity study. We describe the trade-off between the two components and examine the origins of the trade-off and observe the effect on cognitive abilities and behavior.", "Today, one of the most challenging duties of nursing school is achieving clinical practice proficiency. Emotional intelligence correlates with students' clinical practice performance. Such data are scarce in Southwest Ethiopia. Therefore, this study aimed to examine the relationship between emotional intelligence and clinical performance of undergraduate nursing students during obstetrics and gynecology nursing practice.\nA cross-sectional study was employed. All registered 186 fourth-year undergraduate nursing students of Mizan-Tepi University were included in the study. The data were collected using the self-administered structured questionnaires after briefly explaining the objective of the study. The Schutte Self Report Emotional Intelligence Test (SSEIT) was used to collect the data associated with emotional intelligence. Independent t-test, Pearson correlation, linear regression, and ANOVA were computed as appropriate after checking all necessary assumptions and statistical significance was declared at p<0.05.\nEmotional intelligence was strongly correlated with clinical practice performance [r (186) =0.767, p<0.0001]. There was a statistically significant difference in the mean clinical practice performance by sex, where males were performed better [t(186)=3.27, p<0.0001]. Linear regression analysis showed that emotional intelligence was the only predictor of clinical practice performance (\u03b2=0.219, p<0.0001). In one way ANOVA, the Welch test [FW (3,182) = 218.18, p <0.0001] and the Brown-Forsythe test [FBF (3,182) = 150.73, p <0.0001)] revealed that there were statistically significant differences in the mean clinical practice performance among levels of emotional intelligence.\nThis study confirmed that the emotional intelligence of nursing students had significantly affected their clinical performance. This finding poses important questions for the educators responsible for nursing education in both academic and clinical settings. Further investigation is required to assess the factors that increase or decrease EI in nursing students is warranted.", "The COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic has had a significant impact on society, both because of the serious health effects of COVID-19 and because of public health measures implemented to slow its spread. Many of these difficulties are fundamentally information needs; attempts to address these needs have caused an information overload for both researchers and the public. Natural language processing (NLP)-the branch of artificial intelligence that interprets human language-can be applied to address many of the information needs made urgent by the COVID-19 pandemic. This review surveys approximately 150 NLP studies and more than 50 systems and datasets addressing the COVID-19 pandemic. We detail work on four core NLP tasks: information retrieval, named entity recognition, literature-based discovery, and question answering. We also describe work that directly addresses aspects of the pandemic through four additional tasks: topic modeling, sentiment and emotion analysis, caseload forecasting, and misinformation detection. We conclude by discussing observable trends and remaining challenges.", "Additive manufacturing, artificial intelligence and cloud manufacturing are three pillars of the emerging digitized industrial revolution, considered in industry 4.0. The literature shows that in industry 4.0, intelligent cloud based additive manufacturing plays a crucial role. Considering this, few studies have accomplished an integration of the intelligent additive manufacturing and the service oriented manufacturing paradigms. This is due to the lack of prerequisite frameworks to enable this integration. These frameworks should create an autonomous platform for cloud based service composition for additive manufacturing based on customer demands. One of the most important requirements of customer processing in autonomous manufacturing platforms is the interpretation of the product shape; as a result, accurate and automated shape interpretation plays an important role in this integration. Unfortunately despite this fact, accurate shape interpretation has not been a subject of research studies in the additive manufacturing, except limited studies aiming machine level production process. This paper has proposed a framework to interpret shapes, or their informative two dimensional pictures, automatically by decomposing them into simpler shapes which can be categorized easily based on provided training data. To do this, two algorithms which apply a Recurrent Neural Network and a two dimensional Convolutional Neural Network as decomposition and recognition tools respectively are proposed. These two algorithms are integrated and case studies are designed to demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed platform. The results suggest that considering the complex objects which can be decomposed with planes perpendicular to one axis of Cartesian coordination system and parallel withother two, the decomposition algorithm can even give results using an informative 2D image of the object.", "The application of new sensor technologies for frequent biomarker monitoring in combination with the leverage of artificial intelligence has great potential to improve the design and safety of health care. With current research efforts, the screening of tens of biomarkers at the point of care and immediate adjustment of therapy is coming within reach. Here we introduce an optical multiplexing approach based on multi-pinhole interference providing inherent differential referencing between a multitude of measurement fields on a surface. A theoretical study of an 11-plex and a 54-plex design is complemented with the experimental demonstration of the technique for a 3-field refractive index measurements and detection of human \u03b1-thrombin.", "Background: As a result of migration, an increasing number of patients in forensic psychiatric hospitals show poor skills in the national language, which can affect their treatment. Improving the second language (L2) of inpatients with schizophrenia may help to enable effective psychotherapy and thus reduce the risk of criminal recidivism and facilitate reintegration into society, for example because of a language-related higher degree of social functioning. For this purpose, a Hessian forensic psychiatric hospital established a ward specialized in L2 acquisition. The ward accommodates up to 21 patients with schizophrenia, who attend an L2 program consisting of 800-900 lessons within 1 year. Aims: The study aimed to evaluate whether patients on the specialized ward (experimental group) achieve at least Common European Framework of Reference (CEFR) level A2 in the L2 program. Additionally, it examined whether language acquisition is better among participants in the experimental group than among those on regular wards (control group). Methods: Achievements in the L2 were assessed by an L2 test 3 times: at the beginning of the program, after 6 months, and after 1 year. The impact of intelligence on achievements in L2 was evaluated using Raven's Standard Progressive Matrices. Results: The experimental group showed significantly better improvement than the control group. Literacy was a significant predictor of improvement in the L2. The majority of the experimental group reached at least CEFR level A2 after 1 year. Conclusions: High-intensity L2 programs are an effective way to improve the L2 of inpatients with schizophrenia in forensic psychiatric hospitals."], "authior": [[["Rakha Emad A"], ["Vougas
