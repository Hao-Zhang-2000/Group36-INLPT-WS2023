Identification of the genetic polymorphisms associated with early-stage neurodevelopment will help elucidate biological mechanisms involved in neuro-behavior and provide a better understanding of the developing brain. To search for such variants, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for infant mental and motor ability at two years of age with mothers and children recruited from cohorts in Bangladesh and Mexico. Infant ability was assessed using mental and motor composite scores calculated with country-specific versions of the Bayley Scales of Infant Development. A missense variant (rs1055153) located in the gene WWTR1 reached genome-wide significance in association with mental composite score (meta-analysis effect size of minor allele \u03b2meta\u2009=\u2009-6.04; 95% CI: -8.13 to -3.94; P\u2009=\u20091.56\u00d710-8). Infants carrying the minor allele reported substantially lower cognitive scores in both cohorts, and this variant is predicted to be in the top 0.3% of most deleterious substitutions in the human genome. Fine mapping and region-based association testing provided additional suggestive evidence that both WWTR1 and a second gene, LRP1B, were associated with infant cognitive ability.

Instead of the network analysis used in the target article (Rapuc et\u00a0al., 2023), I used confirmatory factor analysis and special forms of structural equation modelling designed to capture interactions between processes and their differentiation from general cognitive ability. I found, in line with the target article, that premature children scored lower overall in cognitive ability, and that cognitive processes are more strongly related in preterm than in full-term children. However, in contrast to the target article, specific abilities tended to differentiate with increasing general ability in preterm rather than in full-term children. In full-term children, increases in specific abilities were commensurate with increases in general ability. These differences may reflect slower development in preterm children and stronger dependence on executive processes dominating in preschool.

While AI-based homecare systems are being developed, the perspectives of chronic patients, who are one of the primary beneficiaries and risk bearers of these technologies, remain largely under-researched. While recent research has highlighted the importance of AI-based homecare systems, the current understanding of patients' desired designs and features is still limited.\nThis paper explores chronic patients' perspectives regarding AI-based homecare systems, an area currently underrepresented in research. We aim to identify the factors influencing their decision to use such systems, elucidate the potential roles of government and other concerned authorities, and provide feedback to AI developers to enhance adoption, system design, and usability and improve the overall healthcare experiences of chronic patients.\nA web-based open-ended questionnaire was designed to gather the perspectives of chronic patients about AI-based homecare systems. In total, responses from 181 participants were collected. Using Krippendorff's clustering technique, an inductive thematic analysis was performed to identify the main themes and their respective subthemes.\nThrough rigorous coding and thematic analysis of the collected responses, we identified four major themes further segmented into thirteen subthemes. These four primary themes were: 1) \"Personalized Design\", emphasizing the need for patients to manage their health condition better through personalized and educational resources and user-friendly interfaces; 2) \"Emotional & Social Support\", underscoring the desire for AI systems to facilitate social connectivity and provide emotional support to improve the well-being of chronic patients at home; 3) \"System Integration & Proactive Care\", addressing the importance of seamless communication, proactive patient monitoring and integration with existing healthcare platforms; and 4) \"Ethics & Regulation\", prioritizing ethical guidelines, regulatory compliance, and affordability in the design.\nThis study has offered significant insights into the needs and expectations of chronic patients regarding AI-based home care systems.

Public health policies are of particular importance, as they often dictate matters in life and death. Accumulating evidence indicates that good-intentioned COVID-19 policies, such as shelter-in-place measures, can often result in unintended consequences among vulnerable populations such as nursing home residents and domestic violence victims. Thus, to shed light on the issue, this study aimed to identify policy-making processes that have the potential of developing policies that could induce optimal desirable outcomes with limited to no unintended consequences amid the pandemic and beyond. Methods: A literature review was conducted in PubMed, PsycINFO, and Scopus to answer the research question. To better structure the review and the subsequent analysis, theoretical frameworks such as the social ecological model were adopted to guide the process. Results: The findings suggested that: (1) people-centered; (2) artificial intelligence (AI)-powered; (3) data-driven, and (4) supervision-enhanced policy-making processes could help society develop policies that have the potential to yield desirable outcomes with limited unintended consequences. To leverage these strategies' interconnectedness, the people-centered, AI-powered, data-driven, and supervision-enhanced (PADS) model of policy making was subsequently developed. Conclusions: The PADS model can develop policies that have the potential to induce optimal outcomes and limit or eliminate unintended consequences amid COVID-19 and beyond. Rather than serving as a definitive answer to problematic COVID-19 policy-making practices, the PADS model could be best understood as one of many promising frameworks that could bring the pandemic policy-making process more in line with the interests of societies at large; in other words, more cost-effectively, and consistently anti-COVID and pro-human.", "authors": [["Su Zhaohui"]], "title": "Rigorous Policy-Making Amid COVID-19 and Beyond: Literature Review and Critical Insights.", "article_id": [["34886171"], ["PMC8657108"], ["10.3390/ijerph182312447"], ["ijerph182312447"]]}, {"abstract": "Direct-to-consumer (DTC) health care artificial intelligence (AI) apps hold the potential to bridge the spatial and temporal disparities in health care resources, but they also come with individual and societal risks due to AI errors.

They underwent clinical and cognitive testing and hormonal assessments of menopause status. Multivariate general linear models for multiple memory outcomes were used to test hypotheses controlling for potential confounders. Episodic memory, executive function, semantic processing, and estimated verbal intelligence were assessed. Associative memory and episodic verbal memory were assessed using Face-Name Associative Memory Exam (FNAME) and Selective Reminding Test (SRT), given increased sensitivity to detecting early cognitive decline. Impacts of sex and reproductive stage on performance were tested.\nWomen outperformed men on all memory measures including FNAME (\u03b2\u200a=\u200a-0.30, P < 0.0001) and SRT (\u03b2\u200a=\u200a-0.29, P\u200a<\u200a0.0001).

Here, we performed a meta-genome-wide association study of vocabulary acquisition and investigated polygenic overlap with literacy, cognition, developmental phenotypes and neurodevelopmental conditions, including Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).\nWe studied 37,913 parent-reported vocabulary size measures (English, Dutch, Danish) for 17,298 European descent children. Meta-analyses were performed for early-phase expressive (infancy, 15-18 months), late-phase expressive (toddlerhood, 24-38 months) and late-phase receptive (toddlerhood, 24-38 months) vocabulary. Subsequently, we estimated Single-Nucleotide Polymorphism heritability (SNP-h2) and genetic correlations (rg), and modelled underlying factor structures with multivariate models.\nEarly-life vocabulary size was modestly heritable (SNP-h2: 0.08(SE=0.01) to 0.24(SE=0.03)). Genetic overlap between infant expressive and toddler receptive vocabulary was negligible (rg=0.07(SE=0.10)), although each measure was moderately related to toddler expressive vocabulary (rg=0.69(SE=0.14) and rg=0.67(SE=0.16), respectively), suggesting a multi-factorial genetic architecture. Both infant and toddler expressive vocabulary were genetically linked to literacy (e.g. spelling: rg=0.58(SE=0.20) and rg=0.79(SE=0.25), respectively), underlining genetic similarity.

Fifty-three adults with ASD (age range: 25-65\u2009years) were compared to 52 age-, biological sex-, and intelligence-matched typically developing (TD; age range: 21-67\u2009years) adults on three STM span tasks, which tested STM performance for letters (Verbal), grid locations (Visuospatial), or letters in grid locations (Multimodal). A subsample of 34 TD and 33 ASD participants ranging in age from 25 to 64\u2009years completed a fourth Multimodal Integration task. We also administered the Color Trails Test as a measure of executive function. ASD participants' accuracy was lower than that of the TD participants on the three span tasks (Cohen's d: 0.26-0.50). The Integration task difference was marginally significant (p = .07) but had a moderate effect size (Cohen's d = 0.50). Regression analyses confirmed reduced STM performance only for older TD participants. Analyses also indicated that executive processes played a greater role in the ASD group's performance. The demonstration of similar difficulties and age-related patterning of STM in ASD to those documented for LTM and the greater recruitment of executive processes by older ASD participants on the Integration task suggest a compensatory role of frontal processes both as a means of achieving undiminished task performance and as a possible protection against older age cognitive decline in ASD.

This study tested different kinds of STM and showed that ASD adults remembered shorter sequences of letters, crosses, or letters in grid cells less well than matched participants with typical development. However, older ASD individuals performed similarly to younger ASD individuals, nor showing the reduction in performance usually seen with older age. The data suggest that ASD individuals use different underlying mechanisms when performing the tasks and that this might help protect their memory as they grow older.", "authors": [["Ring Melanie"], ["Guillery-Girard B\u00e9reng\u00e8re"], ["Quinette Peggy"], ["Gaigg Sebastian B"], ["Bowler Dermot M"]], "title": "Short-Term Memory Span and Cross-Modality Integration in Younger and Older Adults With and Without Autism Spectrum Disorder.", "article_id": [["32926571"], ["10.1002/aur.2387"]]}, {"abstract": "Neurotrimin (Ntm) belongs to the IgLON family of cell adhesion molecules with Lsamp, Obcam and kilon that regulate the outgrowth of neurites mostly by forming heterodimers.

The emphasis is put on how monkey research improved our understanding of the medial temporal lobe (MTL) role and how tasks designed for monkeys influenced research in humans. The story starts in the early 1950s. Back then, memory was not a fashionable scientific topic. It was viewed as a function of the whole brain and not of specialized brain areas. All that changed in 1957-1958 when Brenda Milner, a neuropsychologist from Montreal, described patient H.M. He forgot all events as he lived them despite a fully preserved intelligence. He had received a MTL resection to relieve epilepsy. H.M. (1926-2008) would become the most influential patient in brain science. Which structures among those included in H.M.'s large lesion were important for recognition memory could not be evaluated in humans. It was gradually understood only after the successful development of a monkey model of human amnesia by Mishkin in 1978. Selective lesions and two behavioral tasks, delayed nonmatching-to-sample and visual paired comparison, were used to distinguish the contribution of the hippocampus from that of adjacent cortical areas. Driven by findings in non-human primates, human research on recognition memory is now trying to solve the question of whether the different structures composing MTL contributes to familiarity and recollection, the two possible forms taken by recognition. We described in particular two French patients, FRG and JMG, whose deficits support the currently dominant model attributing to the perirhinal cortex a critical role in recognition memory. Research on recognition memory has implications for the clinician as it may help understanding the cognitive deficits observed in different diseases. An illustration of such approach, linking basic and applied research, is provided for Alzheimer's disease.", "authors": [["Meunier M"], ["Barbeau E"]], "title": "Recognition memory and the medial temporal lobe: from monkey research to human pathology.", "article_id": [["23473622"], ["10.1016/j.neurol.2013.01.623"], ["S0035-3787(13)00662-0"]]}, {"abstract": "The extent to which navigational spatial memory depends on hippocampal integrity in humans is not well documented. We investigated allocentric spatial recall using a virtual environment in a group of patients with severe hippocampal damage (SHD), a group of patients with \"moderate\" hippocampal damage (MHD), and a normal control group. Through four learning blocks with feedback, participants learned the target locations of four different objects in a circular arena. Distal cues were present throughout the experiment to provide orientation. A circular boundary as well as an intra-arena landmark provided spatial reference frames. During a subsequent test phase, recall of all four objects was tested with only the boundary or the landmark being present. Patients with SHD were impaired in both phases of this task. Across groups, performance on both types of spatial recall was highly correlated with memory quotient (MQ), but not with intelligence quotient (IQ), age, or sex. However, both measures of spatial recall separated experimental groups beyond what would be expected based on MQ, a widely used measure of general memory function. Boundary-based and landmark-based spatial recall were both strongly related to bilateral hippocampal volumes, but not to volumes of the thalamus, putamen, pallidum, nucleus accumbens, or caudate nucleus. The results show that boundary-based and landmark-based allocentric spatial recall are similarly impaired in patients with SHD, that both types of recall are impaired beyond that predicted by MQ, and that recall deficits are best explained by a reduction in bilateral hippocampal volumes.\nIn humans, bilateral hippocampal atrophy can lead to profound impairments in episodic memory. Across species, perhaps the most well-established contribution of the hippocampus to memory is not to episodic memory generally but to allocentric spatial memory. However, the extent to which navigational spatial memory depends on hippocampal integrity in humans is not well documented. We investigated spatial recall using a virtual environment in two groups of patients with hippocampal damage (moderate/severe) and a normal control group.

During progression, agrammatism in writing with impairments in syntactic comprehension emerged in parallel with an unusual graphomotor deficit in drawing and writing, with an increasing deterioration of graphic short-term memory. We investigated C.S.'s graphomotor deficit longitudinally using tests of writing and drawing on letters, words, and sentences and drawing to command and copying. We also tested C.S.'s short-term graphemic buffer experimentally. Analysis showed deficits on selective aspects of graphomotor implementation of writing and drawing, mainly affecting the production of circles and curves, but not short straight lines in drawing and writing, and graphomotor short-term memory, which paralleled impairments of written syntax and syntactic comprehension. We believe this to be the first detailed analysis of such an unusual progressive impairment in graphomotor production, which may be related to problems with agrammatic agraphia and impairments affecting shared components of cognition reflecting damage to shared neural networks. Alternatively, they may simply reflect the effects of coincidental damage to separate mechanisms responsible for aspects of writing, drawing, and syntactic processing.

This study investigated whether activity in the fluid \"reasoning\" network, which includes frontal, parietal, temporal and occipital regions, is differently modulated by task complexity in autistic and non-autistic individuals during the RSPM. In this purpose, we used fMRI to study autistic and non-autistic participants solving the 60 RSPM problems focussing on regions and networks involved in reasoning complexity. As complexity increased, activity in the left superior occipital gyrus and the left middle occipital gyrus increased for autistic participants, whereas non-autistic participants showed increased activity in the left middle frontal gyrus and bilateral precuneus. Using psychophysiological interaction analyses (PPI), we then verified in which regions did functional connectivity increase as a function of reasoning complexity. PPI analyses revealed greater connectivity in autistic, compared to non-autistic participants, between the left inferior occipital gyrus and areas in the left superior frontal gyrus, right superior parietal lobe, right middle occipital gyrus and right inferior temporal gyrus. We also observed generally less modulation of the reasoning network as complexity increased in autistic participants. These results suggest that autistic individuals, when confronted with increasing task complexity, rely mainly on visuospatial processes when solving more complex matrices.

We analyzed behavioral and neuroanatomical data from 402 humans (212 males; 190 females) with chronic, focal brain lesions. Structural equation models (SEMs) demonstrated a psychometric isomorphism between g and working memory in our sample (which we refer to as g/Gwm), but not between g and other cognitive abilities. Multivariate lesion-behavior mapping analyses indicated that g and working memory localize most critically to a site of converging white matter tracts deep to the left temporo-parietal junction. Tractography analyses demonstrated that the regions in the lesion-behavior map of g/Gwm were primarily associated with the arcuate fasciculus. The anatomic findings were validated in an independent cohort of acute stroke patients (n = 101) using model-based predictions of cognitive deficits generated from the Iowa cohort lesion-behavior maps. The neuroanatomical localization of g/Gwm provided the strongest prediction of observed g in the new cohort (r = 0.42, p < 0.001), supporting the anatomic specificity of our findings.

More recently, mutations in the SIL1 gene, which encodes an endoplasmic reticulum resident co-chaperone, were identified as the main cause of Marinesco-Sj\u00f6gren syndrome. Here we describe the results of SIL1 mutation analysis in 62 patients presenting with early-onset ataxia, cataracts and myopathy or combinations of at least two of these. We obtained a mutation detection rate of 60% (15/25) among patients with the characteristic Marinesco-Sj\u00f6gren syndrome triad (ataxia, cataracts, myopathy) whereas the detection rate in the group of patients with more variable phenotypic presentation was below 3% (1/37). We report 16 unrelated families with a total of 19 different SIL1 mutations. Among these mutations are 15 previously unreported changes, including single- and multi-exon deletions. Based on data from our screening cohort and data compiled from the literature we found that SIL1 mutations are invariably associated with the combination of a cerebellar syndrome and chronic myopathy. Cataracts were observed in all patients beyond the age of 7 years, but might be missing in infants. Six patients with SIL1 mutations had no intellectual disability, extending the known wide range of cognitive capabilities in Marinesco-Sj\u00f6gren syndrome to include normal intelligence. Modestly constant features were somatic growth retardation, skeletal abnormalities and pyramidal tract signs. Examination of mutant SIL1 expression in cultured patient lymphoblasts suggested that SIL1 mutations result in severely reduced SIL1 protein levels irrespective of the type and position of mutations. Our data broaden the SIL1 mutation spectrum and confirm that SIL1 is the major Marinesco-Sj\u00f6gren syndrome gene. SIL1 patients usually present with the characteristic triad but cataracts might be missing in young children. As cognitive impairment is not obligatory, patients without intellectual disability but a Marinesco-Sj\u00f6gren syndrome-compatible phenotype should receive SIL1 mutation analysis. Despite allelic heterogeneity and many families with private mutations, the phenotype related to SIL1 mutations is relatively homogenous.

Here, we employ a novel whole-report memory task that allowed us to distinguish between varying levels of attentional engagement in humans performing a working memory task. By characterizing low-performance trials, we can distinguish between models in which working memory performance failures are caused by either (1) complete lapses of attention or (2) variations in attentional control. We found that performance failures increase with set-size and strongly predict working memory capacity. Performance variability was best modeled by an attentional control model of attention, not a lapse model. We examined neural signatures of performance failures by measuring EEG activity while participants performed the whole-report task. The number of items correctly recalled in the memory task was predicted by frontal theta power, with decreased frontal theta power associated with poor performance on the task. In addition, we found that poor performance was not explained by failures of sensory encoding; the P1/N1 response and ocular artifact rates were equivalent for high- and low-performance trials.

Here we show that factors influencing mild ID (lowest 3% of IQ distribution) were similar to those influencing IQ in the normal range. In contrast, the factors influencing severe ID (lowest 0.5% of IQ distribution) differ from those influencing mild ID or IQ scores in the normal range.

This paper argues that neither view sufficiently acknowledges that consciousness may refer to the brain's most adaptive property: its capacity to produce states of objectivity. It is proposed that this capacity relies on multiple sensorimotor networks for internally representing objects and their properties in terms of expectancies, as well as on motivational and motor mechanisms involved in exploration, play, and care for vulnerable living and non-living objects. States of objectivity are associated with a very special phenomenal aspect; the experience that subjective aspects are absent and one is \"just looking\" at the world as it really is and can be. However, these states are normally closely preceded and followed by (and tend to be combined or fused with) sensations and feelings which are caused by activation of sensory and motivational mechanisms. A capacity for objectivity may have evolved in different species and can be conceived as a common basis for other elusive psychological properties such as intelligence, conscience, and esthetic experience; all three linked to crucial behaviors in human evolution such as tool making, cooperation, and art.

The current study is the first to investigate the consequences of hypothalamic involvement on neural substrates of emotional and cognitive functioning. Ten patients with childhood craniopharyngioma and known hypothalamic involvement and fifteen age- and intelligence matched control subjects (median age: 17.8 and 17.3 yrs.) were studied with functional magnetic resonance imaging and an emotional face recognition task. During encoding, participants were asked to classify neutral and emotional faces. In a subsequent recognition phase, participants had to recognize these old faces within a set of new faces. Behavioral performance was comparable between patients and controls. Neural activity revealed, however, differential recruitment of fronto-limbic brain regions during recognition. Patients exhibited an abnormal pattern of task-induced activation and deactivation in the anterior and posterior rostral medial prefrontal cortex and a higher functional coupling between anterior rostral medial prefrontal cortex and the thalamus.

Results show that among the children initially categorized as autistic, 82.6% remained over the ADOS diagnostic threshold, 11.9% converted to atypical autism, and 5.4% fell under the ADOS threshold. Most atypical autism diagnoses were unstable. Most (81.7%) autistic participants had an ID at inclusion. At T1, 59.3% were nonverbal, but only 39% at T4.

Detecting ASD at an early stage is crucial for timely interventions and an improved quality of life. In recent times, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been increasingly used in ASD research. The rise in ASD diagnoses is due to the growing number of ASD cases and the recognition of the importance of early detection, which leads to better symptom management.

Despite what was known about the benignity of this syndrome, there is always more evidence about the involvement of the cognitive functions with different deficits in several domains to be investigated.\nThe aim of our study was to describe prognostic electroencephalogram (EEG) pattern of an adverse cognitive development to recognize patients at higher risk of lasting cognitive deficits that could need antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) or an improved neurocognitive therapy. In addition, we wanted to investigate the existence of a possible linkage between the number of interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) in the EEG and the more pronounced cognitive deficits.\nWe performed a case-control study on a cohort of 16 patients (10 male and 6 female) aged 4-14, diagnosed with BECTS who underwent EEG, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and neurocognitive assessment at the Pediatric Neurology Unit at the Umberto I Hospital, Sapienza University of Rome. Patients were divided into two groups according to the percentage of IEDs evaluated based on their sleep EEG: group A with less than 50% of the entire EEG invaded by discharges in more than 70% of the total number of EEG performed, so-called with low or intermediate activation. On the contrary, group B had a high activation, with more than 50% of the entire EEG invaded by discharges in the same percentage of the EEG performed. All children were assessed based on a protocol designed to study neuropsychological functions with specific tests chosen depending on age (Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children IV: WISC IV; Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence III: WPPSI III). Groups were compared for cognitive outcomes achieved by each patient through Student's t-test with a significance level of p<0.05 (two-tailed).\nThere is no statistically significant difference in the cognitive outcomes of these patients: Student's t-test showed a statistical significance (p) for each cognitive index always higher than 0.05, demonstrating that the intellectual quotient (IQ) and all other indexes analyzed (verbal comprehension index (VCI), perceptual reasoning index (PRI), working memory index (WMI), and processing speed index (PSI)) are not affected by the difference in EEG anomalies presented by our patients. Interestingly, all patients had an IQ equal to or greater than the Italian average (12 out of 16 patients showed an IQ>100), with selective drops, particularly significant in the WMI and also in the PSI.\nOur results clearly demonstrate the importance of a proper evaluation of patients with this kind of epilepsy, without paying attention only to those with the greatest number of IEDs or seizures because all of them had a neurocognitive impairment, especially in memory. These data may be reinforced by a larger sample for an even more significant statistical value.

This study aims to investigate how the co-occurrence of epilepsy and Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) affects autistic characteristics assessed by the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS), which has been used as a measure of autism symptoms in previous studies. In this research we referred to all individuals with Autism or Autistic Disorder as individuals with ASD.\nWe reviewed the complete medical records of 182 participants who presented to a single tertiary care referral center from January 1, 2013 to July 28, 2015, and subsequently received complete child and adolescent psychiatric assessments. Of the 182 participants, 22 were diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder and epilepsy. Types of epilepsy observed in these individuals included complex partial seizure, generalized tonic-clonic seizure, or infantile spasm. Using 'Propensity Score Matching' we selected 44 children, diagnosed with only Autism Spectrum Disorder, whose age, gender, and intelligence quotient (IQ) were closely matched with the 22 children diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder and epilepsy. Social functioning of participants was assessed by the social responsiveness scale, which consists of five categories: social awareness, social cognition, social communication, social motivation, and autistic mannerisms. Bivariate analyses were conducted to compare the ASD participants with epilepsy group with the ASD-only group on demographic and clinical characteristics.

The present study addresses some limitations of Carroll's work: specification, reproducibility with more modern methods, and interpretive relevance. We reanalyzed select data sets from Carroll's survey of factor analytic studies using confirmatory factor analysis as well as modern indices of interpretive relevance. For the majority of data sets, we found that Carroll likely extracted too many factors representing Stratum II abilities. Moreover, almost all factors representing Stratum II abilities had little-to-no interpretive relevance above and beyond that of general intelligence. We conclude by discussing the implications of this research with respect to the interpretive relevance and clinical utility of scores reflecting cognitive abilities at all strata of the three-stratum theory and offer some directions for future research.

All participants (7 males, 4 females) were administered individual intelligence tests (Wechsler or Leiter scales or both), a measure of their academic skill levels (Woodcock-Johnson Tests of Achievement), and a screening measure of visual-motor integration ability (Beery-Buktenica). Consistent with our earlier findings, median IQ scores for the entire group on the Wechsler (median=84) and Leiter (median=92) scales continue to fall at the lower end of the average range compared to same-aged peers. The median scores for the group on a measure of visual-motor integration (median=76), visual perception (median=74) and motor coordination (median=60) were below average. Two distinct subgroups emerged based on participants' average or below average performance on the majority of academic subtests. Those participants with below average academic skills (n=6) demonstrated average nonverbal cognitive abilities on the Leiter, but had weaknesses in speech and language skills and greater medical involvement. Their profiles were more consistent with a learning disability diagnosis than an intellectual disability. Two of these participants showed a significant decline (15 and 23 points, respectively) on repeated Wechsler scales, but one continued to earn average scores on the Leiter scales where the verbal and motor demands are minimal. Participants with average academic skills (n=5) demonstrated average cognitive abilities (verbal and nonverbal) on the Wechsler scales and less medical involvement. Their speech and language skills appeared to be more intact. However, both groups earned below average median scores on the Beery-Buktenica motor coordination task. This study highlights the importance of using appropriate tests to capture both verbal and nonverbal abilities, considering each individual's motor skills, speech and language abilities, hearing status and native language. This will allow for a more accurate assessment of whether there is a learning disability or an intellectual disability. Long-term outcomes may be related to the stability of an individual's expressive and/or receptive language abilities over time. Changes in the speech and language domain may account for the decline in IQ observed in some IOPD long-term survivors, reflecting a learning disability rather than a decline in overall cognition or an intellectual disability.

Analysis of covariance adjusted for IQ, age, and sex was used.\nQEEG analysis revealed three ADHD subtypes, characterized by (A) elevated relative fast alpha and beta power, (B) elevated absolute slow frequency (delta and theta power), or (C) elevated absolute and relative beta power. A significant difference was found in the Korean ADHD Rating Scale (K-ARS) among the four groups (df=3, F=8.004, p<0.001); group C had the highest score (25.31\u00b111.16), followed by group A (21.67\u00b113.18). The score of group B (12.64\u00b17.84) was similar to that of the NT group (11.07\u00b16.12) and did not reach the cut-off point of the K-ARS. In the Wender-Utah Rating Scale (WURS), group B score (55.82\u00b123.17) was significantly higher than the NT group score (42.81\u00b113.26).\nThese results indicate that children with ADHD do not constitute a neurophysiologically homogenous group. Children with QEEG subtype B (elevated slow frequency) may be difficult to distinguish from normal children using the K-ARS, which is the most common screening tool for ADHD.

Such inbreeding depression is thought to occur due to increased homozygosity at causal variants that are recessive with respect to fitness. Until recently it has been difficult to amass large enough sample sizes to investigate the effects of inbreeding depression on complex traits using genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data in population-based samples. Further, it is difficult to infer causation in analyses that relate degree of inbreeding to complex traits because confounding variables (e.g., education) may influence both the likelihood for parents to outbreed and offspring trait values. The present study used runs of homozygosity in genome-wide SNP data in up to 400,000 individuals in the UK Biobank to estimate the proportion of the autosome that exists in autozygous tracts-stretches of the genome which are identical due to a shared common ancestor. After multiple testing corrections and controlling for possible sociodemographic confounders, we found significant relationships in the predicted direction between estimated autozygosity and three of the 26 traits we investigated: age at first sexual intercourse, fluid intelligence, and forced expiratory volume in 1 second. Our findings corroborate those of several published studies. These results may imply that these traits have been associated with Darwinian fitness over evolutionary time. However, some of the autozygosity-trait relationships were attenuated after controlling for background sociodemographic characteristics, suggesting that alternative explanations for these associations have not been eliminated.

Although previous studies have shown that EF and intelligence are related, it is unknown whether these constructs relate to one another in a similar manner across different ability groups (mild intellectual disability, borderline intellectual disability and normal/high intelligence). This study therefore examines the relation between three EFs (inhibition, shifting and updating) and intelligence in a heterogeneous psychiatric sample. It is hypothesised that the strength of the relation between intelligence and the three EFs decreases when the level of intelligence increases, in accordance with Spearman's Law of Diminishing Returns.\nIn a cross-sectional, between and within subject design, one of the three intelligence tests (Kaufman Adolescent and Adult Intelligence Test and Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale - third and fourth editions) and several EF tests (Stroop Colour-Word Test, Trail Making Test and Spatial Working Memory task) were administered to 250 neuropsychiatric inpatients and outpatients (Mage \u00a0=\u00a039.8, standard deviation\u00a0=\u00a014.3, 52.8% male). Based upon their full-scale IQ score, patients were divided into three ability groups (mild intellectual disability, borderline intellectual disability or normal/high intelligence). The relation between EF and intelligence was assessed through analyses of the correlation pattern; groups were compared using analysis of covariance.\nAnalyses showed significant correlations between the constructs of EF and intelligence. A significant interaction effect was found for shifting, with highest correlations in the normal to high intelligence group, but not for inhibition and updating.\nResults support a specific role for shifting in this EF-intelligence relation. The correlational pattern of updating and intelligence, as well as the differential relation of shifting and intelligence across ability groups, suggests that EF tasks may not measure distinct EFs in lower intellectual ability but rely on cognitive primitives such as processing speed. EF tasks can be considered less valid indicators of EF ability.

However, children who use hearing aids (HAs) may have inconsistent access to their auditory environment due to limitations in speech audibility through their HAs or limited HA use. The effects of variability in children's auditory experience on parent-reported auditory skills questionnaires and on speech recognition in quiet and in noise were examined for a large group of children who were followed as part of the Outcomes of Children with Hearing Loss study.\nParent ratings on auditory development questionnaires and children's speech recognition were assessed for 306 children who are hard of hearing. Children ranged in age from 12 months to 9 years. Three questionnaires involving parent ratings of auditory skill development and behavior were used, including the LittlEARS Auditory Questionnaire, Parents Evaluation of Oral/Aural Performance in Children rating scale, and an adaptation of the Speech, Spatial, and Qualities of Hearing scale. Speech recognition in quiet was assessed using the Open- and Closed-Set Test, Early Speech Perception test, Lexical Neighborhood Test, and Phonetically Balanced Kindergarten word lists. Speech recognition in noise was assessed using the Computer-Assisted Speech Perception Assessment. Children who are hard of hearing were compared with peers with normal hearing matched for age, maternal educational level, and nonverbal intelligence. The effects of aided audibility, HA use, and language ability on parent responses to auditory development questionnaires and on children's speech recognition were also examined.\nChildren who are hard of hearing had poorer performance than peers with normal hearing on parent ratings of auditory skills and had poorer speech recognition. Significant individual variability among children who are hard of hearing was observed. Children with greater aided audibility through their HAs, more hours of HA use, and better language abilities generally had higher parent ratings of auditory skills and better speech-recognition abilities in quiet and in noise than peers with less audibility, more limited HA use, or poorer language abilities. In addition to the auditory and language factors that were predictive for speech recognition in quiet, phonological working memory was also a positive predictor for word recognition abilities in noise.\nChildren who are hard of hearing continue to experience delays in auditory skill development and speech-recognition abilities compared with peers with normal hearing. However, significant improvements in these domains have occurred in comparison to similar data reported before the adoption of universal newborn hearing screening and early intervention programs for children who are hard of hearing. Increasing the audibility of speech has a direct positive effect on auditory skill development and speech-recognition abilities and also may enhance these skills by improving language abilities in children who are hard of hearing.

We aim to address the general expectation that early cochlear implantation enables children who are hard of hearing to develop comprehensively, including with respect to verbal intelligence. The primary purpose of this study is to trace the longitudinal development of verbal and nonverbal intelligence in children with cochlear implants (CIs).\nSixteen children with congenital hearing loss who received unilateral or bilateral implants and completed at least two intelligence assessments around the age of school entrance were included in the study. The first assessment was performed around 3 years after CI fitting (chronological age range: 3.93 to 7.03 years). The second assessment was performed approximately 2 years after the first assessment.

At the time of the second measurement, verbal and nonverbal IQ were on a comparable level. Nevertheless, we also observed strong inter-individual differences. The duration between both assessments was significantly associated with verbal IQ at the second measurement time point and thus with verbal IQ gain over time. Education mode (regular vs. special kindergarten/school) was significantly correlated with nonverbal IQ at the second assessment time point.\nThe results, despite the small sample size, clearly suggest that children with CIs can achieve intellectual abilities comparable to those of their normal-hearing peers by around the third year after initial CI fitting, and they continue to improve over the following 2 years.

The APD children were randomly assigned to (1) a control group that received only the current standard treatment for children diagnosed with APD, employing various listening/educational strategies at school (N = 19); or (2) an intervention group that undertook a 3-month 5-day/week computer-based auditory training program at home, consisting of a wide variety of speech-based listening tasks with competing sounds, in addition to the current standard treatment.

Outcome measures were repeated 3 months postintervention in the intervention group only, to assess the sustainability of treatment effects. The outcome measures were (1) the mean speech reception threshold obtained from the four subtests of the listening in specialized noise test that assesses sentence perception in various configurations of masking speech, and in which the target speakers and test materials were unrelated to the training materials; (2) the Children's Auditory Performance Scale that assesses listening skills, completed by the children's teachers; and (3) the Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamental-4 pragmatic profile that assesses pragmatic language use, completed by parents.\nAll outcome measures significantly improved at immediate postintervention in the intervention group only, with effect sizes ranging from 0.76 to 1.7.

However, their current use in clinical practice is marginal and limited to an assistive role to help clinicians in their practices. Safety and efficiency concerns, as well as a general lack of knowledge and experience, may explain this discrepancy between the expected (sometimes futuristic) and current use of virtual characters. An overview of recent evidence would help pinpoint the main concerns and challenges pertaining to their use in mental healthcare. Objective This paper aims to inform relevant actors, including clinicians, on the potential of virtual characters in mental healthcare practices and to raise awareness on societal challenges regarding their use. Method A narrative literature review was conducted to summarize basic and clinical research findings, and to outline an in-depth discussion on various societal caveats related to the inclusion of virtual characters. Results Basic studies highlight several characteristics of the virtual characters that seem to influence patient-clinician interactions. These characteristics can be classified into two categories: perceptual (e.g. realism) and social features (i.e. attribution of social categories such as gender). To this day, many interventions and/or assessments using virtual characters have shown various levels of efficiency in mental health, and certain elements of a therapeutic relationship (e.g. alliance and empathy) may even be triggered during an interaction with a virtual character. To develop and increase the use of virtual characters, numerous socioeconomic and ethical issues must be examined. Although the accessibility and the availability of virtual characters are an undeniable advantage for their use in mental healthcare, some inequities about their application remain. In addition, the accumulation of biometric data (e.g. heart rate) could provide valuable information to clinicians and could help develop autonomous virtual characters, which raises concerns over issues of security and privacy. This paper proposes some recommendations to avoid such undesirable outcomes. Conclusion Due to their promising features, the inclusion of virtual characters will no doubt be increasingly prevalent in mental healthcare services. All involved actors should thus be informed about specific challenges raised by such breakthroughs.

Relationships between scores on CAPD, language (CELF), and cognition (WISC) tests were examined using correlation analysis.\nDD and FP showed significant correlations with Full Scale Intelligence Quotient, and the DD left ear and the DD interaural difference measures both showed significant correlations with working memory.

Unlike DD and FP, the CS test was not correlated with cognition. Additionally, language measures were not significantly correlated with any of the CAPD tests.

The present review outlines the key tenets and evidence for PP, and assesses its implications for intelligence research. It is argued that PP suggests indeterminacy as a unifying principle from which to investigate the cognitive hierarchy and brain-ability correlations. The resulting framework not only accommodates prominent psychometric models of intelligence, but also incorporates key findings from neuroanatomical and functional activation research, and motivates new predictions via the mechanisms of prediction-error minimization.

All patients were partially adherent or nonadherent Medicare Part D members of Kaiser Permanente, Southern California, a large integrated health plan. Patients received SMS reminders in English or Spanish and used simple numeric or text responses to validate their identity, view their medication, and complete a refill request. The refill requests were processed by Kaiser Permanente pharmacists and support staff, and refills were picked up at the pharmacy or mailed to patients. Descriptive statistics and predictive analytics were used to examine the patient population and their refill behavior. Qualitative text analysis was used to evaluate quality of conversational AI.\nOver the course of the study, 273,356 refill reminders requests were sent to 99,217 patients, resulting in 47,552 refill requests (17.40%). This was consistent with earlier pilot study findings. Of those who requested a refill, 54.81% (26,062/47,552) did so within 2 hours of the reminder. There was a strong inverse relationship (r10=-0.93) between social determinants of health and refill requests. Spanish speakers (5149/48,156, 10.69%) had significantly lower refill request rates compared with English speakers (42,389/225,060, 18.83%; X21 [n=273,216]=1829.2; P<.001).

Finally, the vast majority (284,598/307,484, 92.23%) of patient responses were handled using conversational AI.\nMultiple factors impacted refill request rates, including a strong association between social determinants of health and refill rates. The findings suggest that higher refill requests are linked to language, race/ethnicity, age, and social determinants of health, and that English speakers, whites, those younger than 75 years, and those with lower social determinants of health barriers are significantly more likely to request a refill via SMS.

Importantly, the intervention also had a significant effect on child gesture use with parents. There was no main effect of the intervention on child vocabulary. Further, the effect of the intervention on pointing was stronger for parents who endorsed fixed mindsets at baseline, and had an added benefit of increased vocabulary growth from 10-18\u00a0months for children of those parents who endorsed fixed mindsets.

Genetic influences on EFs are very high, even in middle childhood, but the extent to which these genetic influences overlap with those on intelligence is unclear.

Residual variation in general intelligence was influenced only by shared and nonshared environmental factors, and there remained no genetic variance in general intelligence that was unique of EF.

To the best of the authors' knowledge, there exists no systematic review addressing the methods that can be implemented in capturing gender identity- and sexual orientation-related data in the healthcare sector. A systematic literature review was conducted for filling in this gap of knowledge. Twenty-three articles were retained and analysed: two focussed on self-reported data, two on structured/semi-structured data, seven on text-mining, natural language processing, and other emerging artificial intelligence-based techniques, two on challenges in capturing sexual and gender-diverse populations, eight on the willingness to disclose gender identity and sexual orientation, and, finally, two on integrating structured and unstructured data. Our systematic literature review found that, despite the importance of collecting gender identity- and sexual orientation-related data and its increasing societal acceptance from the LGBTI community, several issues have to be addressed yet. Transgender, non-binary identities, and also intersex individuals remain often invisible and marginalized. In the last decades, there has been an increasing adoption of structured data. However, exploiting unstructured data seems to overperform in identifying LGBTI members, especially integrating structured and unstructured data. Self-declared/self-perceived/self-disclosed definitions, while being respectful of one's perception, may not completely be aligned with sexual behaviours and activities.

Eligible patients were diagnosed with non-B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, aged at least 8 years, and survivors with at least 5 years since their initial diagnosis. Brain MRIs obtained during active therapy were systematically coded for leukoencephalopathy using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Event version 4. At least 5 years after their diagnosis, survivors completed neurocognitive testing, another brain MRI, and their parents completed neurobehavioural ratings of their child (Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function [BRIEF]). Follow-up MRI included diffusion tensor imaging to assess white matter integrity, with indices of fractional anisotropy, axial diffusivity, and radial diffusivity from frontal lobes, parietal lobes, and in the frontostriatal tract. The neuroradiologist, who assessed abnormal MRIs, was masked to both group assignment of survivors and the neurobehavioural and neurocognitive outcomes. The primary outcomes were neurobehavioural function, assessed from completed BRIEF, and neurocognitive performance, measured by direct neurocognitive tests (Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System, Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-IV/Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-III, Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Test, and Lafayette Grooved Pegboard Test).

Compared with population norms, survivors were reported to have more neurobehavioural problems with working memory, organisation, initiation, and planning (p<0\u00b7001 for all). Survivors had worse scores than the general population on direct measures of memory span, processing speed, and executive function (p<0\u00b705 for all). Survivors with a history of acute leukoencephalopathy had more neurobehavioural problems than survivors with no history of leukoencephalopathy on organisation (adjusted T-score 56\u00b72 [95% CI 53\u00b73-59\u00b71] vs 52\u00b72 [50\u00b74-53\u00b79], p=0\u00b7020) and initiation (55\u00b75 [52\u00b77-58\u00b73] vs 52\u00b71 [50\u00b74-53\u00b78], p=0\u00b7045). Survivors with acute leukoencephalopathy also had reduced white matter integrity in the frontostriatal tract at follow-up: lower fractional anisotropy (p=0\u00b7069), higher axial diffusivity (p=0\u00b7020), and higher radial diffusivity (p=0\u00b70077).

Here, our main aim was to quantitatively explore the cognitive-enhancing potential of microdosing psychedelics in healthy adults.\nDuring a microdosing event organized by the Dutch Psychedelic Society, we examined the effects of psychedelic truffles (which were later analyzed to quantify active psychedelic alkaloids) on two creativity-related problem-solving tasks: the Picture Concept Task assessing convergent thinking and the Alternative Uses Task assessing divergent thinking. A short version of the Ravens Progressive Matrices task assessed potential changes in fluid intelligence. We tested once before taking a microdose and once while the effects were expected to be manifested.\nWe found that both convergent and divergent thinking performance was improved after a non-blinded microdose, whereas fluid intelligence was unaffected.\nWhile this study provides quantitative support for the cognitive-enhancing properties of microdosing psychedelics, future research has to confirm these preliminary findings in more rigorous placebo-controlled study designs. Based on these preliminary results, we speculate that psychedelics might affect cognitive metacontrol policies by optimizing the balance between cognitive persistence and flexibility.

Interpretation of the French Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Fifth Edition (French WISC-V; Wechsler, 2016a) is based on a 5-factor model including Verbal Comprehension (VC), Visual Spatial (VS), Fluid Reasoning (FR), Working Memory (WM), and Processing Speed (PS). Evidence for the French WISC-V factorial structure was established exclusively through confirmatory factor analyses (CFAs). However, as recommended by Carroll (1995); Reise (2012), and Brown (2015), factorial structure should derive from both exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and CFA. The first goal of this study was to examine the factorial structure of the French WISC-V using EFA. The 15 French WISC-V primary and secondary subtest scaled scores intercorrelation matrix was used and factor extraction criteria suggested from 1 to 4 factors. To disentangle the contribution of first- and second-order factors, the Schmid and Leiman (1957) orthogonalization transformation (SLT) was applied. Overall, no EFA evidence for 5 factors was found. Results indicated that the g factor accounted for about 67% of the common variance and that the contributions of the first-order factors were weak (3.6 to 11.9%). CFA was used to test numerous alternative models. Results indicated that bifactor models produced better fit to these data than higher-order models. Consistent with previous studies, findings suggested dominance of the general intelligence factor and that users should thus emphasize the Full Scale IQ (FSIQ) when interpreting the French WISC-V.

Regression-based and prorated FSIQ estimates were calculated, and both methods revealed that approximately 70-75% of participants' FSIQ estimates fell within five Standard Score points of true FSIQ.\nResults suggest the utility of three derived 4-subtest short-form IQ estimations for use within a clinical sample.", "authors": [["Merz Zachary C"], ["Lace John W"], ["Eisenstein Alexander M"], ["Grant Alexandra F"]], "title": "Examination of Wechsler adult Intelligence Scale-Fourth Edition short-form IQ estimations in an outpatient psychoeducational sample.", "article_id": [["31747821"], ["10.1080/23279095.2019.1687480"]]}, {"abstract": "Current taxonomies of intelligence comprise two factors of mental speed, clerical speed (Gs), and elementary cognitive speed (Gt). Both originated from different research traditions and are conceptualized as dissociable constructs in current taxonomies. However, previous research suggests that tasks of one category can be transferred into the other category by simply changing the mode of administration, i.e., in form of a paper-and-pencil test or in from of a computer-based elementary cognitive task. However, cross-mode correlations for specific tasks are usually only moderate. In the present study, mental speed was assessed as a broad construct across different tasks and stimulus materials. This allowed modeling mental speed as a hierarchical construct for paper-and-pencil as well as for computer-based tests. Cross-mode correlations of the respective general factors were moderate (r = 0.64), while the cross-mode correlations of task-specific components depended on task type (r = 0.12 to r = 0.71). Only the g factors of mental speed, but not the task-specific components, were found to be related with working memory capacity as a marker of cognitive ability. The speed general factor modeled across computer-based tests was more highly correlated with working memory capacity (r = 0.66) than the general factor modeled across paper-and-pencil tests (r = 0.46).

The novelty of this research is to propose a hybrid early-warning artificial intelligence (AI) framework that can emulate hourly air quality variables (i.e., Particulate Matter 2.5, PM2.5; Particulate Matter 10, PM10 and lower atmospheric visibility, VIS), the atmospheric variables associated with increased respiratory induced mortality and recurrent health-care cost. Firstly, hourly air quality data series (January-2015 to December-2017) are demarcated into their respective intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) and a residual sub-series that reveal patterns and resolve data complexity characteristics, followed by partial autocorrelation function applied to each IMF and residual sub-series to unveil historical changes in air quality. To design the prescribed hybrid model, the data is partitioned into training (70%), validation (15%) and testing (15%) sub-sets. The online sequential-extreme learning machine (OS-ELM) algorithm integrated with improved complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (ICEEMDAN) is designed as a data pre-processing system to robustly extract predictive patterns and fine-tune the model generalization to a near-optimal global solution, which represents modelled air quality at hourly forecast horizons. The resulting early warning AI-based framework denoted as ICEEMDAN-OS-ELM model, is individually constructed by forecasting each IMF and residual sub-series, with hourly PM2.5, PM10, and VIS obtained by the aggregated sum of forecasted IMFs and residual sub-series. The results are benchmarked with many competing predictive approaches; e.g., hybrid ICEEMDAN-multiple-linear regression (MLR), ICEEMDAN-M5 model tree and standalone versions: OS-ELM, MLR, M5 model tree. Statistical metrics including the root-mean-square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), Willmott's Index (WI), Legates & McCabe's Index (ELM) and Nash-Sutcliffe coefficients (ENS) are used to evaluate the model's accuracy. Both visual and statistical results show that the proposed ICEEMDAN-OS-ELM model registers superior results, outperforming alternative comparison approaches. For instance, for PM2.5,ELM values ranged from 0.65-0.82 vs. 0.59-0.77 for ICEEMDAN-M5 tree, 0.59-0.74 for ICEEMDAN-MLR, 0.28-0.54 for OS-ELM, 0.27-0.54 for M5 tree and 0.25-0.53 for the MLR model. For remaining air quality variables (i.e., PM10 & VIS), the objective model (ICEEMDAN-OS-ELM) outperformed the comparative models. In particular, ICEEMDAN-OS-ELM registered relatively low RMSE/MAE, ranging from approximately 0.7-1.03\u00a0\u03bcg/m3(MAE), 1.01-1.47\u00a0\u03bcg/m3(RMSE) for PM2.5 whereas for PM10, these metrics registered a value of 1.29-3.84\u00a0\u03bcg/m3(MAE), 3.01-7.04\u00a0\u03bcg/m3(RMSE) and for Visibility, they were 0.01-3.72\u00a0\u03bcg/m3 (MAE (Mm-1)), 0.04-5.98\u00a0\u03bcg/m3 (RMSE (Mm-1)). Visual analysis of forecasted and observed air quality through a Taylor diagram illustrates the objective model's preciseness, confirming the versatility of early warning AI-model in generating air quality forecasts.

Descriptors were defined based on Medical Subject Headings, where associations of psychotic disorders related to the schizophrenia spectrum were suggested, as well as the \"Wechsler Scales\" descriptor. The search was conducted in November 2022 with no restriction on the date of publication to select studies that used any of the WAIS editions.

All studies presented total IQ scores, but only 20 showed results for verbal IQ (n\u2009=\u200920) or performance IQ (n\u2009=\u200919). Analyzed data indicated patients had average performance on verbal comprehension features but low average performance on perceptual reasoning, working memory, and processing speed indices. Conclusions: Executive function deficits were found in the analyzed studies, which reflect difficulties in planning and impulse control-characteristics present in the diagnosis of schizophrenia. The identification of this neuropsychological functioning contributes to the understanding of the cognitive dynamics found in schizophrenia and may help in early diagnosis, reinforcing the hypothesis that cognitive performance may be one of the indicators of psychopathologic expression.
