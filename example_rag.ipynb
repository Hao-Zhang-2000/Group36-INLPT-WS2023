      "Artificial intelligence has aided in the advancement of healthcare research. The availability of open-source healthcare statistics has prompted researchers to create applications that aid cancer detection and prognosis. Deep learning and machine learning models provide a reliable, rapid, and effective solution to deal with such challenging diseases in these circumstances. PRISMA guidelines had been used to select the articles published on the web of science, EBSCO, and EMBASE between 2009 and 2021. In this study, we performed an efficient search and included the research articles that employed AI-based learning approaches for cancer prediction. A total of 185 papers are considered impactful for cancer prediction using conventional machine and deep learning-based classifications. In addition, the survey also deliberated the work done by the different researchers and highlighted the limitations of the existing literature, and performed the comparison using various parameters such as prediction rate, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, dice score, detection rate, area undercover, precision, recall, and F1-score. Five investigations have been designed, and solutions to those were explored. Although multiple techniques recommended in the literature have achieved great prediction results, still cancer mortality has not been reduced. Thus, more extensive research to deal with the challenges in the area of cancer prediction is required.\n",

      "Artificial intelligence was recognised many years ago as a potential and powerful tool to predict disease outcome in many clinical situations. The conventional approaches using statistical methods have provided much information, but are subject to limitations imposed by the complexity of medical data. The structures of the important variants of the machine learning system artificial neural networks (ANN) are discussed and emphasis is given to the powerful analytical support that could be provided by ANN for the prediction of cancer progression and prognosis. The predictive ability of the cellular markers, DNA ploidy and cell-cycle profiles, and molecular markers, such as tumour promoter and suppressor gene, and growth factor and steroid hormone receptors in breast cancer management were also analysed. ANN systems have been successfully deployed to evaluate microRNA profiles of tumours which saliently sway cancer progression and prognosis of the disease, thus counteracting the negative implications of their numerical abundance. Finally, in this setting, the prospective technical improvements in artificial neural networks, as hybrid systems in combination with fuzzy logic and artificial immune networks were also addressed.\n",

      "Machine learning (ML) is entering many areas of society, including medicine. This transformation has the potential to drastically change medicine and medical practice. These aspects become particularly clear when considering the different stages of oncologic patient care and the involved interdisciplinary and intermodality interactions. In recent publications, computers-in collaboration with humans or alone-have been outperforming humans regarding tumor identification, tumor classification, estimating prognoses, and evaluation of treatments. In addition, ML algorithms, e.g., artificial neural networks (ANNs), which constitute the drivers behind many of the latest achievements in ML, can deliver this level of performance in a reproducible, fast, and inexpensive manner. In the future, artificial intelligence applications will become an integral part of the medical profession and offer advantages for oncologic diagnostics and treatment.\n",
