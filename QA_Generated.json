{"context": ["this study proposes a model in which aggressive and prosocial behaviors exhibited in social conflicts mediate the influence of empathy and social intelligence to children's social preference by same - sex peers. data were obtained from kindergarten to the end of the first grade. the sample yielded 117 spanish children ( 64 girls and 53 boys ) with a mean age of 62. 8 months ( sd = 3. 3 ) at the beginning of the study. for boys, affective empathy contributed to boys'social preference through a decrease in physical aggression as responses to social conflict. for girls, affective empathy had an indirect effect on girls'preference by increasing assistance to others in their conflicts. no mediating effect in the contribution of social intelligence on girls'social preference was detected. our results suggest that, only for girls, cold social intelligence can promote both indirect aggression ( coercive strategic that do not leave social preference, at least at these ages ) and behaviors that lead social preference ( such as prosocial behaviors ).", "investments over the past two decades to collect and store immunization events established a national population health data asset. the ability to track vaccine usage and storage has increased accountability, lowered wastage, protected valuable resources, and provided the correct vaccines at the right time. sixty - four immunization registries support the current immunization ecosystem, yet all investments to date have been through state and federal funding. much of the technology supporting these registries is becoming harder to support, limiting the utilization of the data. for the most part all current systems have legacy 2nd - generation technology and architectures as their foundation current technology investments in these national assets tend to be for systems that within the next five years will not be cost effectively sustainable with only federal, state and local funding. yet quality data is being reported by immunization providers across the health care network that is increasing exponentially through electronic data exchanges integrated within electronic health records ( ehr ) and pharmacy management systems ( pms ) this increase in high - quality patient immunization records creates opportunity to build immunization intelligence from the data. however, 2nd - generation immunization information systems ( iis ) limit the effective and timely use of this information. considering the increasing value of the data to public and private sectors working to close immunization care gaps in populations, supporting technology must ensure easy access this is the first of two papers that highlights the power of these national registries and the data they contain to provide opportunity intelligence to the immunization ecosystem user community. paper one illustrates the \" why \" for change and the need for a truly community collaborative path forward to move from 2nd -

increasing technology development has influenced the trajectory of l2 writing development. to address the need for enhanced writing skills among english as a foreign language ( efl ) learners, this study investigates the efficacy of automated writing evaluation ( awe ) training. a randomized controlled trial employing repeated measures was conducted, involving a participant pool of 190 chinese efl students. the study comprehensively assessed the effects of awe training, utilizing the grammarly platform - an ai - driven program - on various dimensions of writing skills, encompassing task achievement, coherence and cohesion, lexicon, and grammatical accuracy. control variables included writing self - efficacy and global english proficiency. writing skills were evaluated through the administration of an international english language testing system ( ielts ) writing sample test. the results unequivocally demonstrate that the experimental group consistently exhibited superior performance across all facets of writing skills compared to the control group. furthermore, the predictive influence of pre - test scores was pronounced in task achievement, coherence and cohesion, and lexicon, highlighting the pivotal role of learners'initial proficiency levels in shaping subsequent writing outcomes. notably, the emergence of writing self - efficacy as a significant predictor of task achievement and coherence and cohesion underscores the role of learners'beliefs and confidence in shaping their writing abilities. these findings conclusively suggest that artificial intelligence -

provider relationship. one tool to address patients'needs and prevent the negative implications of ai is through patient engagement. as it currently stands, patients have infrequently been involved in ai application development for patient care delivery. furthermore, we are unaware of any frameworks or recommendations specifically addressing patient engagement within the field of ai in health care. we conducted four virtual focus groups with thirty patient participants to understand of how patients can and should be meaningfully engaged within the field of ai development in health care. participants completed an educational module on the fundamentals of ai prior to participating in this study. focus groups were analyzed using qualitative content analysis. we found that participants in our study wanted to be engaged at the problem - identification stages using multiple methods such as surveys and interviews. participants preferred that recruitment methodologies for patient engagement included both in - person and social media - based approaches with an emphasis on varying language modalities of recruitment to reflect diverse demographics. patients prioritized the inclusion of underrepresented participant populations, longitudinal relationship building, accessibility, and interdisciplinary involvement of other stakeholders in ai development. we found that ai education is a critical step to enable meaningful patient engagement within this field. we have curated recommendations into a framework for the field to learn from and implement in future development. given the novelty and speed at which ai innovation is progressing in health care, patient engagement should be the gold standard for application development. our proposed recommendations seek to enable patient -

known property of representations, namely disentanglement. we also show that alignment is linked to the issue of undesirable correlations among concepts, also known as concept leakage, and to content -

discipline so that the field of psychology moves away from isolated publications of robot - and ai - related topics to a body of knowledge that is able to meet the demands for change, as the world is preparing for the fourth industrial revolution. we propose a definition of robopsychology that not only covers the study of the effects of robots on human behavior, but also of robots and ai themselves, as well as acknowledging how this sub - discipline may eventually be fundamentally changed through robots and ai. in this sense, our definition mirrors an already existing definition of the field of robophilosophy.", "as a tool of qualitative representation, conditional preference network ( cp - net ) has recently become a hot research topic in the field of artificial intelligence. the semantics of cp - nets does not restrict the generation of cycles, but the existence of the cycles would affect the property of cp -

level tom ). in addition, we show that inter - individual differences in executive functions predict variability in higher - level tom skills from the onset of adulthood onwards, i. e., after the complete maturation of executive functions. taken together, these results indicate that the relative contribution of tom's controlled component significantly changes with age. in particular, this implies that, over the lifespan, people may rely upon distinct cognitive architectures when reading others'minds.", "of 44 % of the variance. the authors have shown good support for the reliability and validity of the buss scale. it now needs to be tested in other universities and in different countries. it is the contention of the authors that academic tenacity will be a better measure of academic success than other competing measures, such as grit, on their own. further research is needed to test this assertion.", "despite medical school admission committees'best efforts, a handful of seemingly capable students invariably struggle during their first year of study. yet, even as entrance criteria continue to broaden beyond cognitive qualifications, attention inevitably reverts back to such factors when seeking to understand these phenomena. using a host of applicant, admission, and post -

electron closed - shell configuration. our results indicate that transition metal encapsulation is a feasible route for stabilizing medium - sized b cages, offering a useful roadmap for the discovery of more b fullerene analogues as building blocks of nanomaterials.", "brain is a heterogeneous tissue that contains neurons, neuroglia, and other cell types that vary among anatomical regions. nonneuronal cell types are broadly categorized into ( 1 ) astrocytes, ( 2 ) radial glia, ( 3 ) oligodendrocytes, ( 4 ) ependymal cells, and ( 5 ) microglia. the role of each cell type is well defined ; moreover, their interaction is essential for the neuronal function of the central nervous system. the cellular communication is substantially involved in the establishment of the majority of neurological disorders ( pham and gupta, 2009 ). brain function is determined by the communication between electrically excitable neurons and the surrounding glial cells, which perform many tasks in the brain. oligodendrocytes are one type of glial cell that form an insulating protective myelin sheath around the axons of neurons that enables saltatory nerve conduction. a loss of myelin in defined areas of brain leads to an impairment of axonal conductance. this is what happens in many forms of myelin disorders, such as multiple sclerosis, and it results in a permanent loss of neuron impulse transmission. it is evident that the demyelinated region contains inflammatory cells such as infiltrating lymphocytes and macrophages and activated microglia. these cells might potentiate or even initiate a damage cascade leading to continuous neurodegeneration. microglia are the resident phagocytic cells in the brain, taking part in immune - mediated defense mechanisms and clearing damaged cell debris ( ransohoff and cardona, 2010 ; ransohoff and perry, 2009 ). previously, it was thought that microglia, in their resting state, are relatively quiescent. more recent work suggests that microglia are constantly active and surveying their surroundings ( hughes, 2012 ; nimmerjahn", "size would be beneficial to explore potential associations more fully. therefore, additional studies are necessary to continue studying prenatal ope exposure and child neurodevelopment and behavior.", "##ma ( median bias -

known, past research hints that intraindividual changes in strategy use may also take place as the task becomes increasingly difficult ; however, intraindividual variability in raven's matrices is poorly understood. the present study aimed to ( a ) test the hypothesis that participants dynamically shift between strategies during the course of raven's matrices, as predicted by the literature, and ( b ) investigate the possibility that these shifts are moderated by individual differences in both ability and motivation. two samples of 100 participants each completed raven's advanced progressive matrices, and measures of working memory and need for cognition. the results confirmed that participants tended to turn to the less costly response elimination strategy as the difficulty of the task increased ; this variability in strategy use predicted 78 % of item - to - item variance in accuracy. working memory capacity and need for cognition predicted strategy use, and working memory capacity additionally moderated the shift toward response elimination, so that only participants with both high working memory capacity and high need for cognition continued using constructive matching in the later part of the task.

priori setting of hyperparameters. one of the main limitations of the field is the lack of stratification of results based on biological sex, given that psychosis presents differently in men and women ; hence, the necessity to tailor identification tools and data analytic strategies. timely identification and appropriate treatment are key factors in reducing the consequences of psychotic disorders. in recent years, the emergence of new analytical tools based on artificial intelligence such as supervised ml approaches showed promises as a potential breakthrough in this field. however, ml applications in everyday practice are still in its infancy.", "in the current study, artificial intelligence ( ai ) approach was used for the learning of a physical system. we applied four inputs and one output in the learning process of ai. in the learning process, the inputs are space locations of a bcr ( bubble column reactor ), which are x, y, and z coordinate as well as the amount of gas fraction in bcr. the liquid velocity is also considered as output. a variety of functions were used in learning, such as gbellmf and gaussmf functions, to examine which functions can give the best learning. at the end of the study, all of the results were compared to cfd ( computational fluid dynamics ). a three - dimensional ( 3d ) bcr was used in this research, and we studied simulation by cfd as well as ai. the data from cfd in a 3d bcr was studied in the ai domain. in ai, we tuned for various parameters to achieve the best intelligence in the system. for instance, different inputs, different membership functions, different numbers of membership functions were used in the learning process. moreover, the meshless prediction was used, meaning that some data in the bcr have not participated in the learning, and they were predicted in the prediction process, which gives us a special capability to compare the results with the cfd outcomes. the findings showed us that ai can predict the cfd results, and a great agreement was achieved between cfd computing nodes and ai elements. this novel methodology can suggest a meshless and multifunctional ai model to simulate the turbulence flow in the bcr. for further evaluation, the anfis method is compared with acofis and psofis methods with regards to model's accuracy. the results show that anfis method contains higher accuracy and prediction capability compared with acofis and psofis methods.", "information on intellectual ability, 52 % met the surveillance case definition of co -

situ melanoma will progress to an invasive tumor still cannot be determined with any certainty. when benign lesions are diagnosed as melanoma, the consequences are unnecessary psychological and physical stress for the affected patients and incurred therapy costs. vice versa, underdiagnoses in the sense of overlooked melanomas can adversely affect patients'prognoses and may necessitate more intense therapies. novel diagnostic options could reduce the number of over - and underdiagnoses and contribute to more objective diagnoses in borderline cases. one strategy that has yielded promising results in pilot studies is the use of artificial intelligence - based diagnostic tools. however, these applications still await translation into clinical and pathological routine.", "treatment of infertility has evolved as understanding of reproduction has improved. fertility promoting surgery still is performed and recent advances have broken new ground. hormonal treatments to correct gonadal dysfunction have been developed, but multiple gestation continues to be a significant complication. assisted reproductive technologies have improved such that in vitro fertilization and its variants increasingly are used to treat nearly all causes of infertility. advances in assisted reproduction are of 2 types : ( 1 ) incremental optimization of existing techniques and ( 2 ) development of new, disruptive technologies. artificial intelligence and stem cell technologies are poised to have impact in the near future.", "the authors developed an artificial intelligence ( ai ) - based algorithm for the design and optimization of a nuclear reactor core based on a flexible geometry and demonstrated a 3\u00d7 improvement in the selected performance metric : temperature peaking factor. the rapid development of advanced, and specifically, additive manufacturing ( 3 - d printing ) and its introduction into advanced nuclear core design through the transformational challenge reactor program have presented the opportunity to explore the arbitrary geometry design of nuclear - heated structures. the primary challenge is that the arbitrary geometry design space is vast and requires the computational evaluation of many candidate designs, and the multiphysics simulation of nuclear systems is very time - intensive. therefore, the authors developed a machine learning - based multiphysics emulator and evaluated thousands of candidate geometries on summit, oak ridge national laboratory's leadership class supercomputer. the results presented in this work demonstrate temperature distribution smoothing in a nuclear reactor core through the manipulation of the geometry, which is traditionally achieved in light water reactors through variable assembly loading in the axial direction and fuel shuffling during refueling in the radial direction. the conclusions discuss the future implications for nuclear systems design with arbitrary geometry and the potential for ai -

term goals, coupled with a powerful motivation to achieve. grit has been shown to be a greater predictor of success than intelligence. as the curriculum for orthopaedic trainees continues to evolve, deliberate practice for surgical skills, encouraging a growth mindset, and enhancing grit may be as important as preparation for board examinations. although talent and skill play a role in achievement, the effort put forth in developing a skill can dramatically affect the ultimate achievement. therefore, grit is a trait that can be developed. as educators, we can encourage hard work, reflection, and appropriate risk - taking. implicit biases and microaggressions occur on a daily basis within orthopaedics, and grit will be an important trait to possess in order to combat these biases. however, we also will have to work as a community to create a more welcoming culture to underrepresented groups so that we can provide the highest level of musculoskeletal care and improve patient outcomes.", "artificial intelligence ( ai ) is often heralded as a potential disruptor that will transform the practice of medicine. the amount of data collected and available in health care, coupled with advances in computational power, has contributed to advances in ai and an exponential growth of publications. however, the development of ai applications does not guarantee their adoption into routine practice. there is a risk that despite the resources invested, benefits for patients, staff, and society will not be realized if ai implementation is not better understood. the aim of this study was to explore how the implementation of ai in health care practice has been described and researched in the literature by answering 3 questions : what are the characteristics of research on implementation of ai in practice? what types and applications of ai systems are described? what characteristics of the implementation process for ai systems are discernible? a scoping review was conducted of medline ( pubmed ), scopus, web of science, cinahl, and psycinfo databases to identify empirical studies of ai implementation in health care since 2011, in addition to snowball sampling of selected reference lists. using rayyan software, we screened titles and abstracts and selected full -

like cognitive abilities is the foundation of several long - standing theories on the neurocognitive and cognitive - psychological basis of dreaming. however, direct experimental evidence is sparse and remains contentious. on the other hand, recent research has provided compelling evidence demonstrating a link between dream content and new learning, suggesting that dreams reflect memory processing during sleep. it remains to be investigated whether the extent of learning - related dream incorporation ( i. e., the semantic similarity between waking experiences and dream content ) is related to inter - individual differences in cognitive abilities. the relationship between pre - post sleep memory performance improvements and learning - related dream incorporation was investigated ( n = 24 ) to determine if this relationship could be explained by inter - individual differences in intellectual abilities ( e. g., reasoning, short term memory ( stm ), and verbal abilities ). the extent of dream incorporation using a novel and objective method of dream content analysis, employed a computational linguistic approach to measure the semantic relatedness between verbal reports describing the experience on a spatial ( e. g., maze navigation ) or a motor memory task ( e. g., tennis simulator ) with subsequent hypnagogic reverie dream reports and waking \" daydream \" reports, obtained during a daytime nap opportunity. consistent with previous studies, the extent to which something new was learned was related ( r = 0. 47 ) to how richly these novel experiences were incorporated into the content of dreams. this was significant for early ( the first 4 dream reports ) but not late dreams ( the last 4 dream reports ). notably, here, we show for the first time that the extent of this incorporation for early dreams was related ( r = 0. 41 ) to inter - individual differences in reasoning abilities.", "early - life maltreatment ( elm ) has long - lasting negative consequences and is the most important general risk factor for mental disorders. nevertheless, a number of maltreated children grow up to become healthy adults and have therefore been called'resilient '. the aim of the current study is to investigate'resilience factors'in the context of severe elm. the study was part of the large multicenter project understanding and breaking the intergenerational cycle of abuse ( ubica ). a total of 89 women were examined, 33 with elm and at least one lifetime mental disorder ( nonresilient ), 19 with elm but without lifetime mental disorders ( resilient ), and 37 without elm and without lifetime mental disorders ( controls ). elm and other circumstances before the age of 18 years were assessed with the childhood experience of care and abuse ( ceca ) interview. additional relevant person and situation factors were measured with the structured clinical interview for mental disorders ( scid -

managed epilepsy. of 894 eligible children, 506 agreed to participate, of whom 26 were then excluded because of an inability to self - report based on a standard cutoff score of receptive vocabulary lower than 70. the primary outcome of child - reported qol was measured using the child epilepsy qol questionnaire. from the child's perspective, epilepsy - specific qol is strongly related to their mental health and social support but not to their seizures. specifically, child mental health and peer support exhibit direct associations with qol ; parental support has both direct and indirect associations with qol ( via child mental health ) ; estimated verbal intelligence exerts its strongest association with qol through mental health ; and seizure status exhibits a weak relationship to qol only through mental health. among children with epilepsy aged 8 to 14 years, mental health and social support should be areas of focus in the assessment of qol. controlling seizures is insufficient care for influencing the child's perception of their life.", "the sources of reading comprehension difficulties in people with autism spectrum disorder ( asd ) are still open to discussion. we explored their ability to adapt reading strategies to different reading goals using eye -
